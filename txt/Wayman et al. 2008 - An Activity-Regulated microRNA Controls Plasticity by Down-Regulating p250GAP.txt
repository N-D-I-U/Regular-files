euronal activity regulates the development and modification of
neuronal circuitry in part by activating genetic programs.
Activity-regulated gene expression has been implicated in axon
guidance, dendrite elaboration, synapse formation, and long-lasting
synaptic plasticity (1, 2). Dendrites are the primary site of excitatory
synapses, and their morphogenesis determines both the size and
number of synaptic contacts (3). Although dendritic development
is partly controlled by intrinsic factors, neuronal activity also plays
a critical role. Indeed, the timing of afferent innervation and
synapse formation coincides with the period of maximum growth
and dendritic remodeling (3).
The transcription factor cAMP response element-binding
(CREB) protein is a key regulator of dendritic growth (4) and
activity-regulated dendritic refinement in mature neurons (5).
Although CREB is believed to be a critical regulator of neuronal
plasticity, few CREB targets have been directly linked to plasticity.
To identify these genes, we developed a novel technology, termed
serial analysis of chromatin occupancy (SACO) that facilitated the
genome-wide identification of CREB target regions (6). We focused on microRNAs (miRNAs) because the ability of these
molecules to repress gene expression is believed to play an important role in development, differentiation, proliferation, survival,
and oncogenesis (7). Interestingly, a significant fraction of miRNAs
are enriched or specifically expressed in the nervous system (8), and
transcription of some miRNAs changes dynamically during brain
development (9, 10). miRNAs have been implicated in development of neuronal asymmetry in Caenorhabditis elegans, maturation
of sensory neurons in Drosophila, and neurite outgrowth and spine
homeostasis in rodents (11–14). Although activity is believed to play
an essential role in sculpting neuronal development, miRNAs
induced by neuronal activity have not been described.
Here, we show that microRNA 132 (miR132) is an activityregulated rapid response gene in cultured hippocampal neurons
and intact mice. 2⬘O-methyl RNA inhibitors of miR132 attenuated

miR132 in cultured neurons mimicked the effects of bicuculline on
dendrite growth. We suggested (14) that miR132 regulates neuronal morphogenesis in developing neurons by repressing translation
of the Rho family GTPase-activating protein, p250GAP. In this
work, we show that neuronal activity also represses p250GAP
translation in a miR132-dependent manner. Translational repression of p250GAP is essential because a p250GAP mutant containing an altered miR132 recognition element (MRE) attenuated
activity-stimulated dendrite growth. We further show that the
miR132-mediated repression of p250GAP and regulation of
dendritic growth occur by modulating Rac family GTPases.
Results
Synaptic Activity Induces miR132 Expression. We showed (14) that

BDNF treatment increased miR132 levels in immature neurons. In
this work, we examined whether miR132 expression was also
regulated by neuronal activity. Bicuculline-mediated inhibition of
GABAA inhibitory tone increases spontaneous synaptic activity in
our hippocampal neuron culture system [7 days in vitro (DIV 7)] (5).
We used real-time PCR to quantify levels of the miR132 precursor
transcript (premiR132) and mature miR132. Bicuculline triggered
a rapid increase in expression of the miR132 precursor and mature
miR132 (Fig. 1A). As expected, mature miR132 levels lagged
induction of the precursor. Northern blot analysis confirmed the
increase in miR132 levels in response to bicuculline stimulation
[supporting information (SI) Fig. S1 A]. In situ hybridization revealed a marked increase in miR132 levels in both soma and
dendrites (Fig. S1B). This induction required activation of the
NMDA receptor (NMDA-R) because pretreatment with the selective NMDA-R antagonist amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid
(APV) attenuated the increase in miR132 expression (Fig. 1B). We
recently demonstrated that synaptic activity regulated CREBdependent transcription by activating the CaM kinase kinase
(CaMKK), CaM kinase I␥, and MEK-ERK pathway (5). We tested
whether this pathway contributed to induction of miR132 by
inhibiting CaM kinase with KN-62 and MEK-ERK with UO126.
Both agents blocked miR132 induction by bicuculline (Fig. 1C).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed binding
of CREB to the miR132 promoter in cultured hippocampal neurons and in the adult mouse hippocampus (Fig. S2). A negative
control region in the GAPDH gene was not enriched, and no
binding was detected in assays performed using a control antibody.
We next examined whether activity regulates miR132 transcription

Activity-regulated gene expression is believed to play a key role in the
development and refinement of neuronal circuitry. Nevertheless, the
transcriptional networks that regulate synapse growth and plasticity
remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that microRNA 132
(miR132) is an activity-dependent rapid response gene regulated by
the cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein pathway. Introduction of miR132 into hippocampal neurons enhanced dendrite
morphogenesis whereas inhibition of miR132 by 2ⴕO-methyl RNA
antagonists blocked these effects. Furthermore, neuronal activity
inhibited translation of p250GAP, a miR132 target, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of p250GAP mimicked miR132-induced dendrite
growth. Experiments using dominant-interfering mutants suggested
that Rac signaling is downstream of miR132 and p250GAP. We
propose that the miR132–p250GAP pathway plays a key role in
activity-dependent structural and functional plasticity.

studies have implicated the CREB pathway in depolarizationinduced dendritic growth (4). Consequently, we examined whether
miR132 might mediate this process. Dendritic morphology was
measured by CAG promoter-driven expression of an EGFPMap2B fusion gene. This fusion protein is selectively expressed in
neurons and is largely restricted to dendrites (5). Dendritic length
and branching were quantified on DIV 9. Quantitation for EGFPMAP2 or endogenous MAP2 gave indistinguishable results (5).
Bicuculline and miR132 increased total dendritic length by ⬇70%
and branching by ⬇50% (Fig. 2 A–C). As a control, we showed that
a nonneuronal miRNA, miR1-1, did not affect dendritic growth
(data not shown). KCl caused a similar change in dendritic morphology (data not shown). Both bicuculline- and KCl-stimulated
increases in dendritic length and branching were blocked by the
NMDA receptor antagonists APV (5) and 7-Cl-kynurenic acid
(Fig. S3A). Inhibition of NR2B-containing receptors with ifenprodil (Fig. S3B) or RO25-6981 (data not shown) also abolished
bicuculline-stimulated growth. None of the treatments increased
apoptosis, as measured by Hoechst staining or by quantitation of
cleaved caspase 3 (data not shown).

the miR132 precursor (Fig. 1D), and ACREB expression attenuated this increase. These data suggest that neuronal activity
regulates miR132 transcription predominantly via CREB.

but had no effect on basal dendritic length, indicating that miR132
specifically regulates activity-induced changes in dendritic morphology. Transfection of a constitutively active CREB mutant (caCREB) mimicked the bicuculline effects in a manner that was also
blocked by the 2⬘OM-132 inhibitor (Fig. 2 D–F), suggesting
that CREB regulates dendrite growth by controlling miR132
transcription.
p250GAP Is an Activity-Regulated miR132 Target. In immature neu-

rons, the Rho family GTPase-activating protein, p250GAP, is a
miR132 target (14). Consequently, we sought to determine whether
neuronal activity also regulated p250GAP via miR132. The putative miR132 MRE in p250GAP is flanked by two highly conserved
hairpin structures. We cloned a region that flanked this conserved
structure into the 3⬘-UTR of a luciferase reporter construct. The
complement of the p250GAP MRE served as a negative control.
The luciferase-MRE constructs were then expressed in hippocampal neurons with either empty vector (EV) or a vector expressing
miR132. miR132 transfection markedly suppressed luciferase activity of the p250GAP MRE luciferase construct. In contrast,
coexpression of miR132 with the reverse complement control had
no effect on luciferase activity (Fig. 3A). We next generated a
p250GAP mutant (mt-p250GAP) that contained a two-nucleotide
deletion in the miR132 MRE seed sequence to test whether this site
was required for miR132-mediated repression. Expression of
miR132 attenuated expression of WT-p250GAP but had no effect
on mt-p250GAP (Fig. 3B). Our finding that miR132 targets the
p250GAP MRE in a heterologous reporter system and that an
intact seed sequence is required for miR132-mediated repression
suggests that p250GAP is a direct miR132 target. This finding was
Wayman et al.

confirmed by showing that overexpression of miR132 in hippocampal neurons down-regulated endogenous p250GAP (Fig. 3C).
We next examined whether synaptic activity repressed p250GAP
expression and whether miR132 contributed to this regulation.
Hippocampal neurons showed strong staining for p250GAP in the
soma and dendrites. Bicuculline decreased p250GAP immunoreactivity in both compartments (Fig. 3D). Similarly, bicuculline
decreased p250GAP protein levels in a manner that depended on
NMDA-R signaling (Fig. 3E). Treatment of hippocampal neurons
with the CaMK inhibitor, KN-93, and the MEK inhibitor, UO126,
attenuated the decrease in p250GAP induced by KCl (Fig. 3F),
suggesting that depolarization-mediated repression of p250GAP
depends on CaMK-ERK-CREB signaling. Because p250GAP
mRNA levels were not affected (data not shown), we propose that
this change occurs at the level of translation.
To address whether miR132 was required for activity-dependent
suppression of p250GAP, we used cholesterol-modified 2⬘O-methyl
oligonucleotides (antagomirs) complementary to miR132 (anti2⬘OM-132) or sense controls (sense-2⬘OM-132). Treatment with
the antisense miR132 antagomir reduced the level of KCl-mediated
repression of p250GAP (Fig. 3G). In contrast, the control sense
antagomir had no effect, suggesting that down-regulation of
p250GAP contributes to miR132-regulated dendritic growth.
Activity Regulates Dendritic Growth via miR132 Inhibition of p250GAP
Translation. Next, we examined whether p250GAP repression con-

tributes to activity-mediated dendritic growth. Transfection of an
siRNA expression construct (si-p250GAP) that suppresses the
expression of endogenous p250GAP (14) increased dendritic
growth and branching by 50% (Fig. 4 A and B). Moreover,

p250GAP) attenuated activity- and miR132-dependent dendritic
growth (Fig. 4 C and D). mt-p250GAP, but not the wild-type
version, also blocked CREB-dependent dendritic growth (data not
shown). Neither WT-p250GAP or mt-p250GAP affected basal
dendritic length. These results led us to suggest that p250GAP
down-regulation is important for bicuculline- and miR132stimulated dendritic growth.
p250GAP has been reported to inhibit Rho family GTPases in
vitro (16–20). To determine which Rho family GTPases participate
in miR132- and p250GAP-regulated dendritic growth, we used
dominant-interfering mutants. Expression of dominant-negative
Rac (dnRac) and Cdc42 (dnCdc42) had little effect on basal

dendritic growth or branching (Fig. 4 E and F). In contrast, dnRac
largely blocked both miR132- and si-p250GAP-stimulated growth
and branching. These data suggest that miR132 and p250GAP
regulate dendritic growth by activating a Rac family GTPase.
Organotypic hippocampal slices retain the cellular and morphological organization of the intact hippocampus and have been used

pups were cultured for 4 days and then treated with 20 ␮M
bicuculline to mimic afferent input. Stimulation of cultured hippocampal slices with bicuculline increased premiR132 levels ⬇5fold over control slices (Fig. S4). Furthermore, the increase
in premiR132 transcription was blocked by inhibition of the
MEK-ERK and CaM kinase pathways.
We used biolistic transfection of a tomato fluorescent protein
(TFP) marker to test whether miR132 is required for activitydependent dendritic growth in the slice preparation (Fig. 5A). Both
bicuculline and miR132 expression increased dendritic length by
2-fold (Fig. 5 A and B). A 2⬘O-methyl RNA oligonucleotide that
targets miR132 had little effect under basal conditions but attenuated bicuculline-stimulated dendritic growth. siRNA-mediated
knockdown of p250GAP also stimulated dendritic growth, suggesting that activity-dependent dendritic development in hippocampal
slices similarly requires miR132 inhibition of p250GAP translation.

of miRNA rapid response genes might be to facilitate reversible
repression of gene expression.
Components of the miRNA RISC complex are enriched in
dendrites, which suggests that miRNAs might be well positioned to
repress gene expression in this cellular compartment. In support of
this idea, a recent study showed that miR134 and its target, LIMK,
were colocalized in dendrites (13). Recent studies indicate that
formation of functional miRNA–RISC complexes might also be
regulated by cellular signaling (35), and it is conceivable that
miRNA function could be regulated by signals limited to the
dendritic or synaptic compartment. Although our data indicate that
miR132 regulates morphogenesis by repressing translation of
p250GAP, we recently showed that MeCP2 is also a miR132 target
(36). Interestingly, MeCP2 has also been proposed to regulate
dendritic growth. Future experiments will address the role of the
miR132–MeCP2 pathway in dendrite growth and patterning. Bioinformatic algorithms predict other conserved targets that could also
contribute to miR132 function. The ability of miRNAs to repress
targets in a combinatorial manner suggests that these molecules
could function as neuronal coincidence detectors and contribute in
additional ways to synaptic plasticity.
Materials and Methods
Reagents and Plasmids. The following reagents were purchased from the indicated sources: UO126 (Calbiochem); STO-609, NMDA, and APV (Tocris Cookson).
The CREB antibody was described in ref. 37. Antibodies were also obtained from
the following sources: Erk2 and Ezh2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GFP (Clontech), and anti-LacZ (Promega). Map2B-GFP (5) and caCREB (38) plasmids have
been described previously. The pCAG-ACREB, pCAG-LacZ, CRE-luciferase (39),
and pCAG-miR132 (14) plasmids were also described previously. The p250GAP
miR132 MRE sequence was amplified from a human cDNA with primers GCCCCGGGAGCAATAGAGTT and TGGGAGGGGAAGGTGGTGAT and cloned into
the XbaI site of pRL-TK (Promega). The p250GAP mutant was generated by
PCR-based mutagenesis of GFP-tagged p250GAP (19) with the following primers:

antagomir oligoribonucleotides sequences are: CGACCAUGGCUGUAGACUGUUA-3⬘chol, miR132; and UAACAGUCUACAGCCAUGGUCG-3⬘chol, sense.
Cell Culture. Hippocampal neurons (2 ⫻ 105 cells per square centimeter) were
cultured from P1-2 Sprague–Dawley rats on plates coated with poly-L-lysine
(Sigma; molecular weight 300,000) as described in ref. 5. Hippocampal neurons
were maintained in Neurobasal A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27
(Invitrogen), 0.5 mM L-glutamine, and 5 ␮M cytosine-D-arabinofuranoside
(Sigma; added at 2 DIV). Hippocampal neurons were then cultured a further 3–7
days, at which time they were either transfected or treated with various pharmacological reagents as specified in the text or figure legends.
Transfection. Primary hippocampal neurons were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. In each
experiment, we optimized DNA amounts, transfection reagent amounts, and
transfection duration to minimize toxicity and maximize transfection efficiency.
None of the transfections or drug treatments had noticeable effects on apoptosis
as assessed by condensed nuclei using Hoechst staining. Luciferase and ␤-galactosidase activities were measured by using luciferase and Galacoto-Light assay
kits (Perkin–Elmer).
Quantification of Dendritic Morphology. High-density hippocampal neurons
were transfected on 5– 6 DIV and were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde, 3% sucrose,
60 mM Pipes, 25 mM Hepes, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, pH7.4) 4 days later for 20
min at room temperature. Fluorescent images were acquired by using a cooled
CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) attached to a Zeiss Axioplan2 (Carl Zeiss)
inverted microscope with a 63⫻ oil-immersion lens. Morphometric measurements were performed by using Openlab software (Improvision). Dendrites were
analyzed as described in ref. 5. Each experiment was repeated at least three times
with independent neuronal preparations.
Slice Culture and Transfection. Organotypic hippocampal slices from P5 Sprague–
Dawley rats were cultured for 3 days as described in ref. 5. To visualize dendritic
arbors, slices were transfected with pCAG-TFP (six test plasmids) by using a Helios

tion, addiction, the biological clock, and other behavioral adaptations. Recent genomic screens suggest the existence of thousands of
novel noncoding RNAs, the majority of which are not represented
on conventional microarrays (23, 24). A role for noncoding transcription in activity-regulated plasticity has not been established. In
this work, we show that the noncoding RNA, miR132, is rapidly
induced by neuronal activity. Moreover, we delineate an activityregulated miRNA pathway that regulates dendritic morphogenesis
by inhibiting translation of the synaptic protein, p250GAP. We
focused on p250GAP because it was the only predicted miR132
target that showed perfect conservation across the vertebrate
phylum. In vivo pull-down assays suggest that p250GAP potentially
regulates several Rho family GTPases (16–20), and cerebellar
granule cells from p250GAP-knockout mice show increased Cdc42
activity (18). p250GAP is enriched in the postsynaptic density
where it interacts with the NMDA NR2B receptor subunit and the
scaffold protein PSD-95 (25, 26). p250GAP also interacts with Fyn
(17), a tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates NR2B and regulates
NMDA-dependent neuronal plasticity (27). Interestingly,
p250GAP was shown to interact with ␤-catenin (26), another
regulator of synapse formation and dendrite growth (28, 29).
Collectively, these studies show that p250GAP interacts with
multiple synapse-specific proteins.
In this work, we show that neuronal activity triggers suppression
of p250GAP levels in hippocampal neurons. The regulation of
p250GAP levels by neuronal activity is markedly attenuated by
selective inhibition of the miR132 pathway. The lack of a complete
block by miR132 inhibitors may indicate that other pathways
regulate p250GAP levels as well. The ability of miR132 to repress
translation of exogenous p250GAP requires an intact
miR132MRE, suggesting that miR132 plays a major role in activitydependent regulation of p250GAP. CaM kinase II phosphorylates
p250GAP in vitro and inhibits its GTPase-activating protein function (19). Intriguingly, the localization of p250GAP at the postsynaptic density may also be regulated by NMDA receptor signaling
(19). These studies raise the possibility that NMDA receptordependent activity could also regulate p250GAP. We suggest that
down-regulation of p250GAP function in dendrites is a critical
mechanism by which neuronal activity modulates structural
plasticity.
By suppressing p250GAP levels, miR132 expression presumably
results in prolonged localized increases in Rac activity. Interestingly,
other regulators of dendrite and spine growth, such as EphB,
Kalirinin, and Tiam1, also show selectivity for Rac in hippocampal
neurons (30, 31). Several downstream effectors of Rac and Cdc42,
including Pak, Lim-kinase, and myosin heavy chain IIb, have been
proposed to regulate structural or functional dendritic plasticity
(32). Thus, we propose that miR132 regulates dendrite growth by
down-regulating p250GAP and increasing Rac activity. This pathway may also contribute to activity-regulated actin remodeling.
Neuronal activity and calcium signaling play critical roles in
dendritic development and plasticity (1, 3). In some models of
neuronal plasticity, de novo gene expression is believed to be
required for changes in synapse structure (33). In particular, the
CREB transcriptional pathway has been implicated in structural
plasticity associated with long-term facilitation (34). Inhibition of
the CREB pathway reduces dendrite growth in cortical neurons (4),
and CREB activity is necessary and sufficient for activity-regulated
dendritic plasticity (5). In this work, we provide evidence that
CREB regulates dendrite arborization via miR132. Our observation that a p250GAP MRE mutant attenuates activity- and CREBmediated dendritic outgrowth supports an essential role for the
CREB–miR132 pathway in morphological plasticity. The CREBregulated trophic factor Wnt2 also regulates activity-regulated
dendritic outgrowth. Because p250GAP interacts with the Wnt
effector, ␤-catenin, it is possible that Wnt2 also cooperates with the
miR132 pathway. Because transcriptional repression is often associated with long-lasting chromatin remodeling, one of the functions

slices were allowed to recover for 24 h before stimulation with 16 mM KCl or 20
mM bicuculline-methiodide (Tocris) for 2 days. Slices were fixed, mounted, and
imaged with a confocal microscope. Dendritic processes were measured as described above.
Western Blotting and ChIP. Western blotting was conducted as described in ref.
39. The following primary antibodies were used overnight at 4°C in Tris-buffered
saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM NaF, and 5% BSA: polyclonal antip250GAP (1:1,000) (19), monoclonal anti-GFP (Clontech), polyclonal anti-Ezh2
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and monoclonal anti-LacZ (Promega). Neonatal 7
DIV rat hippocampal neurons (2 ⫻ 106) were subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation as described in ref. 6. For chromatin immunoprecipitation from
8-week mouse hippocampus, tissue was minced into ⬇1-mm cubes and fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4°C. The fixed tissue was then
processed as for cultured neurons.
Reverse Transcription. Neurons were treated as described, and total RNA was
isolated by using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA (50 ng to 1 ␮g) was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and 50 –250 ng of random primers (Invitrogen).
Quantitative Real-Time PCR. PCRs (10 ␮l) contained 1 ␮l of 10⫻ PCR buffer
(Invitrogen), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 200 mM dNTP (Roche), 0.125– 0.25 mM primer (IDT),
13 SYBR Green I (Invitrogen), and 1 unit of platinum Taq (Invitrogen). All RT-PCR
was run on an Opticon OP346 (MJ Research) for one cycle at 95°C for 35 s, and
30 –50 cycles at 94°C for 15 s, and 68°C for 40 s. CREB ChIPs were expressed as
nanograms of purified input genomic DNA. The real-time PCR was analyzed by
using the linear standard curve method. All standard curves had an R2 of at least
0.995, were composed of a minimum of 5 points, and were linear for at least 3
orders of magnitude. To avoid plateau effects, the Ct was always positioned in the
logarithmic component of the sigmoid fluorescence curve. The Ct was selected
based solely on the maximal linearity of standard curve. RT-PCR data were
normalized to GAPDH cDNA levels also detected by real-time PCR (other housekeeping genes showed similar results). All RT-PCR data showed at least 100-fold
higher levels of product than no reverse transcriptase controls. The following

Immunocytochemistry. Hippocampal neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose, PBS, and 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) at 37°C for 15 min. The cells
were rinsed three times for 5 min in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100
in PBS for 5 min, and rinsed three times for 5 min in blocking buffer [PBS
containing 0.5% fish gelatin (Sigma), 0.05% Tween 20]. The cells were then
stained with anti-p250GAP (1:10,000) in blocking buffer for 60 min at room
temperature and washed three times for 5 min in blocking buffer. Coverslips
were mounted on glass slides and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy as described above.

In Situ Hybridization. The following fluorescein-labeled miRNA probes were
obtained from IDT: miR132 AS 5⬘-CGACCAUGGCUGUAGACUGUUA-FAM-3⬘,
miR132 scrambled 5⬘-UAACAGUCUACAGCCAUGGUCG-FAM-3⬘. Hybridization
was performed as described in ref. 40 with the following exceptions. A hybridization solution consisting of probe (300 ng/ml) and tRNA (1.9 mg/ml) was applied
to coverslips, placed in a humid chamber, and incubated overnight at 34°C. The
following day, coverslips were rinsed as described in the Exiqon protocol for
miRNA in situ hybridization of frozen tissue sections (Exiqon). Coverslips were
stained by using the Alexa Fluor 488 signal-amplification kit for fluorescein
(Invitrogen) and mounted on slides by using Vectashield Hard Set (Vector Laboratories).
Statistical Analyses. Raw data approximated normality (the Shapiro–Wilk test)
and the assumption of equal variances (Levene’s test). ANOVA and Tukey’s post
test were used to test the null hypothesis.
