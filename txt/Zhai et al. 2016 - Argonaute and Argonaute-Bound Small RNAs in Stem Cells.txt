Abstract: Small RNAs are essential for a variety of cellular functions. Argonaute (AGO) proteins
are associated with all of the different classes of small RNAs, and are indispensable in small
RNA-mediated regulatory pathways. AGO proteins have been identified in various types of stem
cells in diverse species from plants and animals. This review article highlights recent progress on
how AGO proteins and AGO-bound small RNAs regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of
distinct stem cell types, including pluripotent, germline, somatic, and cancer stem cells.
Keywords: Argonaute; Piwi; small RNAs; stem cells

1. Introduction
Small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and
Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), achieve their gene silencing functions at diverse levels of
cellular progresses, including at the transcription, RNA processing, RNA stability, translation and
post-translational levels [1,2]. These small RNAs execute their effects by associating with Argonaute
(AGO) proteins, which are further divided into three subfamilies, AGO, Piwi, and Group 3 (known as
WAGO) subfamilies. The miRNAs and siRNAs interact with AGOs, while piRNAs mainly interact
with Piwi. Since Group 3 (WAGO) subfamily is only found in worms, we focus on AGO and Piwi
in this review. Both protein subfamilies are found in a range of stem cell types and have important
roles in a variety of cellular functions, including stem cell maturation and differentiation, embryonic
development, and transposon functions [3], which critically contribute to the regulation of self-renewal,
proliferation and differentiation of stem cells via specific mechanisms [4–7]. This concise review
provides an update on recent progress regarding AGO and AGO-bound small RNAs and their
regulation of various types of stem cells, such as pluripotent, germline, somatic, and cancer stem cells.

2. The Argonaute (AGO) Family
The AGO protein family was first identified in plants. The term AGO was derived from
ago1 in Arabidopsis [8]. Shortly after the identification of ago1, several additional AGO proteins
were discovered in numerous organisms for their function in small RNA-directed silencing [9].
According to their functional domains, AGO proteins are subdivided into AGO proteins (the AGO
clade) and Piwi proteins (the Piwi clade) [10] (Table 1). A prototype member of the AGO clade is
Arabidopsis thaliana AGO1, while all Piwi proteins, share significant homology to Drosophila melanogaster
Piwi [11]. AGO proteins function by cooperating with miRNAs or siRNAs and regulate gene-silencing
at thepost-transcriptional level. Piwi proteins act by binding to piRNAs and exert their function
through silencing of transposable elements [11–13]. Group 3 subfamily is only found in worms
(Caenorhabditis elegans, known as WAGO), while AGO and Piwi subfamilies are found in a variety
of species, such as plants, yeasts, flies, and mammals. The number of AGO proteins varies among
different species, the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) has only one AGO protein, while the
nematode worm has 27 different AGO proteins. However, the structure of AGO proteins is highly
conserved. In the mouse, eight AGO proteins are categorized into two subfamilies: five to the AGO
subfamily (simplified as AGO-like) and the remaining three to the Piwi subfamily. Similarly, in
human, based on NCBI’s sequence alignment, four AGO proteins (hAGO1/EIF2C1, hAGO2/EIF2C2,
hAGO3/EIF2C3, and hAGO4/EIF2C4) and four Piwi proteins (Hiwi/Piwil1, Hili/Piwil2, Piwil3, and
Hiwi2/Piwil4) [14] have been identified. Previous expression profiling in mammalian cells revealed
that the expression of AGO subfamily members can be found in all tissues ubiquitously, whereas
expression of the Piwi proteins seems to be restricted to germ cells [4]. Recent reports, however, have
recognized somatic Piwi as well [15]. A complete tissue array of the various AGO proteins in different
tissues will provide a comprehensive gene expression profile. Such work may offer clues to reveal
potential novel functions of AGO proteins.
AGO proteins are large proteins and have a molecular weight of approximately 100 kDa.
Regardless of the subfamilies, they usually contain one variable N-terminal domain, PAZ
(Piwi-Argonaute-Zwille), MID (middle) and Piwi domains (Figure 1) [3]. The variable N-terminal
region is reported to facilitate the separation of the small RNA: target duplex [9]. PAZ domain
composes a particular binding module that anchors the 2-nt 31 overhangs of small RNAs [3], which
is critical for dsRNA processing in RNAi, as revealed by X-ray crystallography. The MID domain
binds 51 phosphates of small RNAs by a highly basic pocket, serving as an anchor of small RNAs
onto AGO proteins [16,17]. Another function of the MID domain is to repress translation through a
motif similar to eIF4E [18]. The Piwi domain contains a DDX (where X is D or H) motif, a catalytic
triad DDX, which is homologous to RNase H enzymes and renders endonuclease activity for AGO
proteins [19,20] (Figure 1). However, a DDX motif does not necessarily guarantee slicer activity [10] and
only a subset of AGO proteins can cleave [11]. In the budding yeast Kluyveromyces polysporus, it seems
that a constant glutamic acid (E) residue has to be tagged into the catalytic pocket to create a DEDD
or DEDH tetrad for slicing activity [21]. In human, endonuclease activity of AGO2 might come from
several aspects: the Piwi domain, a loop in the N terminal domain, and possibly unidentified AGO2
binding partners [22]. The 2.3 angstrom resolution crystal structure of human AGO2 has revealed
that all the characteristic AGO domains are conserved in human AGO2, and that the interaction sites
(tryptophan-binding pockets) in the Piwi domain for binding GW motif also exist [23]. QF-V motif
of Piwi domain recognizes base-paring at the 15th base of a miRNA duplex, whereas recognition
of the central nucleotides is critically dependent upon the DDDE catalytic core of AtAGO2 [24].
In addition to domains related to endonuclease activities, AGO protein motifs for small RNA sorting
and protein-protein interactions have also been characterized in more depth. For instance, MID domain
of human AGO2 has been reported to interact with fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) via
a specific binding pocket composed of one tyrosine and two lysine residues, FMRP subsequently
associates with miR-196a to silence HOXB8 mRNA [25]. Therefore, MID domain in AGO2 is critical
for miR-196’s silencing effect toward HOXB8. Human AGO2 might also function as a framework by

3. The Association of AGO Proteins and Small RNAs
RISC (RNA-induced silencing complexes). AGO proteins recruit specific small RNAs to form
RISCs, which target specific sequences in RNA or DNA in the genome (Figure 2). All types of
described small RNAs (namely miRNA, siRNA, and piRNA) are known to associate with AGO and/or
Piwi proteins to form RISCs [73]. Small RNAs in RISCs serve as guides for AGOs, which execute
enzyme functions at specific locations. Interestingly, to perform their effector functions, small RNAs
must be incorporated into AGO-protein containing complexes [74,75]. Otherwise, they would be
degraded rapidly in cells. Depending on the subcellular locations and AGO proteins associated within
the complex, different RISCs will cause cleavage of target mRNAs, inhibit translations, or perform
chromatin modification of target genes [76] (Figure 2). In miRNA pathway, only the guide strand
of small RNAs will base-pair with the target mRNA and is retained, while the passenger strand is
disposed and degraded [1]. Similarly, during the canonical siRNA pathway, RISC is brought to RNA
targets by the siRNA guide strand, and the Piwi domain of the AGO proteins is responsible for precisely
slicing target RNAs. Piwi domain cleaves at the phosphodiester bond at No. 10 and 11 nucleotides.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016, 17, 208

5 of 17

The cleaved products will have 51 -monophosphate and 31 -hydroxyl termini [77]. In the case of an
imperfect matching of siRNA and its target, two additional mechanisms are at work to silence the gene.
One is through the posttranscriptional level, such as translational repression. The other is transcription
gene silencing (TGS) by siRISCs via histone H3 or DNA methylation [1]. In addition to functioning in
gene silencing, it is reported that Arabidopsis AGOs AtAGO2 and AtAGO9 might participate in DNA
repair, although detailed mechanism of action remains to be unraveled [46].
Piwi and piRNAs. piRNAs are noncoding RNAs that bind Piwi proteins. Distinct from
miRNAs and siRNAs, piRNAs have a length of 26–31 nt. piRNAs precursors are single stranded
and are generated from repetitive sequences in the genome. Biogenesis and stability of piRNA
might rely on Piwi proteins [18], as illustrated in the so-called “Ping-Pong” model (Figure 3),
in which Piwi proteins cooperate in secondary piRNA production. piRNA-Piwi complexes also play
important roles in maintaining genome integrity by preventing excessive transposon mobilization [78],
which contributes to genome instability by replicating and/or inserting into new genomic locations.
piRNA-Piwi complexes are proposed to act at various levels to control transposon activity:
(1) At the post-transcription level, by destructing mRNA transcripts in the cytoplasm, one example
is MIWI-piRNA, which functions in the mouse germline cells [43,79]. Another example is the
regulation of maternal mRNA by piRNA and a newly identified Piwi protein, Aubergine (AUB) [80];
(2) at the transcription level, piRNA-Piwi interferes with heterochromatin assembly, which results in
transcriptional silencing [81–83]; (3) at the translation level, piRNA-Piwi interacts with translation
initiation factors, a classical example of which is the interaction of MILI, a mouse Piwi protein, with
eIF3a and eIF4G [5]. In addition, piRNAs might regulate gene expression independent of Piwi
proteins. For example, piR-55490 is reported to be able to bind mTOR mRNA directly and to induce its
degradation [84].
Construction of AGO-small RNA target network. Although sharing similar functional domains,
apparently AGO proteins have their own preference in choosing small RNA binding partners.
Traditionally, quantitative real-time PCR, degradome sequencing and 51 RLM-RACE (RNA Ligase
Mediated Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends), have been used in predicting AGO and small RNA
target pairs [85–87]. The development of high-throughput sequencing allows for global profiling of
RNAs isolated from immunopurification (RIP-seq) and by crosslinking and immunoprecipitation
(CLIP-seq or HITS-CLIP), paving the way to identification of AGO protein–small RNA-mRNA
interaction sites in both plants and animals [20,52,88–91]. Computational prediction of small RNA
targets relies on a combinatorial approach. Rules frequently are derived from previously validated
binding partners, and in silico prediction is usually the first step of providing clues of candidates for
AGO and small RNA binding partners. Indeed, identification of the small RNAs sorting into the
appropriate AGO proteins is a prerequisite for elucidating a small RNA’s function. Several observations
have been made: (1) the size of small RNAs. Different Arabidopsis AGO (AtAGO) proteins bind small
RNAs with distinct sizes. AtAGO1 or AtAGO2 is found to form complexes with small RNAs of
21 nt long, AtAGO4 and AtAGO9 with small RNAs of 24 nt in size. AtAGO5 is less selective as it
binds small RNAs in the length of 21, 22 or 24 nt; (2) chemical composition/modification of termini.
AtAGO1 binds small RNAs with a uridine at 5’, AtAGO2, AtAGO4 prefers small RNAs with an
adenosine at 5’, and AtAGO5 binds small RNAs with a cytosine at 5’ [52]. AtAGO7 is more biased in
choosing small RNAs and only forms interactions with miR390 [92]; (3) origin (precursors) of small
RNAs. A good example is that AtAGO9 preferentially forms complexes with small RNAs derived from
transposable elements (TEs) [93]. These observations have facilitated the development of protocols and
computational algorithms for identification of AGO-small RNA network in higher organisms including
mammals and humans. Additional more advanced approaches have also been developed. For instance,
high-throughput sequencing of RNA extracted from crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP)
using highly selective monoclonal antibodies have identified additional AGO binding partners.
In mouse testes, MIWI- and MILI-associated piRNAs are determined to be 29–31 or 26–28 nt in length,
respectively [94,95], confirming the predicted sites from different computer algorithms [96], offering

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016, 17, 208

increased confidence in conducting AGO HITS-CLIP in other organisms [88,91,97,98]. CLIP-seq of
AGO2 in mouse ESCs revealed that GCACUU motif in 31 UTRs and CDS correspond to miRNA seed
matches [99]. Recently, a study of analyzing 34 AGO HITS-CLIP datasets observed that in different cell
types, miRNA targets show distinct distribution patterns in the genomes, while in same cell types, the
distributions are also identical [100]. Elucidation of AGO-small RNAs-targets network with HITS-CLIP
in specific tissues or cells is revealing the regulatory mechanism of small RNAs.

4. Argonaute-Interacting Partners and Regulation of Argonaute Function
AGO-interacting proteins. Argonautes participate in many maturation processes of small RNAs
as well as gene repression pathways that are mediated by small-RNAs, which involve interactions
with diverse protein complexes. During miRNA-directed mRNA inhibition, the N-terminal domain of
GW182 proteins, which contains multiple bi amino acid repeats of glycine-tryptophan (GW), that binds
to AGO proteins. Such binding is necessary to facilitate all downstream gene silencing effects [101].
The C-terminal part of GW182, on the other hand, interacts with the poly (A)-binding protein on the
poly (A) tail of the mRNA. In addition, direct interactions of the C-terminal part with PAN2/3 and

Plant stem cells. Plant stem cells are found at the tips of roots, shoots, and developing flowers.
Stem cells located at different organs of a plant have distinct functions. The above-ground portion
of the plant is derived from the stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) [63]. The stem cells
from the meristem are committed to becoming a single central organ of the plant [4]. Loss of function
mutation of AtAGO1 (named for Arabidopsis AGO, or PINHEAD/ZWILLE in mammals), exhibits
phenotypes of both abnormal axillary meristems and leaf formation, indicating that AtAGO1 is
essential in SAM function [8]. On the other hand, AtAGO10 (PINHEAD/ZWILLE) is required for
shoot meristem formation via self-perpetuating shoot meristem divisions [59]. Apparently AtAGO1
and AtAGO10 have functional redundancy because only double mutants demonstrate impaired SAM
initiation and maintenance, which act through a pathway that is regulated by SHOOT MERISTEMLESS,
a homeobox transcription factor [60]. However, AtAGO1 and AtAGO10 act via distinct mechanisms.
AtAGO1 mainly functions through associating with miRNAs and siRNAs, and its effector complexes
cleave mRNAs via slicer activity [115]. However, AtAGO10 exerts regulatory functions through
miRNA-mediated translational repression [116]. It appears that AtAGO1 and AtAGO10 are both
important in stem cells’ temporal control. Both AGO proteins repress AP2 and HD-Zip through
miRNA miR172 and miR165/166, It is interesting to note that AtAGO1 and AtAGO10 function in
opposite ways both in accumulation of miR165/166 and in controlling the gene expression of HD-Zip
genes. In ago10 mutants, the expression of miR165/166 is increased and the expression of HD-Zip genes
is decreased. This suggests that AGO10 upregulates HD-Zip expression via decreasing miR165/166
levels by acting as a locker for miR165/166. Interestingly, AGO1 and AGO10 do not always function
in different directions as in HD-Zip gene expression regulation, and they actually both boost floral
determinacy. One possible explanation is that up- and down-regulation of different HD-Zip genes are
involved in floral determinacy [62,63].
Germline stem cells. Drosophila Piwi family member, Piwi, is expressed in both the germline and
soma. Piwi is essential for self-renewal and asymmetric division GSCs [114]. Both male and female
Piwi mutant flies are infertile, are depleted of GSCs, and their gonads contain only significantly lower
number of egg chambers or sperm bundles. Piwi maintains GSCs and controls their differentiation
in both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous manners [114]. Somatic Piwi provides a niche to
GSCs by upregulating decapentaplegic (Dpp) pathway [117,118]. Piwi also interacts with Corto, a gene
encodes a chromatin protein, which controls Piwi expression in niche cells to maintain GSCs through
an epigenetic mechanism. On the other hand, loss of Piwi also causes GSC-like tumors that persist
throughout adult life and defects in intermingled cells (ICs), the progenitor cells of escort cells and
escort cells, causing ectopic Dpp signaling and subsequent prevention of GSC differentiation [118].
Previous research has shown that Drosophila Piwi functions on genome stability maintenance in the
germline. Piwi silences transposable elements (TEs) by recruiting ~26–32 nt piRNAs [119]. However,
more recent data from a Piwi Nt mutation, which is devoid of the nuclear localization signal (NLS),
show that female flies could maintain self-renewal of the GSCs. The number of egg chambers is not
affected either. The only phenotype is the derepression of transposable elements (TE) and nuclear
accumulation of their mRNAs in the germ line. These results indicate that Piwi controls self-renewal of
GSCs via GSC niche cells but not through manipulating TE function [120] (Figure 5). In parallel, Piwi
may contribute to the differentiation of GSCs via escort cells (ECs) [121]. In addition, Piwi also interacts
with Fasciclin 3, a gene essential for somatic cyst cells in gonadal development, in a cell-autonomous
fashion. Such interaction has added a novel layer of Piwi regulation in GSCs [15]. Not only Piwi,
but also Ago1 in Drosophila plays indispensable roles in regulating GSC fate. Overexpression of Ago1
causes GSCs over-proliferation, whereas Ago1 knockout results in GSC depletion. Unlike Piwi, AGO1,
although also plays a role in GSC fate regulation, does not act upstream of “bag of marbles” (bam) and
is dispensable for bam silencing. Current data indicates that AGO1 might function either downstream
of bam or in parallel with bam [122]. In ago3 mutant flies, GSCs are not properly maintained, thus
causing reduced fertility [123].

Several human Piwi proteins have been shown to be, responsible for CSC self-renewal and cancer
metastasis in a wide range of cancer types. Increased expression of Hiwi has been correlated with a
poor prognosis for patients with soft-tissue sarcomas (STS). Another human Piwi protein is Hili, and
its expression has been correlated with pluripotent genes Oct4 and SOX2 in cancer tissues in colorectal

cancer [128]. Hiwi also seems to play a key role in proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) [129]. Hiwi also may facilitate chemoresistance in cervical cancer [130]. Further
investigation on the function of AGO/Piwi proteins in human cancers might help identify additional
tumor markers and drug targets [131].
Somatic stem cells. Somatic stem cells (SSCs) are found in unique stem cell niches located at
different adult tissues. CSCs are lineage specific, have limited proliferation and differentiation capacity,
and are only committed to certain specific cell fates. One example of SSCs is CD34+ hematopoietic stem
cells (HSCs), which represent probably one of the best characterized SSCs. Hiwi has been identified
to be expressed in human hematopoietic progenitor cells, but not in mature blood cells [132]. Miwi2
(Piwil4) is expressed in primitive hematopoietic cells. Interestingly, mice with a triple knockout of
Miwi, Mili, and Miwi2, are able to maintain hematopoiesis in long-term [133], indicating their function
is not essential for HSCs. Another example of Piwi’s function in SSCs is the requirement of Piwi in
somatic cyst stem cell, which is essential for early germ cell maintenance. Because of the indispensable
role of Piwi in GSCs, Piwi might serve as an important connection between the somatic and germline
stem cell lineages [15]. Another example of SSCs is mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). These SSCs
potentially can robustly participate in tissue regeneration and repair [134]. Piwi protein PiwiL2 and
associated piRNAs are expressed in bone marrow derived MSCs and may regulate the cell cycle of
MSCs [135].
Pluripotent stem cells. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) include embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Three Piwi genes, Miwi, Mili, and Miwi2, have been shown
to be highly expressed in ESCs when compared to fibroblasts. However, mice knocking out all three
Piwi genes are viable. Female knockout mice are able to breed although male mice are sterile. Miwi
encodes a cytoplasmic protein specifically expresses in spermatocytes and spermatids [136]. Miwi2
is a nuclear protein expresses in the embryonic and neonatal stages. Miwi2 may function to control
chromatin signatures of mESCs [137]. Furthermore, iPSCs are obtained at comparable efficiency from
fibroblasts of triple knockout mice of Miwi/Mili/Miwi2 genes, indicating that at least these three
Piwi proteins are dispensable iPSC reprogram process [138]. In human, AGO2 has been revealed to
be indispensable for self-renewal and differentiation of ESCs by both siRNA and miRNA pathways
through the research on Ago2-deficient ESCs [139]. Moreover, immunoprecipitation of human AGO2
has identified pluripotency-specific miRNAs expressed in both hESCs and iPSCs [32].
Four AGO proteins (AGO1-4) have been identified in mammals. AGO2 is the only one that has
endonucleolytic activity. Oocytes from Ago2-deficient mice are able to mature, but have abnormal
spindles and chromosomes, which prevent them from being able to cluster [140]. Female mice express
Ago2ADH , a catalytically deficient knock-in allele of Ago2, which lack the function of endo-siRNAs,
are infertile due to defects in meiosis I, indicating that catalytic activity of Ago2 is a prerequisite for
meiosis in mouse oocytes to complete. Furthermore, some retrotransposon levels have been shown
to be upregulated in Ago2ADH oocytes [141]. Similar to mammal AGO2, Drosophila ago-2 embryos
are defective in chromosome condensation, nuclear kinesis, and spindle apparatus assembly [142].
Therefore, AGO/Piwi protein bound small RNAs (miRNAs, siRNAs and piRNAs) are important
players in ESCs through TE silencing for the proper formation of chromosomal structures, as well as
gene expression regulation for normal metabolism.
6. Conclusions
The AGO protein family binds specific small RNAs in various tissues and influence stem
cell properties including self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation, at several levels of gene
expression regulation, including transcriptional and posttranscriptional repression, transposon and
retro-transposon silencing, chromosomal modification. The relationship between AGO and its
interacting proteins in gene regulation needed to be further defined. Construction of the regulation
network of AGO-small RNAs-targets from various stem cells would be better revealed the AGO and
small RNAs function. Systematic analysis on AGO modifications and regulations in stem cells are
