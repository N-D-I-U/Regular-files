An overview of miRNAs altered in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was established by
profiling the hippocampus of a cohort of 41 late-onset AD (LOAD) patients and
23 controls, showing deregulation of 35 miRNAs. Profiling of miRNAs in the
prefrontal cortex of a second independent cohort of 49 patients grouped by
Braak stages revealed 41 deregulated miRNAs. We focused on miR-132-3p which
is strongly altered in both brain areas. Downregulation of this miRNA occurs
already at Braak stages III and IV, before loss of neuron-specific miRNAs. Nextgeneration sequencing confirmed a strong decrease of miR-132-3p and of three
family-related miRNAs encoded by the same miRNA cluster on chromosome 17.
Deregulation of miR-132-3p in AD brain appears to occur mainly in neurons
displaying Tau hyper-phosphorylation. We provide evidence that miR-132-3p
may contribute to disease progression through aberrant regulation of mRNA
targets in the Tau network. The transcription factor (TF) FOXO1a appears to be a
key target of miR-132-3p in this pathway.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive age‐related dementia
characterized by amyloid plaques, neuronal tangles, neuroﬁbrillary degeneration and vascular amyloidopathy in the brain.

The cause of early‐onset AD (EOAD) is well known with
mutations in the APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes, contributing to
the accumulation of amyloid plaques. In late‐onset AD (LOAD),
genome‐wide association studies (GWAS) recently identiﬁed
more than ten other loci [reviewed in (Tanzi, 2012)], suggesting
the existence of additional molecular pathways contributing to
the disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short 22 nt RNA
molecules that bind to the transcripts of protein‐coding genes to
direct their post‐transcriptional repression and by that regulate
important physiological and pathophysiological signalling
pathways. Increasing evidence links aberrant expression of
miRNAs to neurodegenerative disorders including AD
[reviewed in (Lau & de Strooper, 2010)]. For instance, miR‐
29b was found to be downregulated in the anterior temporal
cortex of a subgroup of AD patients with high BACE1 protein
expression (Hebert et al, 2008) and decreased miR‐107 was also
observed in the temporal cortex of some AD cases (Wang et al,
2008). However, the small number of patients analyzed
represents a major issue when identifying which miRNAs are
deregulated during disease. Confounding factors, in particular
the technologies used for miRNA proﬁling which provide
deviating results (Pritchard et al, 2012), have to be considered
as well.

Profiling of microRNAs in Alzheimer’s disease

A more systematic analysis of miRNAs is clearly needed to
determine which miRNAs and molecular networks normally
controlled by such miRNAs are affected during disease
[reviewed in (Salta & De Strooper, 2012)]. We aimed here to
determine miRNA alterations in LOAD by proﬁling two large and
independent cohorts of patients using the nCounter system, a
technology proven to reliably quantify miRNAs (Wyman et al,
2011). We found numerous changes in the expression of
miRNAs in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of LOAD
patients. Of importance, downregulation of miR‐132‐3p stands
out by robustness and consistency. This observation was
conﬁrmed by real‐time PCR on the two same brain areas
initially investigated and for the temporal gyrus. In agreement,
downregulation of miR‐132‐3p in the LOAD prefrontal cortex
was also found by next‐generation sequencing of miRNAs and
by in situ hybridization. We also provide initial identiﬁcation of
miR‐132‐3p targets of relevance to LOAD, thus offering novel
insights into the pathogenesis of the disease.

RESULTS
Deregulation of miRNAs in the hippocampus of LOAD patients
We analyzed the miRNA expression proﬁle of a ﬁrst cohort made
of 41 LOAD cases and 23 age‐matched controls (clinical data in
Supporting Information Table S1). The quality of the total RNA
obtained from these post‐mortem samples was systematically
assessed (Supporting Information Fig S1A). The RNA Integrity
Number (RIN) values were relatively low, indicating fragmented
total RNA. However, raw data analysis showed that global
expression of miRNAs in the samples with lower (2 < RIN < 6)
and higher RIN values (RIN > 6) was similar (Supporting
Information Figs S1B and S2A), therefore indicating that miRNAs
were relatively resistant to RNA degradation. Because of the
discrete counting nature of the nCounter system used for miRNA
proﬁling, positive skewness (Supporting Information Fig S2B)
and overdispersion of the data (Supporting Information Fig S3B),
a statistical model based on the negative binomial distribution as
implemented in the DESeq package (Anders & Huber, 2010) was
used to call differential miRNA expression. We found that 35
(5.5%) of 641 tested miRNAs were differentially expressed
between the LOAD cases and the control group [padj < 0.05,
nbinomTest corrected for multiple testing by the Benjamini–
Hochberg (BH) procedure]. Of interest, 20 miRNAs were
downregulated and 15 were upregulated in the LOAD group
when compared to the controls (Table 1 and Fig 1A). Notably,
we identiﬁed miR‐132‐3p as the most signiﬁcantly downregulated miRNA (padj ¼ 1.57E07) together with other brain‐
enriched miRNAs such as miR‐128, miR‐136‐5p, miR‐138‐5p,
miR‐124‐3p, miR‐129‐5p and miR‐129‐2‐3p. Among the upregulated miRNAs in the LOAD group and with previous reported
expression in the brain, we found miR‐27a‐3p, miR‐142‐3p, miR‐
92b‐3p and miR‐200a‐3p (Table 1 and Fig 1A).
A supervised clustering based on Support Vector Machine
(SVM) was built to evaluate whether the 35 differentially
expressed miRNAs could be used to classify the hippocampus
samples. After training with a subset consisting of 10 LOAD cases

1614

and 10 controls, the SVM classiﬁer was tested on the 44
remaining samples including 31 LOAD cases and 13 controls.
Among the 44 samples, three (X7H, X27H, X30H) LOAD cases
were misclassiﬁed as controls whereas all the control samples
were correctly assigned, resulting in a sensitivity of 90% and a
speciﬁcity of 100% for this assay (Fig 1B). The receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve further showed an area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.96 (Fig 1C), conﬁrming the potential
application of these 35 miRNAs as markers of LOAD.
Temporal analysis of miRNAs in the prefrontal cortex of LOAD
patients
We next studied 49 prefrontal cortex samples from a second
cohort of clinically well‐deﬁned patients stratiﬁed according to
the six classical Braak stages (BRI to VI) and of seven control
samples (BR0) (clinical data in Supporting Information Table S2)
(Bossers et al, 2010). The global cellular composition in this
brain area remains well preserved over different Braak stages in
comparison to the hippocampus.
Quality assessment showed excellent total RNA integrity for
those samples when compared to those in the ﬁrst cohort studied
(Supporting Information Fig S1A). Global expression proﬁle of
miRNAs for the 49 prefrontal cortex samples was similar,
irrespective of the Braak stages and of the quality of the RNA
(Supporting Information Fig S1C). Skewness and overdispersion of
the nCounter data were observed (Supporting Information Fig S3A
and C). We therefore applied a general linear model (GLM) based
on the negative binomial distribution to ﬁnd differentially
expressed miRNAs between any two Braak stages. In total, 41
(6.4%) of 641 tested miRNAs were found to be changed
(padj < 0.05, nbinomGLMTest after BH correction) (Table 2 and
Fig 2A). The expression analysis of those 41 signiﬁcantly altered
miRNAs showed dynamic expression patterns that were characteristic of downregulated (clusters 1, 2 and 3) and upregulated
(cluster 4) miRNAs (Fig 2B). Of importance, some of the miRNA
changes were observed at early BRI and BRII stages. For instance,
the eight miRNAs in cluster 1, including miR‐132‐3p, were
upregulated between BRI and BRII, and then downregulated
between BRII and BRVI. Cluster 2 was mainly characterized by a
small loss between BRII and BRIV, followed by a steep decline
between late BRV and BRVI stages. Eleven miRNAs such as miR‐
129‐5p, miR‐129‐2‐3p, miR‐136‐5p, miR‐370, miR‐409‐5p and miR‐
487a belong to this cluster 2. Cluster 3 consisted of 10 miRNAs
showing a gradual downregulation between BR0/BRI and BRVI.
Lastly, cluster 4 was made of 12 upregulated miRNAs such as miR‐
27a‐3p, miR‐92b‐3p and miR‐200a‐3p. The complete list of
miRNAs in each of the four clusters is included in Table 2. In
addition, a comparison of miRNAs found to be deregulated
between any two Braak stages by the nbinomGLMTest implemented in DESeq to those found by two other popular algorithms,
i.e. edgeR and Voom þ Limma, shows that 40 of 41 miRNAs found
to be changed in the prefrontal cortex by DESeq were also called by
at least one of the two other methods (Supporting Information
Fig S4), therefore supporting the robustness of the analysis.
To assess to what extent differences in miRNAs could be
explained by changes in the cell types over the disease, we
analyzed the prefrontal cortex expression of miRNAs previously

shown to be enriched in rodent neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia, respectively (Jovicic et al, 2013; Lau
et al, 2008). Neuron‐enriched miRNAs were miR‐124‐3p, miR‐
127‐3p, miR‐128, miR‐129‐2‐3p, miR‐129‐5p, miR‐136‐5p, miR‐
376a‐3p and miR‐495‐3p. Of interest, downregulation of those
neuronal miRNA markers was evident between BRV and BRVI
stages (Fig 2C), supporting the idea of some neuronal loss at late
stages of disease. In contrast, microglial‐enriched miR‐142‐3p,
miR‐142‐5p, miR‐146a‐5p, miR‐150‐5p and miR‐223‐3p were
increased at late BRV and BRVI stages (Fig 2C). For
oligodendrocytes, we recorded the level of miR‐219‐2‐3p/miR‐
219‐5p and the expression of miR‐31‐5p and miR‐143‐3p was

EMBO Mol Med (2013) 5, 1613–1634

monitored for astrocytes. Again, the oligodendrocyte‐enriched
miRNAs were increased between BRV and BRVI stages but no
clear trend was found for the two astrocyte‐enriched miRNAs
(Fig 2C). More importantly, and in contrast to the late loss of
neuronal miRNA markers, downregulation of miR‐132‐3p was
remarkably strong at early and mid‐stages of disease already.
This difference in miR‐132‐3p expression was more pronounced
than what was found for the other neuronal miRNAs, clearly
indicating that downregulation of miR‐132‐3p cannot be
explained by simple cell loss (Fig 2C, indicated by arrow).
Overall, it seems likely that miRNAs that are already changing at
early and mid Braak stages are linked to the disease process itself

rather than being the result of simple alterations in cellular
composition of the diseased brain, as this would have been
reﬂected in much more dramatic expression changes of cell‐type‐
enriched miRNAs.

Because our main goal was to reliably identify individual
miRNAs deregulated in the disease, we merged the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex data to obtain a ‘high‐conﬁdence’ list
of miRNAs changed in these two brain areas. Although a vast

majority of the 66 unique miRNA alterations appeared to be
speciﬁc to one of the two brain regions investigated, an overlap
of 10 miRNAs including miR‐132‐3p, miR‐129‐5p, miR‐27a‐3p,
miR‐92b‐3p, miR‐129‐2‐3p, miR‐136‐5p, miR‐200a‐3p, miR‐370,
miR‐409‐5p and miR‐487a was found.
Deregulation of miR‐132‐3p in the hippocampus, prefrontal
cortex and temporal gyrus of LOAD patients
The 10 miRNAs from the ‘high‐conﬁdence’ list were selected for
technical validation by real‐time PCR on the hippocampus of ﬁve
LOAD cases (X1H, X14H, X29H, X32H, X9H) and ﬁve controls
(X49H, X52H, X53H, X71H, X144H). We conﬁrmed the
upregulation of miR‐92b‐3p (padj < 0.05, ANOVA corrected
for multiple testing by the BH procedure) and downregulation of
miR‐129‐2‐3p, miR‐129‐5p, miR‐132‐3p, miR‐136‐5p, miR‐370,
miR‐409‐5p and miR‐487a in the ﬁve LOAD cases when
compared to the control group (Fig 3A). Similarly to the
nCounter data, miR‐132‐3p was the most signiﬁcantly altered
miRNA (padj ¼ 2.88E04). However, we did not conﬁrm changes
in the expression of miR‐200a‐3p (padj ¼ 0.22) nor miR‐27a‐3p
(padj ¼ 0.90) (Fig 3A), therefore eight of 10 selected miRNAs
were ﬁrmly validated by two assays.
For the prefrontal cortex samples, real‐time PCR was
performed for the 10 selected miRNAs on a ﬁrst group consisting
of four controls and two early‐stages samples (BR0.2, BR0.4,
BR0.5, BR0.7, BR1.2, BR1.3) and on a second group of six late‐
stages brain samples (BR5.7, BR6.2, BR6.3, BR6.4, BR6.5,
BR6.7). Similar to the PCR validation of the hippocampus
samples, we conﬁrmed miR‐132‐3p as the most signiﬁcantly
downregulated miRNA in the prefrontal cortex (padj ¼ 1.23E03)
(Fig 3B). In addition, miR‐129‐5p and miR‐136‐5p were also
found to be differentially expressed, resulting in the validation of
only three out of 10 miRNAs (Fig 3B). Such difference in the
results, pending on sampling and/or techniques used, is an
acknowledged concern in the ﬁeld (Pritchard et al, 2012).
In addition to the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex areas,
we aimed at biologically conﬁrming the deregulation of the 10
miRNAs in a third brain region affected in LOAD. Real‐time PCR
was therefore performed on the temporal gyrus of a third cohort
of eight LOAD individuals (ﬁve BRV and three BRVI patients)

and eight apparently healthy individuals corresponding to non‐
demented cases (one BR0 and seven BRI subjects) (clinical data
in Supporting Information Table S3). There was no difference
between the two groups for miR‐129‐5p, miR‐136‐5p and seven
other miRNAs from the ‘high‐conﬁdence’ list (Fig 3C). Obviously
those miRNA changes were only seen in speciﬁc brain areas or
picked by particular techniques, implying the importance of
using orthogonal techniques when studying miRNA expression.
However, we observed for a third time a signiﬁcant downregulation of miR‐132‐3p (padj ¼ 0.02) (Fig 3C). Overall, miR‐
132‐3p was found to be downregulated in three different LOAD
brain areas of three cohorts of patients using two different
technologies, making this observation highly reproducible and
robust.
We determined whether miR‐132‐3p deregulation in LOAD
was the direct result of the inﬂammatory component of the
disease by proﬁling its expression in another brain disorder
characterized by neuroinﬂammation, i.e. multiple sclerosis
(MS). Real‐time PCR of the white matter of eight control
subjects was compared to that of six MS samples with conﬁrmed
neuroinﬂammatory process (active lesions) and matched
chronic lesions. We found that miR‐132‐3p was not differentially
expressed between active lesions and controls (p ¼ 0.83, post hoc
Tukey’s after ANOVA corrected for multiple testing by the BH
procedure) nor between chronic lesions and controls (padj
¼ 0.10) (Fig 3D). Additionally, we found higher levels of miR‐
129‐5p and miR‐370 in the active and chronic lesions when
compared to the controls (padj < 0.05). More speciﬁcally,
downregulation of miR‐92b‐3p and miR‐136‐5p was only
observed between chronic lesions and controls (Fig 3D).
Overall, these data show that LOAD and MS share some altered
miRNAs, but not miR‐132‐3p, therefore suggesting that
deregulation of this miRNA in LOAD is unlikely a direct
consequence of a general inﬂammatory process.
Deep‐sequencing of miRNAs in the LOAD prefrontal cortex
conﬁrms the deregulation of miR‐132‐3p
The nCounter system used in our study turns out to have two
major drawbacks. First, it covers only 641 well‐expressed human
miRNAs but not all the 2038 miRNAs found in the current

A. Hierarchical clustering of deregulated miRNAs. Thirty-five significant miRNAs (p < 0.05, nbinomTest after BH adjustment) obtained from 64 hippocampus
samples were hierarchically clustered using Spearman’s correlation. Horizontal bar above the heatmap indicates the control (green) and LOAD (red) groups as
defined by pathologic examination. The sample identifiers are indicated at the bottom of the heatmap and miRNAs are found on the right side. Blue colour
corresponds to low miRNA expression values and red denotes high expression values as indicated by the colour key.
B. Probability prediction of the hippocampus samples. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) training algorithm was built on a subset of 10 LOAD and 10 controls
considering the 35 differentially expressed miRNAs shown in panel A. The obtained predictors were used to test the remaining 31 LOAD cases and 13 control
samples. The index corresponds to each patient and the vertical dashed line delineates the control (left) and LOAD (right) groups. The y-axis represents the
probability of diagnosis for each of the samples as determined by the SVM classifier (predicted class). Blue and red dots correspond to the probability that the
sample belongs to the control group or the LOAD group, respectively. A sample is considered as misclassified when the probability for the predicted class is
higher than and different from the probability corresponding to the real class (as defined by clinical diagnosis). By using this binary SVM classifier, three LOAD
samples were misclassified as controls and all the controls were correctly called.
C. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the hippocampus-derived SVM classifier. The ROC curve summarizes the accuracy of the SVM built on the 35
differentially expressed miRNAs using a number of cross-validation equals to the number of predictions (n ¼ 44). This set of miRNAs was predictive of
LOAD with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 100%. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.96, with the best possible value would be one and any nonrandom prediction would be more than 0.5. Following standard convention, the true positive rate is defined as sensitivity and the false positive rate as (1specificity).

can modify the sequence of miRNAs and the nCounter system
would have not detected such editing events. To address these
two major issues, we expanded our initial proﬁling experiments

and upregulated between LOAD subjects and controls (Fig 4A

Figure 2. Differential expression of miRNAs in LOAD prefrontal cortex.
A. Hierarchical clustering of deregulated miRNAs across the Braak stages.
Forty one miRNAs were found to differ between any two Braak stages
(p < 0.05, nbinomGLMTest after BH adjustment). Hierarchical clustering of
miRNAs was obtained using Spearman’s correlation distance metric and
average linkage. The samples are indicated at the bottom of the heatmap
and miRNAs are found at the right side. Red colour in the colour key
corresponds to high expression and blue colour to low expression values.
The four colours at the top of the heatmap indicate the controls (BR0),
early-stages (BRI and BRII), mid-stages (BRIII and BRIV) and late-stages
(BRV and BRVI) of disease.
B. Time-course analysis of deregulated miRNAs across the Braak stages. The
expression of the 41 deregulated miRNAs was standardized, clustered into
four groups and plotted according to the control (BR0) and the six Braak
stages. Clusters 1, 2 and 3 correspond to downregulated miRNAs during
disease whereas cluster 4 contains the upregulated miRNAs. Downregulation was evident between BRII and III stages for the miRNAs found in
cluster 1 whilst a steep decline between BRV and VI characterized the
cluster 2. Cluster 3 contains miRNAs gradually downregulated during
disease. Cluster 4 was the only group corresponding to some upregulated
miRNAs. A biphasic expression profile was observed for clusters 1, 2 and 4
with BRII acting as pivot stage.
C. Expression of cell-type-enriched miRNAs across the Braak stages. The
nCounter normalized counts obtained from the prefrontal cortex samples
for the neuron-enriched and glia-enriched miRNAs were log2 transformed
and plotted against the controls (0) and the six Braak stages (0 to VI).
Neuron-enriched miRNAs are shown in blue, microglial-enriched in green,
astrocyte-enriched in red and oligodendrocyte-enriched miRNAs in purple.
For comparison, the most significantly downregulated miRNA i.e. miR-1323p is indicated by arrow.

the nCounter design used for proﬁling the two large cohorts of
patients, therefore representing a set of miRNAs meriting further
investigation in the future (Supporting Information Table S4).
From this limited list of 22 miRNAs, miR‐132‐5p and miR‐212‐5p

are found in cluster together with miR‐132‐3p and miR‐212‐3p
on the chromosome 17 of the human genome, between positions
1,953,200 and 1,953,700 (hg19 build). Of importance, the two
miRNAs originating from the pre‐miR‐132 precursor i.e. miR‐
132‐3p and miR‐132‐5p were both found to be downregulated
(padj ¼ 8.42E15 and 1.95E10, respectively). Moreover, miR‐
212‐3p and miR‐212‐5p were also downregulated (padj ¼ 3.04
E08 and 4.74E07, respectively) (Table 3 and Fig 4C), showing
that not only miR‐132‐3p but also the entire miR‐132/‐212 cluster
was altered in the LOAD prefrontal cortex. Real‐time PCR was
also performed on the 12 prefrontal cortex samples to conﬁrm
alteration of the miR‐132/‐212 cluster, validating the downregulation of the four miRNAs (padj ¼ 0.0005, ANOVA corrected
by the BH procedure) (Fig 4D).
Because RNA editing can affect target recognition by the
miRNAs, we surveyed adenosine to inosine (A‐I) modiﬁcation
which is the main type of editing event described in the brain
(Alon et al, 2012; Chiang et al, 2010). We detected 22 of the 29
known (A‐I) RNA editing events in the 12 libraries. Two miRNAs
were less edited in LOAD than in controls, on the borderline of
signiﬁcance level (miR‐376c‐3p and miR‐1251 with padj ¼ 0.05,
Wilcoxon two‐sample test corrected by BH procedure) (Fig 4E).
In addition, we characterized miR‐132‐3p isoforms in depth and
found decreased mono‐uridylation in LOAD (mean percent of
controls ¼ 1.52% of the total reads for miR‐132‐3p, mean percent
of LOAD ¼ 0.71%, p ¼ 0.004, Wilcoxon two‐sample test),
increased miR‐132‐3p isoform lacking 1 nt at the 3’end (mean
percent of controls ¼ 3.76% of the total reads for miR‐132‐3p,

Figure 3. Technical and biological validation of miRNA deregulation in LOAD.
A. Validation of the LOAD hippocampus data. Five controls and five LOAD patients were analyzed to validate the 10 miRNAs found to be differentially expressed in
both LOAD hippocampus and prefrontal cortex datasets. Fold changes obtained by real-time PCR were log2 transformed (Log2FC) and positive values represent
upregulated miRNAs in LOAD whereas negative values correspond to downregulated miRNAs. The miRNAs are indicated at the bottom of the bar plot.
Normalization was done with miR-9-5p.  padj < 0.05, ANOVA corrected for multiple testing by the BH procedure. Bars represent standard errors.
B. Validation of the LOAD prefrontal cortex data. Six controls/early-stage and six late-stage samples were selected to confirm expression changes of the 10
miRNAs shown in panel A. The fold changes obtained after real-time PCR between late-stage subjects and controls were log2 transformed. The three
downregulated miRNAs (miR-132-3p, miR-129-5p and miR-136-5p) found to be differentially expressed between the two groups are indicated by  . 
padj < 0.05, ANOVA corrected for multiple testing by the BH procedure. Normalization was done with miR-9-5p. Bars represent standard errors.
C. Biological validation in the LOAD temporal gyrus. The temporal gyri of eight healthy subjects and eight LOAD patients were analyzed for the expression of the
10 miRNAs found in panels A and B. The real-time PCR fold changes between LOAD and healthy subjects were log2 transformed.  padj < 0.05, ANOVA corrected
for multiple testing by the BH procedure. Normalization was achieved using SNORD47. Bars represent standard errors.
D. Deregulation of miRNAs in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The active (MS.AL) and chronic (MS.CL) lesions of eight MS patients and the white matter of six
controls (CT) were compared by real-time PCR for the expression of the 10 miRNAs initially found to be deregulated in both LOAD hippocampus and prefrontal
cortex. Normalization was done with miR-9-5p.  padj < 0.05 (Post-hoc Tukey’s HSD after ANOVA with p values adjusted for multiple testing by BH correction).

the 5’end (mean percent of controls ¼ 2.31% of the total reads
for miR‐132‐3p, mean percent of LOAD ¼ 1.77%, p ¼ 0.009,
Wilcoxon two‐sample test). Overall, these data show that miR‐
132‐3p, in addition to being downregulated, is also differentially
sequence‐modiﬁed in LOAD. Whether such changes in the miR‐
132‐3p sequence are biologically relevant to the disease remains
to be determined.
In situ hybridization of miR‐132‐3p in the human prefrontal
cortex
Given that miR‐132‐3p showed a negative correlation to the
Braak stages (r ¼ 0.63, Pearson’s correlation) and to the

ß 2013 The Authors. Published by John Wiley and Sons, Ltd on behalf of EMBO.

formation of Tau tangles in the prefrontal cortex (r ¼ 0.63,
Pearson’s correlation), ANCOVA analysis was done to determine
whether downregulation of miR‐132‐3p in LOAD could
be explained by additional covariates. The expression of
miR‐132‐3p was related to the Braak stages as expected
(p ¼ 1.449E06, ANCOVA F test) but not to sex (p ¼ 0.20) nor
to APOE genotype (p ¼ 0.50) nor to age (p ¼ 0.57) (Fig 5A–C),
therefore supporting a speciﬁc role for this miRNA in the disease.
We further determined the expression pattern of miR‐132‐3p
in the prefrontal cortex of LOAD patients and controls using
in situ hybridization. We ﬁrst investigated whether miR‐132‐3p
was expressed in a particular neuronal population. Virtually all
neurons of the prefrontal cortex (94.3  1.9%, n ¼ 8 subjects,
n ¼ 98‐219 neurons per subject) (Supporting Information Table

S5) were positive for miR‐132‐3p, suggesting a broad expression
in neurons throughout this brain area. Interestingly, the miR‐
132‐3p signal highly varied between different cortical layers
(Fig 6A–D). Layer I was negative whilst a low‐to‐moderate
staining intensity was observed in layers II and V. Of note, layers
III/IV and VI contained neurons with highest levels of miR‐132‐
3p. In agreement with the nCounter and real‐time PCR data,
neurons from layers III/IV and VI of a BRVI patient appeared to
contain lower levels of miR‐132‐3p when compared to a BRI
subject (Fig 6C and D). Although a more pronounced downregulation of miR‐132‐3p was found in layers III/IV (Fig 6E–H),
the laminar expression pattern was preserved in the BRVI
sample (Fig 6C–D), suggesting that deregulation of miR‐132‐3p
was not limited to a speciﬁc neuronal population in a deﬁned

cortical layer. As negative control, the absence of staining was
veriﬁed using a scrambled probe (Fig 6I–J).
We also investigated a potential link between downregulation
of miR‐132‐3p and presence of hyper‐phosphorylated Tau in
neuronal cells. In the prefrontal cortex of LOAD patients, Tau
tangles are predominantly localized in layers III/IV and V
neurons (Hof et al, 1990). By combining in situ hybridization
and hyper‐phosphorylated Tau immunostaining, we found
several neurons in the layers III/IV and V of a BRV sample
that were positive for both miR‐132‐3p and hyper‐phosphorylated Tau (Fig 7A–G, indicated with arrows). Particularly in
layers III/IV, miR‐132‐3p appeared to be decreased in neurons
positive for hyper‐phosphorylated Tau (Fig 7B, D and F).
However, this expression change was less evident in layer V

neurons possibly because of the weaker staining obtained for the
neurons of this cortical layer (Fig 7C, E and G). To establish if
miR‐132‐3p was linked to the Tau pathology at the single‐neuron
level, we quantiﬁed miR‐132‐3p in tangle‐positive [AT8(þ)] and
tangle‐negative [AT8()] neurons. Of interest, miR‐132‐3p
levels were signiﬁcantly lower in AT8(þ) neurons in both
layers III and V, demonstrating a negative correlation between
Tau hyper‐phosphorylation and miR‐132‐3p expression on a
single‐neuron basis (p ¼ 0.0003 and 0.0165 for layers III and V
respectively, paired Student’s t‐test) (Fig 7H). Because layer V
neurons are more prone to develop tangles than layer III
neurons, we quantiﬁed the expression level of miR‐132‐3p in
those layer V neurons and found it to be signiﬁcantly lower when
compared to layer III neurons (p < 0.0001, Mann–Whitney U
test) (Fig 7I). Overall, we established a correlation between Tau
hyper‐phosphorylation and miR‐132‐3p expression. Thus it
appears that downregulation of miR‐132‐3p goes together with
Tau hyper‐phosphorylation, a major hallmark of LOAD. The
question remains obviously whether there is also a functional
relationship between the two.
miR‐132‐3p targets FOXO1a, a protein increased in the LOAD
hippocampus
The TargetScan algorithm version 6.2 predicts 407 miR‐132‐3p
targets including several transcripts encoding proteins either
directly involved in LOAD, i.e. MAPT (coding for Tau), or known
regulators of Tau at the post‐transcriptional level, i.e. EP300,
SIRT1 and GSK3B. An additional salient feature is the prediction
of six members of the Forkhead (FOX) transcription factor (TF)
family: FOXA1, FOXN3, FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXP1 and FOXP2.
Note that other target prediction tools have conﬁrmed these
predictions as well (Supporting Information Table S6). Of
interest, when we analyzed published microarray data of
prefrontal cortex samples from the same cohort of 49 patients
analyzed here (Bossers et al, 2010), we found the enrichment of
motifs for the FOX TF family in the promoter region [500 bases
upstream the transcription start site (TSS)] of 882 upregulated
transcripts (Table 4). We found the FOX motif as signiﬁcantly
enriched (p‐value < 0.001), particularly as the 2nd strongest
enriched motif from a large collection of more than 6000 position
weight matrices (Herrmann et al, 2012) (shown in bold in Table
4). As control, we found no enrichment of any FOX motif in the
promoters of 673 downregulated genes. Instead, CREB family
motifs (CREB1 and ATF3) were enriched in this subset
(Supporting Information Table S7). These predictions have
been conﬁrmed using another independent method for motif
discovery (HOMER), and the FOX motifs remained enriched
even within very large upstream sequences of 20 kb (Supporting
Information Table S8).
Of interest, FOXO1a shows a preferential expression in the
murine hippocampus (Hoekman et al, 2006). To determine
whether miR‐132‐3p targets FOXO1a, a luciferase construct
containing 2.5 kb of the 30 Untranslated Region (30 UTR) of
human FOXO1a (positions 874‐3385 relative to the start of the
30 UTR) was co‐transfected with miR‐132‐3p in HEK‐293T cells. A
47% decreased of luciferase activity was observed in the
presence of miR‐132‐3p when compared to the co‐transfection of

EMBO Mol Med (2013) 5, 1613–1634

an irrelevant miRNA (Fig 8A). A double mutant containing two
deletions corresponding to the miR‐132‐3p binding site predicted
by TargetScan (position 2601: 50 ‐ACUGUUA‐30 ) and to a non‐
conserved binding site at position 2270 (50 ‐ACUGUUA‐30 ) was
less responsive to miR‐132‐3p (p < 0.01, ANOVA corrected by
BH procedure) (Fig 8A). In addition, we also tested the entire
30 UTR of EP300, SIRT1 and MAPT. A validated miR‐132‐3p
target, i.e. TJAP1 (Cambronne et al, 2012), was included as
positive control. Highest decreased luciferase activity was
obtained for TJAP1 (65% decreased) followed by MAPT
(57%), SIRT1 (57%) and EP300 (46%) (Fig 8A). Luciferase
constructs containing deletion of the predicted binding sites
were also less responsive to miR‐132‐3p than wild‐type
constructs (p < 0.001 for TJAP1 and SIRT1, p < 0.01 for EP300
and MAPT). Overall, a functional interaction with EP300 and
SIRT1 was conﬁrmed and in addition, two other transcripts
(MAPT and FOXO1a) encoding for additional proteins of the Tau
subnetwork were also found to interact with miR‐132‐3p,
therefore adding evidence that this miRNA could be of relevance
to LOAD. We also showed that FOXO1a was indeed increased in
LOAD patients with low miR‐132‐3p level by comparing its
expression in the hippocampus of 27 subjects including 13
selected controls and 14 LOAD patients. The controls showed
2.73‐fold more miR‐132‐3p than the LOAD subjects (Fig 8B). Of
importance, a 79% increase of FOXO1a was found in the LOAD
group (p ¼ 0.002, Welch two‐sample t‐test) (Fig 8C and D).

DISCUSSION
We show that the miR‐132/‐212 cluster is downregulated in
LOAD. In particular, the highest expressed miRNA in this cluster
i.e. miR‐132‐3p is downregulated in three different brain areas
including the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex and the
temporal gyrus. Downregulation of miR‐132‐3p was consistently
observed irrespective of the three quantitative methods used i.e.
nCounter system, real‐time PCR and deep‐sequencing. A pioneer
study done with a small cohort of subjects previously proposed
miR‐132‐3p to be deregulated in the LOAD hippocampus and
prefrontal cortex (Cogswell et al, 2008) (Supporting Information
Fig S5A and B). While this work was under revision, decreased
miR‐132‐3p was also found in the temporal cortex of a cohort of
29 patients and controls (Wong et al, 2013) and of a smaller
group of eight AD versus eight controls (Hebert et al, 2013),
demonstrating the robustness of our observation. Clearly, our
work, in addition to these three studies, strongly puts miR‐132‐
3p at the centre stage in the study of miRNAs in LOAD.
A major question of our study was to delineate to what extent
miRNA changes accompany disease and disease progression.
We attempted to obtain sufﬁciently large cohorts of LOAD
patients and controls to address this question in a statistically
sound way. While our work clearly demonstrates that miRNAs
are altered in the brain of LOAD subjects, with 35 and 41
miRNAs signiﬁcantly deregulated in the hippocampus and
prefrontal cortex, respectively, we reveal that most of the
recorded expression changes are brain area speciﬁc, with ten
miRNAs deregulated in both regions. We also provide evidence

that several of those miRNAs are changed according to the
different Braak stages that characterize the progressive severity
of the disease (Braak & Braak, 1991).
In the past years, proﬁling of miRNAs in four different brain
regions of LOAD patients was attempted (Cogswell et al, 2008;
Hebert et al, 2008; Nunez‐Iglesias et al, 2010; Wang et al, 2011).
However there is no overlap in the miRNAs identiﬁed as altered
(Supporting Information Fig 5C). This clear lack of consensus
could indeed be due to the small number of samples or the
heterogeneity of the brain tissues studied. It should be noted that
the well‐known bias in the different technologies used for
miRNA proﬁling could be a confounding factor as well (Pritchard
et al, 2012). To tackle these caveats, we used a rather large
number of patients in our study (n ¼ 123 cases compared to 57
for the four previous reports combined together). Additionally,
we carefully controlled several inter‐individual covariates such
as age, sex and post‐mortem intervals. We also proﬁled several
brain areas using different methodologies to reduce bias
introduced by the techniques. We anticipate that, in the future,
larger controlled studies with more subjects will be needed to
fully capture miRNA changes in the LOAD brain. However, a
major limiting factor to overcome is the availability of well‐
documented frozen brain samples.
Apart from brain area speciﬁc expression changes and
methodology related considerations, another important question is to what extent recorded miRNA differences reﬂect
disease related processes or more general alterations due to
modiﬁcations of cellular composition in the affected brain
regions. For instance, some of the miRNA changes may not
solely be LOAD related but could simply reﬂect a more
neuronal versus more glia‐like proﬁle. With regard to the
hippocampus samples analyzed, we found increases of
microglial‐enriched miR‐142‐3p, miR‐150‐5p and miR‐223‐3p
in the LOAD group. It is also impossible to exclude that loss of
neurons contributes to decreased miRNA‐132‐3p in those
samples. However, neuronal miRNAs decreased only (and

relatively mildly) at late stages of disease in the prefrontal
cortex, suggesting that neurodegeneration can be an explanation for loss of miRNAs at those late stages only. Several
miRNAs, such as those found in cluster 1, and including miR‐
132‐3p, emerged as being deregulated already at early Braak
stages before the appearance of major neuronal loss. We also
found that many of the downregulated genes in LOAD show a
CREB motif in their promoter regions and given that miR‐132‐
3p is regulated by CREB (Remenyi et al, 2010; Vo et al, 2005), it
is likely that active downregulation of this miRNA is taking
place during disease process. The speciﬁc deregulation pattern
of miR‐132‐3p also supports the hypothesis that this miRNA
plays a rather upstream role in the pathogenic cascade of AD.
In agreement, it is of interest to note that miRNA alterations
can be observed rather early in the brain of mouse AD models
as well. For example, the APPswe/PS1DE9 mouse model
displays 37 miRNA alterations already at 3 months of age when
there is no visible neuronal loss (Wang et al, 2009). We
therefore hypothesize that part of the neuronal toxicity caused
by Ab species is mediated, or at least reﬂected, by changes in
the expression of miRNAs. To support this view, hippocampal
neurons treated with Ab42 showed deregulation of 21 miRNAs
(Schonrock et al, 2010). It remains to be determined whether
miR‐132‐3p expression is also perturbed in the different mouse
models of the disease. Although there was no difference
observed for miR‐132‐3p in the APPswe/PS1DE9 mouse
(Wang et al, 2009), a more recent study showed this miRNA
to be downregulated in the double transgenic APP/PS1 mice at
6 months of age (Wong et al, 2013).
It is also likely that several miRNA changes recorded in our
human brain samples are related to some neuroinﬂammatory
changes occurring during disease, for instance reﬂected in the
enrichment of microglial‐speciﬁc miRNAs at late stages of
disease i.e. increased miR‐142‐3p, miR‐150‐5p and miR‐223‐3p.
Deregulation of miR‐132‐3p was not however observed in the
small group of MS patients analyzed, in agreement with a

(Log2FC) obtained for miR-132-3p, miR-132-5p, miR-212-3p and miR-212-5p were 1.67, 1.82, 1.83 and 2.03, respectively.    padj < 0.001, ANOVA

E. A-I RNA editing events in the LOAD prefrontal cortex. For each miRNA known to be (A-I) edited, the percentage of editing events at each known position was
calculated by dividing the number of reads containing the edited base by the total number of reads corresponding to the miRNA. The six controls/early-stages
(CT) libraries are indicated by blue circles and the six LOAD libraries are represented by red crosses. The number in parenthesis indicates the position on the
miRNA where the editing event occurs, with the first nucleotide at the 50 end of the miRNA being the position 1. The last number at the right side of the
parenthesis corresponds to the p value adjusted for multiple testing using the BH procedure (padj, Wilcoxon two-sample test).

Figure 5. Downregulation of miR‐132‐3p is speciﬁcally related to disease
progression.
A. Effect of the APOE genotype on miR-132-3p downregulation. The
normalized expression level of miR-132-3p in the prefrontal cortex as
determined by the nCounter system was plotted against the controls (0)
and the six Braak stages (1–6) for which the APOE genotyping was made.
The ANCOVA model was used to assess the effect of the different APOE
genotypes. For the five genotypes present in the 49 samples i.e. APOE 32,
33, 42, 43 and 44, there was no significant difference in the downregulation of miR-132-3p (ANCOVA, p ¼ 0.50). Note that APOE42 was found
for two patients only.
B. Effect of the age on miR-132-3p downregulation. All the 49 patients were
grouped into bins of 10 years, from 50 to 100 years old. For the five
different bins, we found no significant difference in the downregulation of
miR-132-3p (ANCOVA, p ¼ 0.57).
C. Effect of the sex on miR-132-3p downregulation. For the males and the
females in the cohort of 49 patients analyzed for the expression of miR132-3p in the prefrontal cortex, there was no significant difference in the
downregulation of miR-132-3p during disease progression (ANCOVA,
p ¼ 0.20).

previous study done with a larger cohort of 30 MS patients/
control subjects (Junker et al, 2009). Thus, alteration of miR‐132‐
3p is not systematically observed in a neuroinﬂammatory
context although it has been shown that miR‐132‐3p mediates
anti‐inﬂammatory signalling (Shaked et al, 2009). The targeting
of acetylcholinesterase by miR‐132‐3p may be indeed relevant
for the association of the enzyme activity with amyloid load in
LOAD (Alkalay et al, 2013; Berson et al, 2008), as well as with the
anxiety phenotype and RNA metabolism impairment that are

characteristic of the disease (Berson et al, 2012; Shaltiel et al,
2013).
The deregulation of miR‐132‐3p might be particularly relevant
to LOAD at several additional levels. For instance, miR‐132‐3p
has been involved in modulating synaptic activity and plasticity
(Wanet et al, 2012). Furthermore, miR‐132‐3p regulates
neuronal outgrowth in response to neurotrophins (Vo et al,
2005), mediates integration of newborn neurons in the adult
hippocampus and dentate gyrus (Luikart et al, 2011; Magill et al,
2010), and shapes synaptic structure (Edbauer et al, 2010) and
plasticity in the visual cortex (Mellios et al, 2011; Tognini et al,
2011). This brings us to the question which molecular targets of
miR‐132‐3p are relevant to LOAD. We analyzed deregulated
transcripts in the LOAD prefrontal cortex samples and identiﬁed
several miR‐132‐3p targets including Tau, EP300 and SIRT1, the
latter being post‐translational regulators of Tau (Min et al, 2010)
and FOXO1a. These targets were conﬁrmed using luciferase
assays and we further demonstrated upregulation of FOXO1a
protein in AD hippocampus samples, in agreement with
previous works showing that the FOXO1a transcript is
upregulated in function of the severity of the disease (Blalock
et al, 2004; Gomez Ravetti et al, 2010; Liang et al, 2012), but see
(Bronner et al, 2009). During the revision of the manuscript, a
study proposed miR‐132‐3p to regulate another member of the
FOX family of TFs, i.e. FOXO3a, which is increased in LOAD and
in turn transcriptionally activates pro‐apoptotic genes (Wong
et al, 2013). Thus, evidence increases that FOXs and the FOXOs
in particular, may be regulating important molecular pathways
relevant to LOAD. Intriguingly, we found that not only miR‐132‐
3p regulates FOXs but also many of the predicted miR‐132‐3p
targets show in their promoter regions an enrichment of motifs
for this family of TFs. We estimate the number of such co‐
regulation events mediated by miR‐132‐3p and the FOXs to be up
to 311 out of 407 (81.3%) predicted targets (Supporting
Information Fig S6).
In conclusion, we provide strong evidence for meaningful
changes in miRNA expression during LOAD and downregulation
of miR‐132‐3p as the most salient feature. Recently, alteration of
miR‐132‐3p expression has also been reported in several other
neurodegenerative diseases including schizophrenia, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington’s disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP‐43 inclusions (FTLD‐TDP)
(Chen‐Plotkin et al, 2012; Johnson et al, 2008; Miller et al, 2012;
Smith et al, 2011). Our work thus clearly indicates that miRNAs
such as miR‐132‐3p deserve further functional exploration to
deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms driving not
only LOAD but also other neurodegenerative disorders. It is not
unlikely that future studies might reveal part of those common
molecular pathways that are relevant to these conditions.

A‐D. miR-132-3p is expressed in a layer-specific manner. Thionine staining (A) and in situ hybridization for miR-132-3p (B) in consecutive prefrontal cortex
sections of a LOAD patient (BRVI) reveals that miR-132-3p is predominantly expressed in cortical layers III/IV and VI whereas layer I is devoid of signal. In
cortical layers II and V, a low-to-moderate expression of miR-132-3p is seen. The same layer-specific expression pattern is observed in a BRI subject (C and I)
and in another LOAD patient (BRVI) (D). Note the overall decrease of the miR-132-3p signal in the LOAD sample.
E‐H. miR-132-3p is constrained to neuronal structures in the prefrontal cortex. Layer III/IV neurons (E, G) express higher levels of miR-132-3p than layer VI
neurons (F, H). There is apparent overall decrease in the intensity of the signal in LOAD neurons (G, H) compared to the BRI subject (E, F).
I,J. Negative control staining with a scrambled probe. To verify the specificity of the miR-132-3p LNA probe, we hybridized consecutive tissue sections of an
early-stage patient with the miR-132-3p probe (I) or with a scrambled probe (J). The section hybridized with the scrambled probe was completely devoid of
staining whilst intense staining with the miR-132-3p probe was obtained. Scale bars in B, D and J represent 0.25 mm. Scale bar in H represents 50 mm.

A‐G. Downregulation of miR-132-3p colocalizes with hyper-phosphorylated Tau. (A) In situ hybridization of miR-132-3p (red) and immunohistochemical
detection of hyper-phosphorylated Tau (green, AT8 antibody) revealed that hyper-phosphorylated Tau builds up in some miR-132-3p positive neurons of a
BRV patient. Panels B, D, F depict tangle formation in layer III neurons (B: merge, D: AT8, F: miR-132-3p). Panels C, E, G depict tangle formation in layer V
neurons (C: merge, E: AT8, G: miR-132-3p). Arrows denote examples of miR-132-3p and AT8 colocalization. Scale bar in A corresponds to 100 mm. Scale bar in
G represents 50 mm.
H. miR-132-3p expression is decreased in tangle-bearing neurons. The average fluorescence levels of miR-132-3p in AT8(þ) and AT8() neurons in layers III
and V were quantified for one Braak V individual and two Braak VI subjects. In layer III, the average expression levels are based on 52, 81 and 190 AT8()
neurons and 18, 20 and 35 AT8(þ) neurons, respectively. In layer V, the average expression levels are based on 32, 45 and 145 AT8() neurons and 14, 17 and
41 AT8(þ) neurons, respectively. Note the significant decrease in miR-132-3p levels in AT8(þ) neurons in both cortical layers (p ¼ 0.0003 for layer III and
p ¼ 0.0165 for layer V, paired Student’s t-test).

Society Tissue Bank (London, UK). The human study was approved by
the ethical committees of the University of Leuven and by the UZ
Leuven hospital (Reference of the protocol: ML6349).

Total RNA isolation and nCounter hybridization
Prefrontal cortex samples were snap‐frozen in liquid nitrogen and grey
matter was dissected in a cryostat. Frozen hippocampus samples were
directly dissected on dry‐ice. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and puriﬁed on mirVana columns
(Ambion, Austin, TX). The active and chronic lesions of six MS patients
and the white matter of normal appearance of eight control subjects
were also dissected and snap‐frozen in TRIzol. The total RNA quality
was assessed on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA). Medium‐throughput proﬁling of miRNAs was
performed with the nCounter Human miRNA Expression Assay Kit
version 1 (Nanostring Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA). Brieﬂy, 100 ng of
total RNA was annealed to the nCounter miRNA Tag reagent, hybridized
to the Reporter CodeSet and run on a nCounter Prep Station (VIB
microarray facility, Leuven).

nCounter analysis
All R packages were downloaded from the Bioconductor (http://www.
bioconductor.org) and the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)

(http://cran.r‐project.org) repositories. The nCounter deﬁnition ﬁle from
the nCounter Human miRNA assay Kit version 1 was re‐annotated to
match the human miRNAs found in the most recent version of miRBase
(V19, August 2012). For the hippocampus samples, the nCounter data
were background subtracted using the library NanoStringNorm (version
1.1.14) and a ﬁltering step was applied to keep mean counts >20,
followed by testing for differential expression using the nbinomTest
(library DESeq, version 1.12.0) and corrected for multiple testing using
the BH false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure. For the
hierarchical clustering of hippocampus miRNAs, data were clustered
using Spearman’s correlation and average linkage method (library gplots,
version 2.11.0.1).The SVM classiﬁcation of the hippocampus samples was
performed using a linear kernel with a gamma ¼ 0.01 and cost ¼ 1
(library e1071, version 1.6‐1). The sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR)
was deﬁned as TPR ¼ True Positive/(True Positive þ False Negative). The
speciﬁcity or true negative rate (TNR) was calculated as followed:
TNR ¼ True Negative/(True Negative þ False Positive). The ROC was
determined using the library ROCR (version 1.0‐5).
The nCounter data obtained from the prefrontal cortex samples
were similarly processed except that ﬁltering was set to keep >10
mean counts and differential expression between any two Braak stages
was assessed using ANOVADEV (ﬁtNbinomGLMs in the library DESeq).
p‐values were corrected for multiple testing using the BH procedure.

The paper explained
PROBLEM:
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia.
While most of ongoing research is focused on the contribution of
Tau and the amyloid b- (Ab) protein, other molecular pathways
are involved in the neurodegenerative process underlying the
disorder. Recently, microRNAs have been recognized as important regulators of gene expression and their aberrant expression
could lead to perturbation of cellular homeostasis and ultimately
to neurodegeneration. However, little is known about the global
expression pattern of microRNAs in the brain of patients and the
molecular networks potentially regulated by such microRNAs.
Moreover, reproducibility of recorded alterations is a major issue.

RESULTS:
In our study, we found deregulation of a small subset of
microRNAs in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of AD

mismatch. Quantiﬁcation of mature miRNAs was made using the
HTSeq‐counts (version 0.5.3p9) taking into account the strand
orientation and guided with the mature miRNAs from the miRBase
v19 gff3 annotation ﬁle. After weighting by one, the low counts were
discarded (minimum 30 counts over the 12 samples). Differential
expression was done using DESeq (version 1.6.1) after top geometric
mean normalization on the 75 top expressed miRNAs (Waggott et al,
2012).
To examine miRNA editing events, we searched for previously
reported A‐G changes corresponding to A‐I editing events. The editing
frequency was calculated as the number of reads containing the A‐G
modiﬁcation divided by the total number of reads corresponding to the
same miRNA. Statistical difference between the two groups was
assessed by using the Wilcoxon two‐sample test followed by BH
correction. The data obtained from the 12 libraries have been
submitted to the GEO database under accession number GSE48552.

Detection of miR‐132‐3p by in situ hybridization
Chimeric 20 ‐O‐methyl/LNA oligoribonucleotide probes were obtained
from Ribotask (Odense, Denmark). The sequence of the miR‐132‐3p
LNA probe was:
50 ‐FAM‐lCmGmAlCmCmAlTmGmGlCmUmGlTmAmGlAmCmUlGmUmUlA‐30 with FAM denoting a ﬂuorescein tag, l a locked nucleic acid
(LNA) and m a 20 ‐O‐methyl modiﬁed ribonucleic acid. The sequence of
the scrambled probe was 50 ‐FAM‐lAmCmUlTmAmClGmCmUlAmGmUlGmUmGlGmA‐mAlCmGmClT‐30 . In situ hybridization was performed as
previously described (Shan et al, 2012). Brieﬂy, 6 mm‐thick formalin‐
ﬁxed, parafﬁn‐embedded sections were de‐parafﬁnized and boiled for
10 min in citrate buffer (pH 6.0). After de‐proteinization and de‐
lipidation, sections were prehybridized for 1 h in hybridization mix
[10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 Denhardt’s solution, 50% formamide,
600 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA]. Hybridization was performed for 90 min
at 58°C with either 25 nM of antisense or scrambled LNA probe diluted
in hybridization mix. Sections were subsequently washed for 5 min each

patients. We established miR-132-3p as being the most altered
microRNA during disease. Downregulation of miR-132-3p in
neuronal cells was inversely correlated with the appearance of
the hyper-phosphorylated form of Tau. Additional analysis of
miR-132-3p targets points to the FOX transcription factors (TFs)
as regulated by and sharing a common subset of targets with this
microRNA.

IMPACT:
Our results provide the first large scale analysis of microRNAs
altered in AD. When the disease worsens, neuronal cells show
lower amount of miR-132-3p and hyper-phosphorylated Tau
accumulates in these cells, therefore establishing the downregulation of miR-132-3p as a new marker of AD and potentially
other neurodegenerative disorders.

in 5SSC (saline‐sodium citrate buffer), 2SSC, 0.2SSC (all at 58°C)
and 5 min in PBS. For detection of the LNA probe, sections were blocked
for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti‐ﬂuorescein
coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Roche, 1:3000). The sections were
developed with NBT/BCIP colour substrate and the colour reaction was
stopped in distilled water.

Co‐detection of miR‐132‐3p and hyper‐phosphorylated Tau
Hybridization of the miR‐132‐3p LNA probe was performed as
described above. For immunological detection of miR‐132‐3p and
hyper‐phosphorylated Tau, the sections were washed for 2  5 min in
TBS and incubated with rabbit anti‐ﬂuorescein coupled to alkaline
phosphatase (1:3000) and mouse anti‐human PHF‐Tau clone AT8
(Perbio Science, 1:800) in
PBS/0.5% BSA for 1 h at RT, followed
by overnight incubation at 4°C. Sections were washed 2  5 min in
TBS and incubated for 1 h with donkey anti‐mouse DyLight488 (Bio‐
Connect, 1:1400). The auto‐ﬂuorescence was blocked by incubating
2  5 min in TBS, 7 min in 70% ethanol/0.5% Sudan Black, 2  5 min
in TBS and 2  5 min in 0.05 M Tris‐HCl (pH 8.2). The colour reaction
was performed with Fast Red TR/Napthol AS‐MX (Sigma–Aldrich
Chemie, The Netherlands) and stopped in distilled water. All sections
were coverslipped with Mowiol.

Quantiﬁcation of miR‐132‐3p levels
The images were acquired with an Axioplan microscope at 10
magniﬁcation (Carl Zeiss) and analyzed using the Image Pro Plus
software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA). For the quantiﬁcation of the miR‐132‐3p ﬂuorescence levels in AT8(þ) and AT8()
neurons, cortical layers III and V were analyzed separately. Brieﬂy, a
stretch of layer III or V was manually outlined and ﬁelds covering 50%
of the outline were randomly selected. Per ﬁeld, miR‐132‐3p
expression levels were estimated by measuring the average ﬂuorescence intensity in a circle with a diameter of eight pixels (equivalent to
51 mm2) placed in the soma of all miR‐132‐3p positive neurons.

Profiling of microRNAs in Alzheimer’s disease

Furthermore, each neuron was classiﬁed as AT8(þ) or AT8(). Finally,
the average miR‐132‐3p intensity of AT8(þ) and AT8() neurons was
calculated separately for layers III and V. Statistical signiﬁcance was
determined with a paired Student’s t‐test. For the comparison of miR‐
132‐3p levels between cortical layers, the miR‐132‐3p expression
levels were estimated by measuring the average ﬂuorescence intensity
in miR‐132‐3p positive neurons as described above.

Regulatory analysis
Differentially expressed transcripts between BRI and BRVI stages were
determined with Limma. Detection of enriched TFs on protein coding
genes was performed on 500 bp promoter sequences of 882
upregulated genes between BRVI and BRI stages (FDR < 0.05) with
the parameters for a motif collection of 6683 position weight matrices
using an empirical p‐value (Herrmann et al, 2012). The results were
conﬁrmed using Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment
(HOMER) Suite version 4.2 (Heinz et al, 2010). The program ﬁndMotifs.
pl was run on a regulatory region of 20 kb centred around the TSS and
all the other parameters were used as default to detect the signiﬁcant
motifs from their in‐house motif library (1865 motifs).

conjugated secondary antibody (for FOXO1a) or anti‐mouse‐HRP
secondary antibody (for GAPDH) and developed using the Western
Lighting Plus‐ECL chemiluminescent reagent (Perkin‐Elmer).

Author contributions
PL and BDS conceived the study, performed data analysis
and wrote the manuscript. KB obtained samples from the
Netherlands Brain Bank, performed in situ experiments, helped
in the nCounter data analysis and the writing of the manuscript
under the supervision of JV and DS. RJ and SA performed deep‐
sequencing data, RNA editing and regulatory analyses. CSF
performed real‐time PCR and Western‐blot experiments. ES
performed luciferase assays. SB, RR, DG and HS acquired
temporal gyrus samples from the Netherlands Brain Bank and
analyzed real‐time PCR data. AT collected samples from the
London Brain Bank. AS, SP and TA analyzed miR‐132‐3p targets.
TA supervised deep‐sequencing experiment. All co‐authors
provided discussion, data interpretation and contributed to the
ﬁnal version of the manuscript.

Luciferase assays
The 30 UTRs were cloned by PCR using the Phusion enzyme kit (NEB,
Ipswich, MA, USA) and human brain cDNA as template (Clontech,
Mountain View, CA, USA). For MAPT cloning, PCR was performed using a
201 kb P1‐derived artiﬁcial chromosome (PAC) containing the human
MAPT gene (Poorkaj et al, 2001). The sequences of the PCR primers used
for cloning can be found in Supporting Information Table S9. Brieﬂy,
PCR products were cut with Asc I and Xho I restriction enzymes and
cloned into the psicheck3 vector, a derivative of the psicheck2 plasmid
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) containing an Asc I site inserted into the
multiple cloning site (MCS). All plasmids were veriﬁed by dideoxy DNA
sequencing. For luciferase assays, HEK‐293T cells were grown on 24‐
well plates and transfected with 200 ng of reporter plasmid and
20 pmol of miR‐132‐3p miRIDIAN miRNA mimic (Dharmacon, Boulder,
CO, USA) or miRIDIAN miRNA negative control 1 (Dharmacon) using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cells were processed using
the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega) and analyzed using an Envision
luminescent plate reader (Perkin‐Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). For each
reporter construct, renilla activity was normalized according to that of
ﬁreﬂy. Normalized activity after co‐transfection of miR‐132‐3p with a
reporter construct was expressed as relative to that obtained after co‐
transfecting the same plasmid with miRNA negative control 1.
Statistical signiﬁcance was determined using ANOVA with correction
for multiple testing by the BH procedure.

Western‐blot
Primary antibody against FOXO1a (C29H4) was from Cell Signalling
Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Primary antibody against GAPDH (5G4)
was obtained from Hy‐Test (Turku, Finland). Protein extracts from
human hippocampus were obtained after cell lysis in RIPA buffer and
sonication. After determining the protein concentration, twenty
micrograms of proteins were resolved on Bis‐Tris gels (Invitrogen)
and transferred onto nylon membranes. After blocking with 5% non‐fat
milk in TBS/Tween‐20, blots were incubated overnight with the
different primary antibodies. After several consecutive washes in
TBS/Tween‐20, membranes were incubated with anti‐rabbit‐HRP
