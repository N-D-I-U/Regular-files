Abstract cAMP response element binding protein 1
(CREB1, CREB) is a key transcription factor that mediates
transcriptional responses to a variety of growth factors and
stress signals. CREB1 has been shown to play a critical role
in development and progression of tumors. MicroRNAs
(miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs. They posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression through pairing
with the 3′-UTR of their target mRNAs and thus regulate
initiation and progression of various types of human cancers.
Recent studies have demonstrated that a number of miRNAs
can be transcriptionally regulated by CREB1. Interestingly,
CREB1 expression can also be modulated by miRNAs, thus
forming a feedback loop. This review outlines the functional
roles of CREB1, miRNA, and their interactions in human
malignancies. This will help to define a relationship between
CREB1 and miRNA in human cancer and develop novel therapeutic strategies.

Introduction
Cancer is a complex disease that arises through a multi-step
process. Acquisition of cancer cell features involves changes
in the wiring of signaling pathways that are tightly regulated to
control processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and
metastasis [1]. Many of the signal transductions assemble to
modulate gene expression at transcriptional level via activation or repression of transcription factors. Under different
pathological conditions, the transcription factors aberrantly
initiate the transcription of cancer-related genes, thereby increasing cell proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and
suppressing apoptosis or cell-cell adhesion, which in turn lead
to cancer development [2, 3].
cAMP response element binding protein 1 (CREB1,
CREB) is a key transcription factor belonging to the basic
leucine zipper (bZIP) family [4]. CREB1 is activated through
phosphorylation at Ser133 and/or by nuclear translocation of
CREB1 coactivators [5]. It has been found to mediate transcriptional responses to a variety of growth factors and stress
signals [6] (Fig. 1). Recently, the roles of CREB1 in
tumorgenesis have also been established in many types of
solid tumors and hematological malignancies [6, 7].
Genome-wide studies have shown that the number of putative
CREB1 target genes was approximately 4000 or nearly onequarter of the human genome [8, 9]. Researches on the targets
of CREB1 used to be limited to protein-coding genes [10, 11];
however, the non-coding targets deserve further investigation.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs
that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression through
imperfect pairing with the 3′-UTR of their target mRNAs,
by inducing translational repression or degradation of
mRNAs [12]. MiRNAs have critical functions across various
biological processes, including cell development, differentiation, apoptosis, and proliferation. First identified in B cell

Fig. 1 A schematic model of CREB1 regulation in human cancers.
CREB1 binds to the conserved cAMP-responsive element (CRE) on
the promoter and mediates transcriptional responses to a variety of stimuli
including neurotransmitters, hormones, membrane depolarization, and
growth and neurotrophic factors, thereby acting as a mediator between
different signal pathways and the downstream target genes transcription.
The targets of CREB1 including both protein-coding (e.g., Bcl-2, cyclin
D1, MMPs) and non-coding genes (e.g., miR-9, miR-23a, miR-373).

Interestingly, CREB1 could also be negatively regulated by miRNAs
(e.g., miR-9, miR-34b, miR-200b), forming a negative feedback loop.
MiR-27b directly inhibits CREB1 expression and contains putative
CREB1 binding sties. Whether miR-27b is transcriptionally induced by
CREB1 deserves further experimental validation. Illustration of the upstream regulators of CREB1 was partially modified from pathway information provided by BioCarta (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Pathways/

chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [13], miRNA alterations
have been involved in the initiation and progression of many
types of human cancers [14–21]. MiRNA has also been associated with diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment in
human malignancies [15, 18]. MiRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in the majority of human cancers [19]. For example, miR-15a and miR-16-1 generally
function as tumor suppressors and downregulate BCL2 in
chronic lymphocytic leukemias and cyclin D1 in prostate cancer and mantle cell lymphoma [22]. Of particular interest is
miR-21 which tends to function as an oncogene. This miRNA
has been shown to be consistently upregulated in various cancers including lung cancer, stomach cancer, prostate cancer,
colon cancer, ovarian carcinoma, B cell lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cervical cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and breast cancer [23]. All in all, alterations of
miRNA expression have been reported in a variety of cancers
and are implicated in various processes during tumor initiation
and progression.
Although many reasons, such as genetic abnormalities, epigenetic regulation, post-transcriptional modulation, as well as
transcription factor control have been described, the causes of
miRNA aberrant expression in tumors are not well understood

[19]. The promoter regions of miRNA genes are highly similar to those of protein-coding genes, which contain CpG
islands, TATA box sequences, initiation elements, and certain
histone modifications [24, 25]. A myriad of transcription factors are involved in miRNA genes transcription
in cells [26, 27]. The transcription factors regulate
miRNA expression positively or negatively in a tissuespecific or development-specific manner. For example,
MYC stimulates expression of the miR-17-92 oncogenic
cluster in lymphoma cells [27] but inhibits expression of
several tumor suppressor miRNAs (for example, miR15a), which promote MYC-mediated tumorgenesis [28].
Recently, CREB1 has been reported to modulate the
expression of several miRNAs in human cancers, including
miR-9 in glioma [29] and miR-373 in pancreatic cancer [30].
Interestingly, miRNAs frequently act with CREB1 in
regulatory networks via feedback loops. For instance,
miR-9, which is under CREB1’s control, directly targets
CREB1 to inhibit the proliferation of glioma cells [29].
In light of the rapid pace of research into CREB1 and
miRNAs in human cancers, we perform this review for
a better understanding of the CREB1-miRNA feedback
loop.

Expression and function of CREB1 in human
cancers
Accumulating evidence has shown that CREB1 is overexpressed in numerous human cancers, including astrocytoma, breast cancer, gastric cancer, glioma, HCC, mesothelioma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer,
and prostate cancer (Table 1). CREB1 is a transcription factor
which functions as an oncogene that involves in the proliferation, survival, and metastasis of tumor cells [47]. For
instance, CREB1 is elevated in breast cancer tissues and
metastatic cancer cells and associated with poor prognosis,
metastatic potential, and nodal involvement [32, 33].
CREB1 is further shown to positively regulate the proliferation, metastasis, and bone destruction of breast cancer [32].
Seo et al. shows that CREB1 is highly expressed in most of the
NSCLC cell lines and associates with decreased survival in
patients with NSCLC [43]. CREB1 inactivation suppresses
the growth of NSCLC cells and induces apoptotic cell death
[42]. Tan and colleagues find that CREB1 is over-expressed in
gliomas, and promotes gliomagenesis by inducing the expression of oncogenic miR-23a, which represses the tumor
suppressor PTEN [37]. More recently, Barresi et al. find
the correlation between high expression of phosphorylated CREB1 (p-CREB1) and angiogenesis, recurrence
risk, and poor disease-free survival in patients with meningiomas [40]. They also demonstrate that astrocytomas and
oligodendrogliomas are characterized by distinctive patterns
of p-CREB1 expression, which provide the evidence that
CREB1 may function as a useful tool in the differential diagnosis of these two main types of gliomas [48]. Previous studies from our laboratory and others indicate that CREB1 is
positively correlated with tumor metastasis, tumor stage, poor
prognosis, and cancer cell growth in gastric cancer [36, 49]. In
addition to its dysregulation in solid tumors, CREB1 overexpression is also associated with poor outcome of acute myelocytic leukemia patients and promotes abnormal proliferation and survival of myeloid cells in vitro and in vivo [7].
In spite of all the above findings, there is also evidence
indicating that CREB1 could function as a tumor suppressor.
In line with this idea, CREB1 has been shown to suppress
AChE-R-induced, PKA-mediated proliferation of glioblastoma tumors [50]. It is interesting that CREB1 plays a proproliferative and anti-migratory role in glioma cells [29].
These data suggest that CREB1’s role in human cancers is
tissue- and/or cell type-specific, though it typically serves as
a proto-oncogenic transcription factor.

CREB1 acts as a miRNA transcription activator
A precise control of miRNA levels is essential for maintaining
normal cellular homeostasis and uncontrolled deregulation of

8489

miRNA may contribute to tumorigenesis. Interestingly, recent
ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) data
has provided evidence that CREB1 can bind to the promoter
of several miRNAs in glioma cells and regulate their transcription [37]. In the following section, we will describe some of
the verified or predicted CREB1-miRNA interactions in human cancers (Table 2, Fig. 1).
let-7i
Let-7i belongs to the let-7 family, which include 12 human
homologues and are considered as tumor suppressors because
they are frequently located at fragile sites and genomic regions
involved in cancers [14]. Downregulation of let-7i has been
correlated with tumor progression and anti-cancer drug resistance in many human malignancies [55–58]. Several groups
have identified let-7i as a metastasis-specific miRNA biomarker associated with prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC)
and let-7i is validated to target TRIM41, SOX13, SLC25A4,
SEMA4F, RPUSD2, PLEKHG6, CCND2, and BTBD3 in
CRC cell lines [59, 60]. Recent evidence has also established
let-7i as a transcriptional target of mutant p53 and repression
of let-7i exhibits a key role in enhancing migration, invasion,
and metastasis of human cancer [61]. Although let-7i plays an
important role in various cancers, little is known about how
let-7i expression is regulated. By means of bioinformaticsbased analysis, Dai et al. find that let-7i is downregulated in
apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease1 (APE1) knockdown human osteogenic sarcoma cells and contains two putative
CREB1 binding sites in its promoter. This may indicate the
potential function of CREB1 mediated by APE1 in the regulation of let-7i expression [51].
miR-9
MiR-9 has been reported to exert distinct and even opposite
functions in different types of tumors through targeting different cellular genes. MiR-9 is upregulated in bladder cancer and
promotes cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, invasion,
and chemo-resistance, partly through directly downregulating
LASS2 and CBX7 [62, 63]. Over-expression of miR-9 targets
PPARA and CDH1 and induces HCC cell growth and invasiveness [64]. Cai et al. shows that high expression of miR-9 is
correlated with aggressive clinic-pathological features and
poor prognosis in HCC patients [65]. In contrast, Higashi
and colleagues identify miR-9 as a tumor suppressor, which
inhibits cell proliferation via targeting TAZ in HCC cells [66].
We suspect that different detection methods and specimens
from different ethnic groups may account for the discrepancy.
Recently, miR-9 is proved to inhibit the proliferation of glioma cells by inhibiting CREB1 expression [29]. Moreover,
miR-9 is transcriptionally activated by CREB1, forming a
negative feedback minicircuitry [29].

MiR-21 is over-expressed in most of the solid tumors. It regulates various cellular processes, such as cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and drug resistance, by targeting
multiple tumor suppressor genes [17, 67]. Recent studies have
shown that miR-21 might be a biomarker for diagnosis and
prognosis in cancer patients [21, 68]. One of the most important proof of miR-21’s oncogenic activity may come from the
Slack laboratory who showed that over-expression of miR-21
resulted in a pre-B cell lymphoma by a genetically engineered
miR-21 mouse model. This experiment illustrates the significant impact of a single miRNA at all stages of in vivo tumor
development: initiation, maintenance and survival [69]. As a
mechanical study for upstream pathways of miR-21,
Polytarchou et al. find that the miR-21 induction by Akt2
during hypoxia partially depends upon the binding of
CREB1 to the miR-21 promoter [52]. Interestingly, miR-21
seems to be involved in a number of positive and negative
feedback loops forming with transcription factors, and these
complex regulations may explain why miR-21 is probably one
of the most dynamic miRNAs responsive to various stimuli
[70]. One evolutionary conserved double-negative feedback
module is miR-21 and its direct target NFIB, a transcription
factor involved in carcinogenesis [71].

MiR-23a belongs to the miR-23a-27a-24-2 cluster which locates in chromosome 19p13.12. It is among the most dysregulated miRNAs implicated in cancer. miR-23a, overexpressed in gastric cancer, has been reported to participate
in the FasL-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
process [72] and confer poor prognosis in patients with gastric
cancer [73]. Moreover, miR-23a is also demonstrated to stimulate TGF-beta-induced EMT by targeting E-cadherin [74],
and promote the migration and invasion of A549 cells via its
target IRS-1 [75] in lung cancer. Recently, miR-23a has been
identified to repress the tumor suppressor PTEN and confirmed as a functional downstream target of CREB1 in controlling glioma cell growth and cell survival [37]. However,
Cai et al. find that miR-23a is decreased in prostate cancer and
inhibits cancer metastasis though the PAK6-LIMK1 pathway
[76], suggesting a tissue- or cell-specific role of miR-23a in
cancers.
miR-320a
MiR-320a, belonging to the miR-320 family (miR-320a~e),
has been shown to be dysregulated in many human malignancies. MiR-320a typically functions as a tumor suppressive
miRNA and has emerged as a key regulator of tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, as well as drug resistance.

8492

Human miR-320a gene is localized at chromosome 8p21.3,
which is frequently deleted during CRC progression and
identified as a liver metastatic susceptibility locus [77, 78],
thus miR-320a has been extensively investigated in CRC
[60, 79–83]. Notably, miR-320a is found to be downregulated in liver metastases tissues compared to
matched primary CRC tissues [60, 81] and high expression of miR-320a is associated with better disease-free
survival in CRC patients [84]. Functional studies have
revealed that miR-320a decreases cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, induces G0/G1 growth arrest, and
sensitizes chemoradiotherapy in CRC by targeting
n eu r o pi l i n 1 , be t a - c at en i n , an d R ac 1 [ 80 –8 3] .
Interestingly, miR-320a is identified as a direct target
of transcriptional factor E2A and is involved in colon
cancer cell growth [79]. In addition, miR-320a exerts its
suppressive function by targeting BCR/ABL oncogene
in chronic myeloid leukemia [85], BMI-1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma [86], GNAI1 in hepatocellular carcinoma [87], IGF-1R in glioblastoma [88], ITGB3 in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma [89], and ITGB3 in
bladder cancer [90]. Intriguingly, CREB1 is found to
activate miR-320a expression and induce mitophagy
during serum starvation in cervical cancer cells and
the CREB1-miR-320a-VDAC1 axis may provide new
insights into cancer cell survival in response to environmental stresses [53].

miR-335
MiR-335 has been identified to be involved in tumorigenesis
of numerous cancers such as ovarian cancer, lung cancer,
HCC, prostate cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma,
meningioma, glioma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,
and gastric cancer [91–110]. The expression and function of
miR-335 in different human cancers are highly dependent on
the context or types of tumors. For example, Zhou [91] and
Yang et al. [96] have demonstrated that the expression of miR335 is significantly reduced in gastric cancer, and low expression of miR-335 is associated with aggressive clinical features
and invasion and metastasis. However, miR-335 seems to be a
tumor promoter in brain cancers including meningioma [105]
and glioma [109]. Over-expressed miR-335 promotes cell
proliferation and invasion by targeting Rb1 and PAX6 in meningioma and glioma, respectively. As to the regulation of
CREB1 on miR-335, Martin et al. find that CREB1 could bind
to the promoter region of miR-335 and induce miR-335 expression in HeLa cells [54]. They finally propose an ATMdependent CREB-miR-335-CtIP axis that influences homologous recombination repair (HRR) of certain double-strand
break (DSB) lesions.

Tumor Biol. (2016) 37:8487–8502

miR-373
MiR-373 is located in the chromosomal band 19q13.4 and
belongs to the miR-371-3 gene cluster (miR-371, miR-372,
miR-373, and miR-373*) [111, 112]. MiR-373 was firstly
identified as one of the human embryonic stem cell (ESC)specific miRNAs [112]. Subsequently, it is proved to be an
oncogene involving in the proliferation and tumorigenesis of
human testicular germ cell tumors by numbing the p53 pathway [111]. Later, numerous studies have shown the pivotal
roles of miR-373 in regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis,
senescence, migration, invasion, chemo-sensitivity, as well as
DNA damage repair following hypoxia stress [113]. A recent
study from Adi Harel et al. have revealed that miR-373 increases cisplatin-induced apoptosis and inhibits cell migration
by targeting RelA and PIK3CA in lung cancer cells [114].
Intriguingly, miR-373 enhances cell proliferation, invasion,
and tumor growth in pancreatic cancer and is transcriptionally
activated by CREB1 through the regulation of miR-373’s promoter [30].

CREB1 acts as a direct target of miRNA
MiRNAs regulate their targets by direct cleavage of the
mRNA or by inhibition of protein synthesis, according to
the degree of complementarities with their targets’ 3′-UTR
regions [20] and are thereby involved in the initiation and
progression of human malignancies. As a key cancer-related
pro-oncogenic gene, CREB1 has been predicted and validated
to be direct targets of many miRNAs (Table 3, Fig. 1).

miR-17-92 cluster
MiR-17-92, a miRNA polycistron also known as oncomir-1,
is among the most potent oncogenic miRNAs [124]. The miR17-92 cluster is composed of seven miRNAs (miR-17-5p,
miR-17-3p, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b-1, and
miR-92a-1) [115]. He et al. show that the miR-17-92
polycistron locating at 13q31-32 is upregulated in 65 % of
the B cell lymphoma [125]. They also find miR-17-92 cluster
acts together with MYC to accelerate tumor development
[125]. The oncogenic role of the miR-17-92 cluster is further
supported by profiling studies showing upregulation of this
cluster in cancers and evidences indicating that miR-17-92
promotes proliferation, inhibits differentiation, increases angiogenesis, and sustains cell survival [124, 126]. Attar et al.
show that miR-17-92 cluster over-expression in HEK-293
cells enhances cell proliferation and cell cycle-related genes,
including CREB1, CDK2, cyclin-D2, and c-Myc, which were
putative targets of miR-17-92.

miR-27b
As a member of the miR-23b/27b cluster, miR-27b is
frequently downregulated in various types of human
cancers [127]. Expression of miR-27b is significantly
reduced in prostate cancer, especially in metastatic,
castration-resistant tumors [128, 129]. MiR-27b significantly inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion
in prostate cancer cells by targeting GOLM1 [128] and
Rac1 [129]. Similarly, miR-27b-mediated suppression of
Sp1 [130] and LIMK1 [131] attenuate the growth and
invasion of NSCLC cells. miR-27b has also been reported to enhance drug response by activating p53dependent apoptosis and reducing CYP1B1-mediated
drug detoxification in liver and kidney cancers [132].
However, miR-27b may act as a pro-oncogenic player
in several tumors, such as HPV-associated cervical cancer
[133], glioma [134], and breast cancer [126, 135]. In addition,
we and other groups have identified CREB1 as direct target of
miR-27b in gastric carcinogenesis [36] and adipogenesis
[136]. In our previous study, we identified CREB1 as a novel
target of miR-27b in gastric cancer [36]. However, our recent
work suggested a positive correlation between CREB1 and
miR-27b in gastric cancer tissues (Online Resource Figure
S1A), which were counter to the proposed inverse relationship
between miR-27b and its target CREB1. One possible explanation is that CREB1 may act as a transcriptional activator to
induce miR-27b expression. To support this hypothesis, we
utilized miRStart [137], a source of human microRNA TSSs
(transcription start sites, http://mirstart.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/
home.php), to get the putative TSSs and promoter sequences
of miR-27b. Then, we used RegRNA2.0 [138] and PROMO
database [139] to predict potential binding sites for CREB1.
The analysis revealed the presence of several CREB1-binding
sites in the putative promoter of miR-27b (Figure S1B, C).
However, further experiments are needed to validate the relationship between CREB1 and miR-27b.

Tumor Biol. (2016) 37:8487–8502

expression can cause cell cycle abnormalities, reduce
anchorage-independent growth, and alter CREB1 target gene
expression in AML [116]. Interestingly, FOXO3a is transcriptionally responsible for miR-34b expression in breast cancer
[150], further supporting the transcription factor-miR-34b interaction in human cancers.
miR-181b
MiR-181 family members contain four highly conserved mature miRNAs (miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-181c, and miR181d) [152], which have been reported to contribute to tumor
initiation and progression. Liu et al. briefly summarize the
functional significance and clinical implications of miR181b in cancer [153]. They propose that miR-181b is a critical
link between inflammation and cancer, supported by the evidence that miR-181b inhibits CYLD to increase NF-kappaB
activity, which is required for maintaining the transformed
state [154] and regulating NF-kappaB-mediated vascular inflammation [155]. MiR-181b is over-expressed in ovarian
[156], pancreatic [157], head and neck [158], and bladder
cancers [159]. By contrast, miR-181b is downregulated in
thyroid papillary cancer [160], glioma [161, 162], astrocytoma
[163], acute myeloid leukemia [164], and prostate cancer
[165]. MiR-181b is a key regulator of the oncogenic process
involving cellular growth, apoptosis, invasion, metastasis, and
drug sensitivity. Controversial evidence is observed by two
research group reporting inconsistent expression and function
of miR-181b in gastric cancers [118, 166]. Tang et al. indicates
that miR-181b may function as a tumor suppressor in gastric
cancer cells through directly targeting CREB1 [118].
However, Guo et al. suggests that miR-181b is overexpressed in gastric cancer cells and tissues and targets
TIMP3 to increase cell proliferation, migration, and invasion
[166]. Both of the two studies include relatively small sample
size (10 to 12 pairs of gastric tissues) and meanwhile lack in
vivo confirmation. We thus suggest that further studies are
needed to validate the roles of miR-181b in gastric cancer.

miR-34b
miR-182
MiR-34b belongs to the evolutionary conserved miRNA family miR-34s [140], which are known to be the transcriptional
targets of tumor suppressor p53 [141] and are regulated by
DNA hypermethylation [142]. MiR-34b has been implicated
in the oncogenesis of colon [143], ovarian [144], prostate
[145, 146], hepatocellular [147], lung [148], pancreatic
[149], breast [150], and oral cancers [151]. MiR-34b is
prevailingly identified as an important component of the tumor suppressor network during carcinogenesis; however, increased miR-34b is observed by Hiyoshi et al. in advanced
colon tumors and is associated with poor survival of cancer
patients [142]. Pigazzi et al. find that miR-34b directly target
CREB1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [116]. MiR-34b

MiR-182, a member of the evolutionarily conserved miR183-96-182 cluster, has been demonstrated to play important
roles in a variety of cancers [167]. MiR-182 is upregulated in
most types of tumors [168] and participate in apoptosis,
growth, differentiation, metastasis and chemo-sensitivity of
cancer cells [169–176]. For example, CEBPA and RASA1
targeting miR-182 has been shown to be upregulated and promote angiogenesis in HCC [171, 177]. By comparing the
expression of miRNAs in metastatic and non-metastatic primary mouse sarcomas, Sachdeva et al. find that miR-182 is
over-expressed in tumors metastasized to the lungs [172].
MiR-182 is identified as a metastasis driver of primary

Tumor Biol. (2016) 37:8487–8502

sarcomas by targeting multiple genes [172]. However, reports
on the expression and function of miR-182 in gastric cancer
are controversial [167]. Kong [49] and Tang et al. [178] find
that miR-182 is downregulated in gastric carcinoma and inhibits proliferation through targeting oncogenic CREB1 and
ANUBL1. Li et al. report that miR-182 is upregulated in
intestinal-type gastric cancers and increases along with tumor
stage [179]. Similar to miR-181b, larger samples and in vivo
assays may be useful to further elucidate the exact roles of
miR-182 in gastric cancer.
miR-200b
Members of the miR-200 miRNA family (miR-200a,
miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429) are mainly downregulated in human cancer cells and tissues and
play a crucial role in the suppression of EMT, tumor
cell adhesion, migration, invasion, metastasis, and cancer
chemo-sensitivity [19, 180, 181]. MiR-200b is found to be
lost in invasive breast cancer cell lines with mesenchymal
phenotype and prevent TGF-beta-induced EMT and tumor
metastasis, by targeting the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 and ZEB2 [182]. Additionally, ZEB1 and ZEB2
have been found to bind directly to an E-box proximal minimal promoter element and repress miR-200b expression in
mesenchymal human breast cancer cells, demonstrating a potential double-negative feedback loop between ZEB1/ZEB2
and miR-200b during EMT and tumorigenesis [183]. More
recently, Wu et al. have also reported a negative feedback loop
between miR-200b and the NF-kappaB pathway via IKBKB/
IKK-beta in breast cancer cells [184]. They demonstrate that
miR-200b, a transcriptional target of NF-kappaB, suppresses
breast cancer cell growth and migration as well as NF-kappaB
activation through the downregulation of IKBKB.
Interestingly, the transcription factor CREB1 is proved to be
a direct target of miR-200b in glioma [119] and gastric cancer
[36]. Whether there exists a feedback loop between transcription factor CREB1 and miR-200b warrants further
investigation.
miR-203
MiR-203 has been reported to be a tumor suppressor and
EMT-associated miRNA which is silenced in different malignancies. It is reported that miR-203 inhibits cell proliferation,
adhesion, migration, invasion, metastasis as well as enhances
chemo-sensitivity in cancer cells [120, 185–188]. MiR-203
suppression in gastric cancer promotes Slug-mediated cancer
metastasis [189]. Similarly, miR-203 acts as a growthsuppressive miRNA in Helicobacter pylori-related gastric
cancer by repressing CASK expression [186]. A retrospective
study by Imaoka et al. shows that low serum miR-203 expression is an independent predictive marker for lymph node,

8495

peritoneal, and distant metastases and associates with poor
prognosis in patients with gastric cancer [185]. MiR203 suppresses the proliferation, migration, and invasion
and promotes the apoptosis of lung cancer cells by
targeting Bmi1, FZD2, and SRC [190–192]. MiR-203
enhances 5-FU chemo-sensitivity via downregulating
TYMS in CRC [193] and attenuates cell proliferation,
invasion, and migration by suppressing ZNF217 [194].
MiR-203 is a tumor suppressor miRNA inhibiting cellular
proliferation by directly targeting CREB1 [121] and regulating its downstream targets, MITF and RAB27a [120, 122] in
melanoma cells.
miR-433
For the last decade, extensive research has identified the pivotal role of miR-433 in human cancers, including ovarian
cancer [195, 196], gastric cancer [197], myeloproliferative
neoplasms [198], lung cancer [199], and HCC [123].
Expression of miR-433 is downregulated in gastric carcinoma
[200–202], which is associated with unfavorable overall survival [197]. MiR-433 inhibits gastric cancer cell proliferation,
cell cycle progression, cell migration and invasion by directly
interacting with oncogenic KRAS [202] and tumor-associated
protein GRB2 [200]. MiR-433 is aberrantly expressed in myeloproliferative neoplasms and suppresses hematopoietic cell
growth and differentiation by negatively regulating GBP2
[198]. High expression of miR-433 is associated with poor
progression-free survival in patients with high-grade serous
ovarian cancer and promotes resistance to paclitaxel through
the induction of cellular senescence in ovarian cancer cells
[195]. Yang et al. demonstrates that miR-433 inhibits HCC
cell migration by repressing the protein expression and function of CREB1 [123].

Conclusions and perspectives
In this review, we briefly summarize the bidirectional interactions between CREB1 and miRNA in human cancers (Fig. 1).
We believe that, except for miR-9, other single miRNA may
also form a negative feedback loop with CREB1, which deserves further investigation. Both CREB1 and miRNA have
been shown to regulate important cancer hallmarks, including
proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, and drug resistance. A recent integrative analysis of gene and miRNA expression profiles with transcription factor-miRNA feed-forward loops
identifies CREB1 and its miRNA partners as master regulators
across multiple cancer types [203]. Given its critical roles in
cancer development and progression, the CREB1-miRNA
network (Fig. 1) may represent novel therapeutic targets in
human cancers. This network includes the important node—
CREB1 itself, the miRNAs (e.g., miR-34b, miR-200b)

8496

severing as upstream regulators of CREB1, and the CREB1
target coding genes (e.g., cyclin D1, BCL-2) and miRNAs
(e.g., miR-23a, miR-373). On one hand, miRNA target prediction and validation, including the bioinformatic databases
[204], have gain remarkable advances in recent years. We
comprehensively searched four databases of experimentally
validated miRNA target interactions (miRWalk 2.0,
miRTarBase, miRecords, and TarBase 7.0) and found that
nearly 100 miRNAs could potentially target CREB1 in human
species. Although not all information in these databases are
up-to-date or accurate, which need further improvement (see
comments of Dweep H and Kenneth Witwer that appeared in
PubMed Commons of [205]), they are still useful tools to find
putative miRNA targets in the discovery stage of investigations. On the other hand, as more and more miRNAs are
proved to be targets of transcription factor CREB1, we comment that in the future, CREB1 ChIP assays in combination
with miRNA sequencing should be helpful to identity novel
target miRNAs of CREB1. By fully understanding the regulatory networks of CREB1 and miRNA, we could be able to
evaluate the potential of CREB1 and miRNA as therapeutic
targets in human cancers.
