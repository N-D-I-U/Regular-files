Abstract

*Correspondence to:

The loss of pigmented neurons from the human brain has long been the hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Neuromelanin (NM) in the pre-synaptic terminal of dopamine neurons is emerging as a primary player in
the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders including PD. This mini-review discusses the interactions between neuromelanin and different molecules in the synaptic terminal and describes how these interactions
might affect neurodegenerative disorders including PD. Neuromelanin can reversibly bind and interact
with amine containing neurotoxins, e.g., MPTP, to augment their actions in the terminal, eventually leading
to the instability and degeneration of melanin-containing neurons due to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In particular, neuromelanin appears to confer susceptibility to chemical toxicity by
providing a large sink of iron-bound, heme-like structures in a pi-conjugated system, a system seemingly
purposed to allow for stabilizing interactions including pi-stacking as well as ligand binding to iron. Given
the progressive accumulation of NM with age corresponding with an apparent decrease in dopamine synthetic pathways, the immediate question of whether NM is also capable of binding dopamine, the primary
functional monoamine utilized in this cell, should be raised. Despite the rather glaring implications of this
finding, this idea appears not to have been adequately addressed. As such, we postulate on potential mechanisms by which dopamine might dissociate from neuromelanin and the implications of such a reversible
relationship. Intriguingly, if neuromelanin is able to sequester and release dopamine in membrane bound
vesicles, this intracellular pre-synaptic mechanism could be the basis for a form of chemical memory in dopamine neurons.

Neuromelanin: What Is It?

For over 300 years, Parkinsonism has been associated with
a loss of pigmentation from the human brain. Termed
neuromelanin (NM) to distinguish it from the numerous
melanin sources found throughout the body, it is absent at
birth and naturally increases throughout a person’s lifetime,
accelerating in synthesis and accumulation in adolescence.
This pigmentation is most pronounced in catecholaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc)
and locus coeruleus, leading to a blackened appearance in
these regions of aged brains. Loss of NM and subsequent
depigmentation of these brain regions is a hallmark feature
of Parkinson’s disease (PD). This is primarily due to immune-mediated death of pigmented cells. There is evidence
to suggest that DA neurons with high amounts of NM are
more susceptible to degeneration. For example, NM-rich
SNpc neurons undergo cell death compared to non-pigmented ventral tegmental area neurons in PD (Zecca et al.,
2003; Zucca et al., 2015).
Dopamine is normally thought to be protected from auto-oxidation in secretory vesicles through co-localization
of ascorbic acid and other antioxidants. Sulzer et al. (2000)
showed that neuromelanin forms in cultured dopaminergic neurons when cytoplasmic concentrations of dopamine
372

are artificially raised. In their experiment, PC-12 cells were
exposed to high levels of dopamine through addition of
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) to the cell culture
media, which is rapidly taken up and subsequently converted
to dopamine. Cells which had been artificially enhanced in
their ability to sequester dopamine into vesicles showed significantly less accumulation of pigment. This critical result
suggests that under the normal range of living conditions,
times exist when a firing neuron becomes over-burdened
and is unable to sequester dopamine into vesicles before
overloading the neuron’s antioxidant defenses. Such antioxidants often take the form of thiols including cysteine and
glutathione; as such, it is perhaps not surprising that natural
NM has cysteine in its pheomelanin core, while being surrounded by a eumelanin component lacking cysteine.
NM is eventually found sequestered into double membrane granules inside neurons and contains lipids and peptides bound to its structure in vivo (Zecca et al., 2000). The
finding that this structure is carefully packaged and retained
is evidence in favor of an important function for this molecule, yet we still know little about its implications for the cell.
That this pigmentation is not an enzymatically driven process in dopaminergic neurons may be highly relevant given
the lack of a central genetic basis for most cases of PD.

Structure of Endogenous NM

NM has been historically poorly characterized largely due
to the intrinsic nature of this spontaneously occurring polymer. It is structurally similar to non-neural melanins, with a
predicted 3-D lattice structure and the ability to chelate and
neutralize transition metals, ions and lipids. However, due
to the spontaneous nature of the free radical reaction that
occurs in neurons, this process is likely to be characterized
by a certain degree of lack of control. In contrast, other natural melanins found in humans are enzymatically driven, not
spontaneous. As such, the assortment of chemical precursors
of ill-defined proportion which can incorporate in addition
to dopamine and cysteine during the polymerization cascade
could also result in the lack of a consistent, regularly ordered
structure, particularly in the case of toxic chemical insult
such as that imposed by 6-hydroxydopamine. In addition,
catechol polymers are not easily de-polymerized, unlike
other macromolecules utilized in biological systems such as
polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids which can by
analyzed by relatively simple hydrolysis. Nevertheless, progress has been made in understanding the subunit makeup
of natural NM. In one study, the ratio of hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) degradation products indicated that NM is derived
mostly from dopamine, with 25% incorporation of cysteine
in the form of a benzothiazine structure. In the same study,
hydriodic acid reductive hydrolysis of NM revealed a 21%
incorporation of Cys-DA-derived units into NM, while
DOPA was found incorporated at a level near 6% for that
observed with dopamine (Wakamatsu et al., 2003).
It is now known that NM isolated from human brain is
comprised of granules with a diameter of 30 nm, similar to
that observed for Sepia cuttlefish, bovine eye, and human eye
and hair melanosomes. NM is a mixture of pheomelanin and
eumelanin, the two major forms corresponding to the widely
known light-haired and dark-haired phenotypes, respectively. Kinetic studies suggest that in such mixed pigments, pheomelanin formation occurs first with eumelanin formation
occurring only after cysteine levels have been depleted. This
leads to a predicted structural motif with pheomelanin at the
core and eumelanin at the surface (Bush et al., 2006). The
major lipid component of neuromelanin pigment derived
from human SN was found to be the polyisoprenoid dolichol, accounting for 14% of the mass of the isolated pigment
(Fedorow et al., 2005).

Chemical Binding to NM as a Causative Factor
in PD

It has also been known for several decades that a curious
feature of natural melanins is their ability to bind and retain organic compounds for long periods of times. Not
surprisingly, abundant evidence suggests that the massive
accumulation of pigment within the aged dopaminergic
neuron also corresponds with the accumulation of numerous potentially toxic chemical entities. In particular, organic
amines and metal ions such as manganese have been shown
to exhibit high binding affinities with melanins (Karlsson
and Lindquist, 2013). MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tet-

rahydropyridine) for example is believed to induce its Parkinsonian-inducing effects after first being converted to
methyl-phenyl-pyridinium ion (MPP+) by the enzyme monoamine oxidase B in nearby glial cells (Singer et al., 2006).
MPP+ appears to accumulate in pigmented neurons due to
the chelating nature of the pigmentation itself (D’Amato et al.,
1986). However, it is also thought to eventually kill the cell by
disrupting mitochondrial electron transport. Sequestration of
MPP+ then appears to induce cellular apoptosis leading to cell
death and a downstream cascading immune response due to
the release of previously unseen antigens (Sulzer et al., 2008).
Blocking the uptake of MPP+ blocks the toxic effects of MPTP
administration, yet it is unclear whether MPTP is concentrated into pigmented tissue before or after conversion to MPP+.
MPP+, apparently binds to NM in a reversible equilibria in
order to exert its known toxic effects on mitochondria.

Possible Beneficial Functions for Chemical
Binding to NM: Is There a Natural Substrate?

Many investigators have assumed that the accumulation of
NM pigment is simply an unavoidable by-product of aging.
Merely a form of molecular garbage that the cell is unable
to dispose of, they argue, thus dismissing its presence as
uninteresting and non-essential in the process. In this view,
the binding of toxic chemicals to NM may simply be a
by-product of the existence of the garbage itself, eventually
leading to the instability and death of melanin-containing
neurons due to oxidative stress. Another prevailing hypothesis for NM’s protective role in dopaminergic neurons lies
in the prevention of neurotoxic pathways of quinones that
are formed during dopamine oxidation. When dopamine is
oxidized to dopamine o-quinone, aminochrome and 5,6-indolequinone are formed and typically undergo polymerization to form the dark pigment, neuromelanin (Munoz et al.,
2012). In the absence of polymerization and neuromelanin,
aminochrome can form adducts with alpha synuclein generating neurotoxic oligomers that can trigger mitochondrial
dysfunction (Wang et al., 2012), and could induce oxidative
and endoplasmic reticulum stress thereby affecting protein
synthesis and degradation dysfunction. Alternatively, it has
been proposed that NM serves a dual function, protecting
the cell from oxidative stress through iron chelation in the
early stages, yet contributing to the autoimmune aggravation
of PD through release of novel antigens upon eventual cell
death (Zecca et al., 2006). Ultrafast laser spectroscopy studies suggest that the integrity of the pigmented granules in
tissue may play an important role in the balance between the
photo-protective and photo-damaging behaviors attributed
to melanins (Liu and Simon, 2003).
What cannot be ignored in this discussion however is the
oxidative stress necessitated by the handling of high concentrations of catecholamines. In other words, in order to function as an active dopaminergic or adrenergic cell, the cell is
necessarily at risk for toxicity from the catechols themselves,
molecules known primarily for their high reactivity and redox potential in forming quinones. As has been pointed out,
sequestration into secretory vesicles apparently alleviates this

occurring, aromatic organic catecholamines, the coordination of a lone-pair of electrons from the de-protonated
amine nitrogen to NM-chelated iron combined with potential
pi-stacking interactions through NM indole subunits provides
a plausible mechanism for observed binding interactions. The
putative ability of pigmented granules to concentrate catecholamines such as dopamine from surrounding tissue could
supplant some of the function of vesicular monoamine transporters, which serve to sequester potentially toxic dopamine
into vesicles for synaptic transmission. Such an extraordinary
ability could even supplant the function of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the enzyme primarily used to locally synthesize dopamine and which is normally used as a marker for dopaminergic neurons. In one intriguing study, the authors compared
the number of dopaminergic neurons in young, middle aged,
and older squirrel monkeys. The absolute number of these
neurons appeared to decrease over the lifespan of the animals
when anti-TH antibodies were used alone to detect their presence, yet remained constant when pigmented neurons were
counted along with TH-positive neurons (McCormack et al.,
2004). This suggests that as pigmentation accumulates in a
given neuron, TH expression is down regulated and dopamine synthesis presumably slowed.
Figure 1 Hypothetical role of Neuromelanin (NM) in the storage and
release of dopamine.
A dopaminergic axon terminal is shown, with dopamine (DA) being
synthesized and packed into vesicles via vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT) for release into the synapse. Released dopamine is
taken up through a dopamine transporter (DAT). Excess cytosolic
dopamine is thought to co-polymerize with cysteine into a polymer
of ill-defined composition which is eventually packaged into a larger
double-membrane bound vesicle (NM granule). It is known that this
pigmented granule sequesters toxins such as methyl phenyl pyridinium
ion. We hypothesize that molecular sequestration is in fact the natural
role of this pigmented granule, and that dopamine is the intended beneficiary of this uniquely reducing environment. Should a mechanism be
discovered (question mark) whereby sequestered dopamine could be
re-released upon specific triggering, this seems to provide a complete
self-reinforcing molecular memory loop. Although such a re-release
mechanism is purely speculative at this time, a number of interesting
plausible scenarios are apparent, including optical and electrical stimulation of the granule, changes in cellular pH or oxidation state, or
displacement of NM-bound dopamine by alternate catecholamines or
metal ions. We suggest that interruption of this putative sequestration
and release mechanism may underlie the molecular basis of Parkinson’s
disease initiation.

toxicity and stress on the cell. What few seem to have suggested to date however is that the accumulation of NM itself
could serves as a storage, protection, and re-release mechanism for dopamine (in the substantia nigra) or epinephrine (in
the locus coeruleus), possibly acting as a very real molecular
memory loop. This seems at first glance counter-intuitive, that
the product of oxidative stress (NM) could then function to
alleviate the very thing that created itself (excess dopamine),
yet in reality would be quite an elegant solution to a problem.
Since the structure of NM granules has not been established at sub-μm resolutions, it is not known exactly how the
polymer is arranged. However, modelling studies suggest the
granules adopt a layered structure containing a semi-regularly ordered array highly suitable for trapping monoamines
(Charkoudian and Franz, 2006). In the case of such naturally

Possible Role of NM in Neurons:
Sequestration and Release of Dopamine as a
Chemical Memory System?

Though highly speculative in nature at the current time,
such a system (illustrated in Figure 1) presents an elegant
mechanism whereby the very subunits that need protection
from oxidation result in a polymer that is capable of protecting and furthering an identical signal. If dopamine that
becomes NM is packaged into double-membrane bound vesicles in a reducing environment (as illustrated for example
by its susceptibility to Fontana-Masson silver staining) has
the ability to bind, store, protect, and release free dopamine,
the chemical loop is complete. It could explain in part the
reinforcement of addictive memories and associated behavior that comes with dopamine-releasing drugs, since excess
cytoplasmic dopamine creates oxidative stress which leads to
self-polymerization up to a certain point.
One of the strongest proposals for memory in human
brains involves synaptic plasticity, that is, the extensive
pattern of connections between the neurons can be altered through strengthening (by repeated stimulation) or
weakening (by lack of stimulation) of particular pathways.
Dopamine-binding NM structures would seem to retain a
semi-permanence despite being made of components that
are themselves susceptible to turnover. Thus it’s possible
that pigmentation in neurons could play a significant and
as yet unappreciated role in the strengthening of neuronal
connections through localized catecholamine sequestration.
Concentration of neurotransmitter into pigmented granules
would localize a pool of transmissible signal in locations
that had previously seen high dopamine release and uptake
activity. If there is then a mechanism for re-release of bound
dopamine to synaptic vesicles or to the synapse itself, the
pigmented granule could replace or assist in neurotransmis-

sion. Such a mechanism would appear to constitute a form of
molecular memory. Therefore, we believe NM represents an
obvious, if overlooked, mechanism for implicit (nondeclarative) memory which should be on the radar of many more
investigators than it is today.

Disruption of NM Function as a Predictor of
PD Inducers

If membrane bound, granular NM indeed proves to bind
dopamine in a reversible manner, we can predict that any
subsequent disruption of this function would result in symptoms of PD, analogous to what is seen in cases including
MPP+, haloperidol (HPP+), and quite possibly, 6-OH dopamine, all potent chemical inducers of Parkinson’s disease.
Given its structure, it is not surprising for example that the
6-hydroxy analogue of dopamine is taken up through dopaminergic transport mechanisms. Owing to the extra hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring, it is also much more susceptible to quinone formation than is dopamine itself, a process
believed underlying its toxic effects. To our knowledge, the
possible interaction between NM and 6-hydroxy dopamine
has not been previously explored. Manganism, which exhibits
symptoms very similar to Parkinson’s disease (Lucchini et al.,
2009), also displays a clearly plausible mechanism in this scenario through replacement of the iron normally found bound
to NM. Utilizing such a mechanism appears to have the unfortunate consequence of binding toxic agents that resemble
neurotransmitter monoamines. Such sequestration could
lead to several possible outcomes including abnormal polymerization of NM, abnormal packaging of the resulting NM
polymer, or abnormal functioning of NM granules following
successful formation. Given the commonalities between these
agents and the unique environment afforded by pigmented
neurons, we believe that chemical binding to and/or incorporation into the NM polymer itself may represent a general
mechanism for early stage chemical induction of PD.

Conclusions

Though most often associated with toxin binding, the
uniquely reducing environment of the pigmented granule
may instead provide safe harbor for endogenous catecholamines such as dopamine itself which are otherwise highly
susceptible to the oxidative stress of the cytoplasm in an
actively firing neuron. Such stabilization could supplant or
assist in the role of synaptic vesicles to form a semi-permanent connection in an elegant form of molecular memory.
Dopamine and adrenaline should be thoroughly investigated
as candidates for an endogenous NM substrate with profound implications. Preliminary evidence from our laboratory suggests that dopamine does in fact bind to a synthetic
NM polymer in a saturable manner at micromolar concentrations (Haining et al., 2016). At a minimum, the possible
influence of catecholamine binding and release by NM must
be ruled out as a contributory mechanism to dopamine storage and release if we are to understand this phenomenon
fully. Following the discovery of the role of DNA in heredity,

scientific focus has inevitably shifted toward genes and gene
products as being the most important players in the process
of life. What cannot be forgotten during this transition however is that life is driven by biochemistry at its core, not by
genes and gene products. In any case, it is becoming abundantly clear that neuromelanin is not a mere spectator in the
brain but in fact serves a very important active function.
