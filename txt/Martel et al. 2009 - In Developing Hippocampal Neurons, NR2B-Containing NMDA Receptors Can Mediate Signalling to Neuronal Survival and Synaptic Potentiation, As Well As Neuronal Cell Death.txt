Abstract
It has been suggested that NR2B-containing NMDA receptors have a selective tendency to
promote pro-death signalling and synaptic depression, compared to the survival promoting,
synapse potentiating properties of NR2A-containing NMDA receptors. A preferential localization
of NR2A-containing NMDA receptors at the synapse in maturing neurons could thus explain
differences in synaptic vs. extrasynaptic NMDA receptor signalling.

We have investigated whether NMDA receptors can mediate signalling to survival, death, and
synaptic potentiation, in neurons at a developmental stage prior to significant NR2A expression
and subunit-specific differences between synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. We show
that in developing hippocampal neurons, the progressive reduction in sensitivity of NMDA
receptor currents to the NR2B antagonist ifenprodil applies to both synaptic and extrasynaptic
locations. However, the reduction is less acute in extrasynaptic currents, indicating that NR2A
does partition preferentially, but not exclusively, into synaptic locations at DIV>12. We then
studied NMDA receptor signalling at DIV10, when both synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA
receptors are both overwhelmingly and equally NR2B-dominated. To analyse pro-survival
signalling we studied the influence of synaptic NMDA receptor activity on staurosporine-induced
apoptosis. Blockade of spontaneous NMDAR activity with MK-801, or ifenprodil exacerbated the
apoptotic insult. Furthermore, MK-801 and ifenprodil both antagonized neuroprotection promoted
by enhancing synaptic activity. Pro-death signalling induced by a toxic dose of NMDA is also
blocked by NR2B-specific antagonists. Using a cell culture model of synaptic NMDA receptordependent synaptic potentiation, we find that this is mediated exclusively by NR2B-containing
NMDARs, as implicated by NR2B-specific antagonists and the use of selective vs. non-selective
doses of the NR2A-preferring antagonist NVP-AAM077.
Therefore, within a single neuron, NR2B-NMDA receptors are able to mediate both survival and
death signalling, as well as model of NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic potentiation. In this
instance, subunit differences cannot account for the dichotomous nature of NMDA receptor
signalling.

Introduction

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

NMDARs (N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors) are ionotropic receptors gated by the
neurotransmitter glutamate, that play an important role in the physiology and
pathophysiology of the central nervous system (CNS) (Waxman and Lynch, 2005). Most
NMDARs in the mammalian CNS are comprised of two NR1 subunits and two NR2
subunits. There are four types of NR2 subunit (NR2A-D) which contain the binding site for
glutamate, confer on the NMDAR distinct biophysical and pharmacological properties and
potentially their ability to interact with different intracellular signalling molecules (CullCandy and Leszkiewicz, 2004, Erreger et al., 2004, Chen and Wyllie, 2006, Kohr, 2006).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

NMDAR activity has the potential to promote survival or death in CNS neurons (Papadia
and Hardingham, 2007). The magnitude of activation, be it intensity or duration, is very
important in determining the nature of the response to an episode of NMDAR activity. The
classical bell-shaped curve model of the neuronal response to NMDA or glutamate contends
that intermediate, physiological levels of NMDAR activity are necessary for neuroprotection
whereas too little or too much NMDAR activity promotes cell death or vulnerability to
trauma (Lipton and Nakanishi, 1999). Aside from stimulus intensity, the location of the
NMDAR may also profoundly affect the signals that emanate from the NMDAR.
Developing neurons have sizeable pools of NMDARs at extrasynaptic, as well as synaptic
locations, which signal very differently. Ca2+ influx that is dependent on intense synaptic
NMDAR activation is well tolerated by cells whereas activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs,
either on their own or accompanied by synaptic NMDAR activation, causes a loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential and cell death (Hardingham et al., 2002, Leveille et al.,
2005, Zhang et al., 2007). Differential synaptic vs. extrasynaptic NMDAR effects also
extend to other signal pathways. While synaptic NMDAR activity strongly induces CREBdependent gene expression, extrasynaptic NMDARs are coupled to a CREB shut-off
pathway (Hardingham et al., 2002) in a developmentally regulated manner (Hardingham and
Bading, 2002). It has also been shown that there is opposing regulation of the ERK1/2
pathway by synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs in hippocampal neurons: Synaptic
NMDARs activate the ERK pathway whereas extrasynaptic NMDARs evoke ERK
inactivation (Ivanov et al., 2006). Extrasynaptic NMDARs have also been implicated
specifically in promoting long term depression while synaptic NMDARs are responsible for
long term potentiation (Massey et al., 2004).
The differences in synaptic vs. extrasynaptic signalling could be conceivably down to three
factors. Firstly, synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs could be coupled to different
signalling pathways, either physically or functionally due to their location. Secondly,
differences in signalling could be due to the way in which these distinct pools are activated:
brief saturating activation by trans-synaptic glutamate release (synaptic NMDARs) vs.
chronic low level activation by bath/ambient glutamate (extrasynaptic NMDARs). Thirdly,
differences could be a by-product of differences in the location of NR2B vs. NR2Acontaining NMDARs (NR2A-NMDARs). NR2A expression in the rodent CNS begins 6-10
days post-natally (Sheng et al., 1994, Zhong et al., 1994). NR2A becomes incorporated into
synaptic NMDARs, by a mechanism involving the cytoplasmic C-terminus (Steigerwald et
al., 2000), (but see (Thomas et al., 2006)). NR2A may thus become enriched at synapses
compared to extrasynaptic locations. Liu et al. reported that NR2A-containing NMDARs
promote survival and NR2B-NMDARs promote death independent of their location (Liu et
al., 2007). Therefore, synaptic NMDARs may selectively promote survival due to the fact
that they are enriched in NR2A-NMDARs. However, von Engelhardt et al. found that prodeath NMDAR signalling can be mediated by NR2A-NMDARs (von Engelhardt et al.,
2007), indicating that the subunit is not important in determining excitotoxicity. Moreover,
the concept that NR2A partitions near-exclusively into synaptic locations has been

challenged recently by findings that NR2A can end up at extrasynaptic locations in cultured
neurons (Thomas et al., 2006) and that the subunit compositions of synaptic and
extrasynaptic NMDARs are similar in 3 week old acute hippocampal slices (Harris and
Pettit, 2007).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The concept of NR2 subunit-specific signalling also an ongoing area of interest within the
synaptic plasticity field. It has been proposed that NR2A-containing NMDARs are
preferentially involved in potentiation of synapses, while NR2B-containing NMDARs play a
role principally in depression (Liu et al., 2004, Massey et al., 2004, Bartlett et al., 2007).
However, this is controversial: other studies have claimed that NR2A-containing NMDARs
are not essential for induction of NMDAR-dependent LTP, and that NR2B-containing
NMDARs can mediate it equally well (Berberich et al., 2005, Weitlauf et al., 2005, Zhao et
al., 2005, Berberich et al., 2007, Le Roux et al., 2007).
In this study we have assessed the capacity of the NMDAR to support dichotomous survival/
death signalling as well as synaptic potentiation in hippocampal neurons at a developmental
stage (DIV7-11) where NR2A expression is a very minor component of either synaptic or
extrasynaptic NMDARs. We find that NR2B-NMDARs can mediate both excitotoxic effects
as well as pro-survival synaptic NMDARs signalling. Moreover, NR2B-NMDARs mediate
synaptic NMDAR-dependent changes in a model of synaptic potentiation. Thus, synaptic
potentiation can be mediated solely by NR2B-NMDARs, and dichotomous NMDAR
signalling to survival/death exists in hippocampal neurons at a developmental stage where
subunit differences cannot offer an explanation.

Experimental procedures
Hippocampal cultures, stimulation, and the induction of apoptosis/necrosis

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Hippocampal neurons were cultured as described (Bading and Greenberg, 1991) except that
growth medium was supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen). All experiments were performed
after a culturing period of >7 days during by which time hippocampal neurons have
developed a rich network of processes, express functional NMDA-type and AMPA/kainatetype glutamate receptors, and form synaptic contacts (Hardingham et al., 2001, Hardingham
and Bading, 2002, Hardingham et al., 2002). Prior to the stimulation of neurons or the
addition of excitotoxic doses of NMDA or apoptosis inducers, neurons were placed in a nontrophic medium by transferring them from growth medium to a medium containing 10%
MEM (Invitrogen), 90% Salt-Glucose-Glycine (SGG) medium ((Bading et al., 1993), SGG:
114 mM NaCl, 0.219 % NaHCO3, 5.292 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM
HEPES, 1 mM glycine, 30 mM glucose, 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 % Phenol Red;
osmolarity 325mosm/l). Bursts of action potential firing were induced by treatment of
cultured hippocampal neurons with 50 μM bicuculline; bursts are associated with NMDARdependent intracellular Ca2+ transients (Hardingham et al., 2001). For inducing excitotoxic
cell death, neurons were exposed to NMDA (50 μM) in our standard trophically deprived
medium (see above) for 1 hr, after which neurons were washed once and returned to fresh
medium. Neurons that die in response to exposure to excitotoxic levels of glutamate exhibit
swollen cell bodies and pyknotic nuclei with small irregular chromatin clumps, a
characteristic of necrotic cell death as opposed to apoptotic-like death ((Fujikawa et al.,
2000), see (Hardingham et al., 2002) for example pictures). Cell death was determined 24 h
later by counting the number of DAPI-stained pyknotic nuclei as a percentage of the total.
Staurosporine exposure (24 h) was also used to induce apoptosis (50-100 nM).
Morphologically, trophically-deprived and staurosporine-treated neurons show typical signs
of apoptotic-like cell death (shrunken cell body and large round chromatin clumps).
Staurosporine activates caspases and death is blocked by pan-caspase inhibitors

Electrophysiological recording and analysis
Coverslips containing hippocampal neurons were transferred to a recording chamber
perfused with an external recording solution composed of (in mM): 152 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 10
HEPES, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 0.1 glycine and 0.02 strychnine, pH 7.3 (320-330 mOsm).
Patch pipettes were made from thick-walled borosilicate glass (Harvard Apparatus, Kent,
UK) and filled with a K-gluconate-based internal solution containing (in mM): 155 Kgluconate, 2 MgCl2, 10 Na-HEPES, 10 Na-PiCreatine, 2 Mg2-ATP and 0.3 Na3-GTP, pH
7.3 (300 mOsm). Electrode tips were fire-polished for a final resistance ranging between
5-10 MΩ. For experiments requiring a high signal-to-noise ratio, electrodes were coated with
Sylgard 184 resin (Dow Corning, Midland, MI). Currents were recorded at room
temperature (21 ± 2°C) using an Axopatch-1C amplifier (Molecular Device, Union City,
CA) and stored on digital audio tape. Data was subsequently digitized and analyzed using
WinEDR v6.1 software (John Dempster, University of Strathclyde, UK). Hippocampal
neurons were voltage-clamped at -70 mV, and recordings were rejected if the holding
current was greater than -100 pA or if the series resistance drifted by more than 20% of its
initial value (<35 MΩ).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Whole-cell NMDAR-mediated currents were measured in external recording solution
supplemented with 0.3 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 50 μM picrotoxin (PTX, both from
Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), flowing in the recording chamber at a rate of 3-5 ml/min.
NMDAR-mediated currents were elicited by switching from the external recording solution
line to one containing 150 μM NMDA for 5-10 sec, until the current reached a steady-state,
then back to the agonist-free solution. Because cells were difficult to maintain after too
many agonist applications, each NMDA application was followed by at least 1 min washout
and limited to 2-3 repeats. NMDAR antagonists NVP-AAM077 and ifenprodil (Tocris
Bioscience or Merck) were bath-applied for 3 min before current measurements. All currents
were normalized to their respective initial whole-cell agonist-elicited current and are shown
in percentage of basal. Applying increasing concentrations of NVP-AAM077 to inhibit of
glutamate (3 mM) evoked currents allowed us to determine an IC50 value for NVPAAM077 (Frizelle et al., 2006). For these experiments the external recording solution was
supplemented with CNQX (10 mM) to block glutamate-evoked activation of AMPA and
kainate receptors.
Analysis of extrasynaptic NMDAR currents
To block synaptically located NMDARs, we used a quantal activation-mediated blockade by
MK-801 (Nakayama et al., 2005). In Mg2+-free external recording solution containing TTX,
release of glutamate into the synaptic cleft can occur only via spontaneous (action potential
independent) release of synaptic vesicles (packets) of glutamate. In the added presence of
MK-801, an irreversible (in our experimental time-frame) open-channel blocker MK-801,
only the NMDARs experiencing this localized release, therefore defined as “synaptic”, were
antagonized by MK-801. Following MK-801 application to allow sufficient block of
synaptic NMDARs and a 3 min washout of MK-801, only extrasynaptic NMDAR
contributed to subsequent whole-cell NMDAR-mediated currents. When using ifenprodil,
because of the difficult washout of the drug and the possibility that it might cause an
underestimation of the NR2B-containing synaptic NMDAR population, the drug was never

applied before the quantal block protocol. Thus, ifenprodil sensitivity of “whole-cell” and
“extrasynaptic” fractions was compared in an unpaired manner. The extrasynaptic NMDA
currents measured were normalized to their pre-MK-801 currents and are shown as
percentage of basal.
Model of NMDAR-dependent synaptic potentiation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To potentiate miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) frequency, 50 μM
bicuculline was added to culture medium for 15 min, which was then replaced with drugfree medium for approximately 1 h before electrophysiological recordings. By adding
GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline, tonic inhibition on the neuronal network is
relieved, inducing synchronous bursting of neurons which triggers a long-lasting increase in
mEPSC frequency, likely due to conversion of silent synapses into functional ones (Arnold
et al., 2005). Following the waiting period, hippocampal neurons were transferred into the
recording chamber filled with an external recording solution composed of (in mM): 150
NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 and 10 glucose, pH 7.3 (320-330 mOsm)..
mEPSCs were recorded for 5-10 min (minimum of 200 events) from neurons clamped at
−70 mV. Data was analyzed offline with MiniAnalysis software (Synaptosoft, Fort Lee, NJ)
as described (Baxter and Wyllie, 2006). mEPSCs were manually selected with a minimum
amplitude threshold of 6 pA (approximately 2 times the baseline noise level). For the
experiments using NMDAR antagonists, drugs were pre-applied 20 min before the
bicuculline stimulation.

Results
DIV 12-18 hippocampal neurons contain a lower proportion of NR2B-NMDARs than DIV
7-11 neurons

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We first investigated the sensitivity of glutamate-evoked whole-cell NMDAR currents to the
NR2B-selective antagonist ifenprodil (Williams, 1993) at different developmental stages. As
expected, we observed a large increase in the magnitude of NMDAR currents as the neurons
progress through in vitro development (data not shown). However, the sensitivity of this
current to ifenprodil remains very high with currents being blocked by 74 ± 2 % (n=21) up
to DIV11 (Fig. 1a,b). Ifenprodil is an incomplete antagonist: it blocks pure NR1/NR2B
NMDARs by approximately 80 % (Williams, 1993, Tovar and Westbrook, 1999, Frizelle et
al., 2006) and so the degree of blockade that we see here is indicative of a near-pure
population of NR2B-NMDARs. To confirm this further we determined the sensitivity of our
whole-cell currents to the competitive NMDAR antagonist NVP-AAM077 (Auberson et al.,
2002, Liu et al., 2004). In recombinant NR2A- or NR2B-containing NMDARs this
antagonist blocks glutamate-evoked currents with IC50 values of 31 nM and 215 nM
respectively (Frizelle et al., 2006) when glutamate is used at its EC50 concentration for each
NMDAR subtype (see (Wyllie and Chen, 2007) for a discussion of this point). We find that
at DIV 7-11 NMDAR-mediated currents evoked by glutamate at its EC50 concentration (3
mM) are blocked (Fig. 1c) in a manner that is consistent with a near pure NR2B-NMDAR
population with the IC50 for NVP-AAM077 block being 203 nM (Fig. 1d). In agreement
with previous studies (Kew et al., 1998, Tovar and Westbrook, 1999) ifenprodil sensitivity
of NMDAR currents is lower in older neurons: sensitivity is only around 50% in DIV12-18
neurons (Fig. 1a,b), indicative of increased expression of ifenprodil-insensitive NR2ANMDARs.
Developmental loss of ifenprodil sensitivity of NMDAR currents is not solely restricted to
synaptic locations
We next sought to determine whether this loss of ifenprodil sensitivity applied equally to
synaptic and extrasynaptic currents, or whether extrasynaptic currents remained essentially

NR2B-containing. This would tell us whether NR2A was partitioning selectively into
synaptic locations. To analyze extrasynaptic NMDAR currents we used an established
method for selectively and irreversibly blocking synaptic NMDARs (Nakayama et al., 2005)
whereupon bath application of agonist is then used to activate extrasynaptic NMDARs.
Following the measurement of whole-cell NMDAR currents, neurons were placed in TTX
and Mg2+-free solution, in the presence of MK-801. Under these conditions, spontaneous
release of quanta of glutamate activate synaptic NMDARs, which are then blocked by the
open channel blocker MK-801. Comparing NMDAR currents before and after this treatment
revealed that open-channel NMDAR blockade under spontaneous quantal neurotransmitter
release is progressive, plateaus after 10 min and goes no further (Fig. 2a,b). This remaining
current, undiminished by this protocol for blocking synaptic NMDARs, is extrasynaptic. To
demonstrate conclusively that all synaptic NMDARs are blocked by this protocol we
analyzed the shape of mEPSCs before and after MK-801 blockade of NMDARs that had
been activated by spontaneous quantal neurotransmitter release (see methods). There is a
clear change in the decay kinetics, indicative of a loss of the NMDAR component of the
current (Fig. 2c,d). To confirm that this loss is complete, we compared the kinetics of these
mEPSCs with those where all NMDARs are blocked by a high agonist application (100 μM
NMDA) in the presence of MK-801. Under these conditions, the mEPSC kinetics are
identical to those subjected to NMDAR blockade under spontaneous quantal release for 10
min (Fig. 2c), showing that all synaptic NMDARs are indeed blocked.
Not surprisingly we found that at DIV7-11, ifenprodil exerted a near-maximal block on
extrasynaptic currents (77 ± 2 %, n=18), just as it did to whole-cell currents (Fig. 2e). At
DIV12-18, however, the blockade of extrasynaptic NMDAR currents was significantly
lower (65 ± 3 %, n=16, p < 0.01 Fig. 2e), indicating that some NR2A-NMDARs are
incorporated into extrasynaptic sites, as has been shown previously (Thomas et al., 2006).
Importantly, however, the ifenprodil sensitivity of extrasynaptic NMDAR currents was still
significantly greater than the sensitivity of whole-cell currents (Fig. 2e), indicating that
NR2A-NMDARs are preferentially incorporated into synaptic sites.
NR2B-NMDARs can mediate both pro-death and pro-survival NMDAR signalling

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Given that both synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR currents at DIV7-11 are essentially
NR2B-NMDAR-mediated, we wanted to determine whether NR2B-NMDARs were able to
mediate both survival and death signalling within a single neuronal type. Experiments were
carried out at DIV8-11. We first looked at pro-death signalling from the NMDAR, induced
by the bath application of a toxic dose of NMDA (50 μM). Both MK-801 and ifenprodil
prevented excitotoxic cell death (Fig. 3a,b). Furthermore, we tested the effect of NR2Aantagonizing levels of NVP-AAM077 (30 nM) which inhibits approximately 70 % of
NR2A-mediated currents and 10 % NR2B-mediated currents evoked by 50 μM NMDA
(Frizelle et al., 2006). 30 nM NVP-AAM077 did not impact on cell death. However, a
concentration that inhibits over 70 % of NR2B-mediated currents in addition to NR2Acontaining NMDARs (400 nM, (Frizelle et al., 2006)) was neuroprotective (Fig. 3a,b). We
next sought to determine whether synaptic NMDAR-dependent neuroprotection is
achievable in DIV9 hippocampal neurons, and whether it is mediated by NR2B--NMDARs.
We then used the established model of staurosporine-induced apoptosis and assessed the
influence of synaptic NMDAR activity on vulnerability to this insult. We found that
blockade of spontaneous NMDAR activity with MK-801 and NR2B-NMDAR activity with
ifenprodil exacerbated staurosporine-induced neuronal death (Fig. 4a). Thus, spontaneous
NR2B-NMDAR activity is clearly exerting a protective effect in this model of cell death. In
addition to inhibiting spontaneous NMDAR activity with antagonists, synaptic NMDAR
activity can be enhanced by dis-inhibiting the neuronal network. Synaptic activity was
initiated by treating rat cortical neurons with the GABAA receptor blocker bicuculline

(Hardingham et al., 2001). This stimulation protocol induces bursts of action potentials
which are associated with NMDAR-dependent Ca2+ transients (Hardingham and Bading,
2002). This enhanced activity promotes strong protection in the face of the apoptotic insult
(Fig. 4b,c) and moreover both MK-801 and ifenprodil reduce the protection afforded. Note
that bicuculline treatment still has a small protective effect in the presence of ifenprodil (Fig.
4b), potentially due to the fact that it does not block NR2B-NMDARs completely. In
conclusion, NR2B-NMDARs are able to signal to neuroprotection as well as neuronal death.
NR2B-NMDARs can mediate synaptic activity-dependent potentiation of mEPSC frequency
It has been suggested that NR2B-NMDARs couple selectively to synaptic depression, and
not potentiation (Liu et al., 2004, Massey et al., 2004). We wanted to determine whether
NMDAR-dependent synaptic potentiation was achievable in our cultures at this
developmental stage. We employed a model of plasticity (Arnold et al., 2005) in which a
brief period of bicuculline-induced bursting causes an NMDAR-dependent increase in
mEPSC frequency, attributed to AMPA receptor insertion and unsilencing of synapses (Lu
et al., 2001, Abegg et al., 2004, Baxter and Wyllie, 2006). We found that this model of
potentiation is very robust in DIV 8-11 hippocampal neurons (Fig. 5a,b). Moreover,
MK-801 and ifenprodil blocked the increase in mEPSC frequency, demonstrating that this
potentiation process is NR2B-dependent (Fig. 5a,b). In addition, a concentration of NVPAAM077 (30 nM) predicted to impair activation of synaptic NR2A-NMDARs but not
NR2B-NMDARs (Frizelle et al., 2006) failed to block potentiation, while a nondiscriminating concentration (400 nM) did block potentiation (Fig. 5a,b).

Discussion
We have shown that in developing hippocampal neurons, NR2B-NMDARs are capable of
mediating antagonistic signalling to survival/death as well as synaptic potentiation,
depending on the stimulus employed. This indicates that in immature hippocampal neurons
at least, the subunit composition of the NMDAR cannot account for dichotomous NMDAR
signalling.

Signalling to survival and death by the NMDAR
Despite an overwhelming body of evidence from animal studies implicating NMDAR
activity in neuronal loss following ischemia, the many clinical trials of different NMDAR
antagonists for stroke have failed due to poor tolerance and efficacy (Ikonomidou and
Turski, 2002, Muir, 2006). The fact that the NMDAR plays a central role in synaptic
plasticity and transmission, and learning and cognition accounts for the undesired
psychomimetic and CNS-adverse effects of antagonists (Muir, 2006). However, trial design
may have been erring too far on the side of caution in seeking to avoid psychosis and other
CNS-adverse effects, when these side-effects are on-target and not off-target effects. Other
issues cloud a clear assessment of NMDAR antagonists, such as numbers of patients within
the trials and time taken to administrate the drug. With many large pharmaceutical
companies having shied away from NMDAR antagonists, these issues may not be resolved
any time soon.
Nevertheless, the growing body of evidence that physiological synaptic NMDAR activity
exerts a neuroprotective effect (Ikonomidou and Turski, 2002, Hardingham and Bading,
2003, Hetman and Kharebava, 2006) has led to suggestions that it may play a role in
promoting recovery and preventing delayed neuronal loss in the penumbra (Albers et al.,
2001, Ikonomidou and Turski, 2002). Thus, global NMDAR antagonists may block
NMDAR-activated pro-death signals triggered in response to an ischemic challenge, but
interfere with some recovery or preconditioning processes in the penumbra. The anti-

excitotoxic effects of NMDAR antagonists have never been in question, but until relatively
recently the pro-survival role of the NMDAR was not known and so antagonists were not
tested in contexts that would expose their harmful effects. In treating disorders associated
with pro-death NMDAR signalling, it may be desirable to block pro-death signalling,
without affecting pro-survival signalling or synaptic plasticity.

A specific role for NR2B-NMDARs in promoting cell death would enable this particular
subtype of NMDAR to be targeted without impairing pro-survival signalling, using the
highly selective antagonists available. However, our observations suggest that NR2BNMDARs are capable of promoting both survival and death signalling. Moreover, in more
mature neurons (DIV21) NR2A-NMDARs were recently shown to be capable of mediating
excitotoxicity as well as protective signalling (von Engelhardt et al., 2007). Taken together,
these studies indicate that NR2B-NMDARs and NR2A-NMDARs are both capable of
mediating survival and death signalling. Thus, the specific ability of NR2B-NMDARs and
NR2A-NMDARs to promote death and survival respectively as described recently (Liu et
al., 2007) may not apply in all neuronal types at all developmental stages, and so NR2Bspecific antagonism may not be an optimal anti-excitotoxic strategy. Furthermore, the recent
observation that synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs have similar NR2B components in 3
week old acute hippocampal slices (Harris and Pettit, 2007) suggests that NR2B-selective
antagonists may not be successful even in selectively targetting extrasynaptic NMDARs in
vivo. An added complication is the fact that ifenprodil and related NR2B antagonists
actually potentiate NR2B-NMDAR currents when agonist concentrations are low, and so
may boost extrasynaptic currents under conditions of low-to-modest ambient glutamate
(Neyton and Paoletti, 2006). Another pharmacological approach to sparing trans-synaptic
NMDAR signalling while blocking the effects of excitotoxic doses of elevated glutamate in
the extracellular medium could involve low-affinity uncompetitive antagonists such as
memantine. Its uncompetitive nature results in very effective blockade of excessive chronic
NMDAR activity caused by high ambient levels of glutamate or NMDA (Chen and Lipton,
2006). However, due to its fast off rate, memantine will not substantially interfere with
normal synaptic NMDAR activity by accumulating in the channel (Chen et al., 1998, Chen
and Lipton, 2006, Wrighton et al., 2007), in contrast to MK-801, which is a uncompetitive
antagonist/open channel blocker with an extremely slow off-rate. As a drug that antagonizes
the NMDAR preferentially under pathological rather than physiological scenarios, it has the
advantage of potentially protecting all neurons regardless of the subunit composition of their
NMDARs.
Subunit-dependence of the directionality of synaptic plasticity?
The NR2 composition of the NMDAR may play an important role in the directionality of
synaptic plasticity. It has been proposed that NR2A-containing NMDARs are preferentially
involved in potentiation of synapses, while NR2B-containing NMDARs play a role mainly
in depression (Liu et al., 2004, Massey et al., 2004, Bartlett et al., 2007). However, other
studies have claimed that NR2A-containing NMDARs are not essential for induction of
NMDAR-dependent LTP, and that NR2B-containing NMDARs can mediate it equally well
(Berberich et al., 2005, Weitlauf et al., 2005, Zhao et al., 2005, Berberich et al., 2007, Le
Roux et al., 2007).
One potential reason for this controversy lies in the use of NVP-AAM077 which has been
reported to selectively block NR2A-NMDARs (Auberson et al., 2002) and which has
resulted in it being used to implicate NR2A-NMDARs in various processes. However, later
studies have shown this antagonist to be less select than originally thought (Berberich et al.,
2005, Frizelle et al., 2006, Neyton and Paoletti, 2006). Moreover NVP-AAM077 was shown
to inhibit NMDAR-dependent LTP even in NR2A -/- mice and attenuate NMDAR currents
mediated by NR2B-containing receptors in neurons (Weitlauf et al., 2005). Indeed at the

concentrations most commonly used (300 – 400 nM) NVP-AAM077 will block,
substantially, synaptic activation of both NR2A- and NR2B containing NMDARs since its
slow dissociation rate constant will mean that on a synaptic timescale glutamate and NVPAAM077 binding cannot reach equilibrium (Frizelle et al., 2006, Wyllie and Chen, 2007).
Nevertheless, application of low concentrations (30 nM or less) can be used to provide some
NR2A-selective antagonism and implicate NR2A specifically in synaptic potentiation
(Frizelle et al., 2006, Bartlett et al., 2007).
Another potential reason for disagreement lies in the fact that the expression of NR2A is
developmentally regulated, starting around P6-P10 (Sheng et al., 1994, Zhong et al., 1994).
NR2A subunits contribute increasingly to synaptic NMDAR currents (Stocca and Vicini,
1998, Tovar and Westbrook, 1999) and so the developmental stage could have a significant
bearing on the involvement of NR2A- vs. NR2B-NMDARs in a process (e.g. LTP)
independently of any subunit-specific signalling requirements (e.g. see (Le Roux et al.,
2007)). Our studies indicate that in immature hippocampal cultures, NR2B-NMDARs are
capable of mediating activity-dependent potentiation of synaptic connections, as measured
by analysing mEPSC frequency.
Pattern of NMDA receptor activity vs subtype of NMDA receptor?

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

In this study we show that when bicuculline-induced AP bursting activates NR2B-NMDARs
trans-synaptically, neuroprotective signalling is induced, as is synaptic potentiation. In
contrast, extended bath-activation of all (synaptic and extrasynaptic) NMDARs promotes
cell death, also via NR2B-NMDAR activation. Furthermore, we find that brief bath
application of NMDA triggers synaptic depression: spontaneous mEPSC frequency is
lowered 30 min after brief NMDA exposure (30 μM for 4 min, Martel, Wyllie and
Hardingham, unpublished observations). The opposing effects of bath activating all
(synaptic and extrasynaptic) NMDARs and trans-synaptically activating synaptic NMDARs
is evident in neurons expressing essentially only NR2B-NMDARs. This demonstrates that in
this particular instance, consequences of NMDAR signalling is determined by the type of
stimulus, and not the subunit composition. Quite what it is about the stimuli which trigger
the different effects is not addressed here, but previous work has demonstrated a dominant
effect of extrasynaptic NMDARs in promoting neuronal death (Hardingham et al., 2002)
and synaptic depression (Massey et al., 2004), which would explain the observations in this
study. It will be interesting to see how synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs are coupled to
different signalling pathways. It could be that they are coupled differently (either physically/
functionally) as a result of their differing location. Another contributing factor could be the
way in which these distinct pools are activated: brief saturating activation in the case of
trans-synaptic activation of synaptic NMDARs vs. chronic low level activation of
extrasynaptic NMDARs by bath/ambient glutamate. Differences in the properties of
intracellular Ca2+ transients evoked by these different stimuli could differentially affect
signalling, even if the overall Ca2+ load were similar.
