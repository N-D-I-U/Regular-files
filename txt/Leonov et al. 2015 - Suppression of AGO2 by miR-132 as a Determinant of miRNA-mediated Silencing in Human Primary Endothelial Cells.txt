The abundance of miR-132 ranges from constitutively high in the brain where it is necessary for neuronal development and function, to inducible expression in haematopoietic and endothelial cells where
it controls angiogenesis and immune activation. We show that expression of AGO2, a protein central to
miRNA-mediated gene silencing and miRNA biogenesis, is negatively regulated by miR-132. Using HeLa
cells, we demonstrate that miR-132 interacts with the AGO2 mRNA 3 UTR and suppresses AGO2 expression and AGO2-dependent small RNA-mediated silencing. Similarly, miR-132 over-expression leads to
AGO2 suppression in primary human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs). During phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-activation of HDLECs, miR-132 is induced in a CREB-dependent manner and inhibition
of miR-132 results in increased AGO2 expression. In agreement with the role of AGO2 in maintenance
of miRNA expression, AGO2 suppression by miR-132 affects the steady state levels of miR-221 and miR146a, two miRNAs involved in angiogenesis and inﬂammation, respectively. Our data demonstrate that
the miRNA-silencing machinery is subject to autoregulation during primary cell activation through direct
suppression of AGO2 by miR-132.

1. Introduction
The mature miR-132 (miR-132-3p) is derived from the primary miR-132/miR-212 cluster, found in the intergenic region of
chromosome 17p13.3. miR-132 and miR-212 have the same seed
sequence and potential targets, although miR-132 is the preferentially expressed miRNA from the cluster (Lagos et al., 2010).
The transcription of miR-132/miR-212 cluster is dependent on
cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein phosphorylation
(Vo et al., 2005), which is inducible in an ERK-1/2 and MSK-1/2
dependent manner (Remenyi et al., 2010). miR-132 has been implicated in neuronal function and development (Remenyi et al., 2010;
Wayman et al., 2008), circadian rhythm control (Alvarez-Saavedra
et al., 2011), angiogenesis (Anand et al., 2010), and regulation of
innate immune responses (Lagos et al., 2010; Shaked et al., 2009). In
endothelial cells, upregulation of miR-132 positively controls proliferation, angiogenesis and tumour growth in response to vascular
endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) by suppressing p120RasGap

(RASA1) (Anand et al., 2010). During viral infection of human cells
in vitro, miR-132 acts as a negative regulator of inﬂammation in
endothelial cells and macrophages by modulating EP300 (Lagos
et al., 2010). Interestingly, EP300 is a co-transcriptional activator
that is required for miR-132 expression, which may contribute to
the transient expression of this miRNA, as seen in endothelial cells.
Although the expression of miR-132 is low under basal conditions
in HDLECs (approximately 50–100 copies per cell), endothelial
activation leads to an early upregulation of miR-132 required for
endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis (Anand et al., 2010;
Lagos et al., 2010).
The abundance of mature miRNAs can be regulated at multiple
steps of miRNA biogenesis by altering the expression or function
of miRNA machinery proteins. The knock-down of DICER (Zhang
et al., 2012; Schmitter et al., 2006) or AGO2 (Schmitter et al., 2006)
has been correlated with a global drop of mature miRNA expression levels. DICER (Bernstein et al., 2003) and AGO2 (Morita et al.,
2007) knock-out mice are embryonic lethal and this demonstrates
the importance of miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression
during the early stages of embryo development. Reversely, the
upregulation of AGO2 has been associated with a global increased
expression of miRNAs (Martinez and Gregory, 2013; Winter and

Diederichs, 2011). Global changes in miRNA expression levels lead
to disruptions in cellular function, such as poor neovascularisation and vascular deformation reported in DICER knock-out mice
(Bernstein et al., 2003).
The very nature of miRNA-mediated gene regulation means that
the formation of negative feedback regulatory loops can occur,

where a miRNA can be involved in regulating its own biogenesis by targeting components required for its speciﬁc transcription,
post-transcriptional processing, stability, or target accessibility.
In the context of miRNA biogenesis, such regulatory loops have
been identiﬁed in the regulation of DICER by let-7 in mammalian
cell lines (Tokumaru et al., 2008), AGO1 regulation by miR-168

G. Leonov et al. / The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology 69 (2015) 75–84

in plants (Martínez de Alba et al., 2011), and ALG-1 regulation
by let-7 in Caenorhabditis elegans (Zisoulis et al., 2012). The regulation of mammalian AGO2 by miR-184 has also been reported
during cytokine stimulation (Roberts et al., 2013), and reported in
response to insulin stimulation and thereby controlling cell proliferation (Tattikota et al., 2014). Of note, AGO2 is the only catalytically
active mammalian Argonaute family protein (Meister et al., 2004),
making it essential for mRNA cleavage and effective in both siRNA
and miRNA-mediated silencing.
Here, we identify an autoregulatory feedback mechanism that
involves AGO2 suppression by miR-132. We have examined this
mechanism in both transformed cell lines and activated primary
human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLECs). We demonstrate that changes in AGO2 expression affect expression of speciﬁc
HDLEC miRNAs, such as miR-221 and miR-146a, which have important and critical roles in angiogenesis and inﬂammation (Li et al.,
2009; Poliseno et al., 2006; Taganov et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2012).
Overall, our ﬁndings reveal a novel mechanism regulating AGO2
expression and provide mechanistic insight into the function of
miR-132 in human primary endothelial cells.

2. Methods
2.1. Cell culture
Human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells (HDLEC) were purchased from Promocell and grown in endothelial cell growth
medium (Promocell) supplemented with 10 ng/mL VEGF-C (R&D).
All HDLEC experiments were performed at passage 5. HDLECs
(passage 5) fully maintain their proliferative capacity and differentiation markers (Hansen et al., 2010; Lagos et al., 2010), including
LYVE1 (Supplementary Fig. 1). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% FCS.
2.2. Transfections with miRNA mimics and inhibitors, and RNA
inhibitors
Cells were transfected in 6-well plates in Opti-MEM using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) transfection reagent 18 h after seeding. The
siRNAs (OnTargetPlus SmartPool from Thermo Scientiﬁc), miRNA
mimics (miRIDIAN from Thermo Scientiﬁc) were prepared at 25 nM
concentration and Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA)-inhibitors of miR132 (Exiqon) were prepared at 50 nM concentration. Cells were
harvested 48 h post transfection.
2.3. Lentiviral transduction
The miR-132/miR-212 cluster or AGO2-UTR were ampliﬁed
from genomic DNA or cDNA respectively and subcloned into
the pSIN lentiviral vector using the NotI and BamHI restriction
enzymes. For lentiviral transduction, virions were produced as
described in (Lagos et al., 2008). HDLECs were infected for 48 h
before harvesting.
2.4. PMA treatment
HDLECs were activated with PMA for 24 h before harvesting.
PMA treatments were carried out 18 h after seeding cells into 6-well
plates, 48 h after miRNA inhibition, mimics transfection or siRNA
transfection, and 30 h after lentiviral transduction.
2.5. RNA preparation and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using the miRNEasy kit (Qiagen).
Levels of mRNA were quantiﬁed by qRT-PCR using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) for AGO2

5 -CGTGGCGTCTTCCAGAAT-3 ). Primers were used at 300 nM ﬁnal
concentration. GAPDH was used as a loading control for AGO2, primiR-126 and pri-miR-132. RNU6 was used as a loading control for
all mature miRNAs (Applied Biosystems).
2.6. Immunoblots and antibodies
Primary antibodies were prepared at 1:1000 for AGO1 (Cell
Signalling, D84G10), AGO2 (Cell Signalling, C34C6), CREB (Cell
Signalling, 48H2), phospho-CREB at Ser133 (Cell Signalling, 87G3),
1:500 for EP300 (Abcam, 3G230), RASA1 (Santa Cruz, B4F8), and
1:5000 for ␤-actin (Cell Signalling, AC-15). Secondary goat antimouse (Dako, P0447) and goat anti-rabbit (Dako, P0448) antibodies
were prepared at 1:5000 conjugated to HRP. Western blot analysis was carried out using ImageJ software for quantifying band
intensities.

2.8. Let-7 silencing reporter assay
The let-7 silencing reporter assay was carried out in HeLa cells
as previously described by (James et al., 2010) in the presence
of NTC/miR-132 mimics (20 nM) or siNTC/siAGO2 (20 nM). The
luciferase reporter used (40 nM) contained either a single fully complementary site (si) or a seven times repeat of a mismatched site
(mi7) for let-7 binding.
2.9. Statistical analysis
Experimental results are presented as mean ± S.E. (error bars)
and were performed in 3 independent replicates unless otherwise stated in the ﬁgure legend. Where appropriate, a two-tailed
unpaired Student’s t-test was used to calculate the signiﬁcance of
the difference between treatments.

2.7. Luciferase reporter assay

3. Results

AGO2 3 UTR and EP300 3 UTR were ampliﬁed from HDLEC cDNA
and subcloned into the psiCheck2 vector (Promega) using NotI and
XhoI enzymes. Mutations were introduced at the AGO2 3 UTR at
the miR-132 binding site (WT: 5 -GUACAAUCCUUUUUCACUGUUU3 ; Mut: 5 -GUACAAUCCUUUUUCACUAAAU-3 ). Luciferase assays
were performed in HeLa cells. AGO2 and EP300 UTR constructs
were transfected for 24 h after the 24 h miR-132 mimics (20 nM)
or NTC transfection. Relative light units (RLU) were measured with
a Fluoroscan Ascent FL luminometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc).

3.1. miR-132 interacts with the AGO2 3 UTR
Gene ontology analysis of predicted miR-132 targets, using the
EIMMO prediction analysis tool (Hausser et al., 2009), indicated
that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) were over-represented amongst
miR-132 predicted targets (Supplementary Table 1). We utilised a
lentiviral construct containing the miR-132/miR-212 locus (Lagos
et al., 2010) to screen for the effect of miR-132 on mRNA levels of 13
RBPs that were predicted miR-132 targets by multiple algorithms

(Supplementary Table 2). Over-expression of miR-132 and miR-212
in HDLECs resulted in a drop in AGO2 mRNA (Fig. 1A). The effect was
abolished when using a construct where the seed sequence of both
miR-132 and miR-212 is mutated (Fig. 1A).
We identiﬁed a potential miR-132 binding site in the AGO2
3 UTR. The binding site is conserved across mammalian species
with the exception of Sorex araneus (Fig. 1B). Based on this, we
further investigated whether miR-132 interacted with the AGO2
3 UTR region. The introduction of miR-132 mimic into HeLa cells
led to a drop in luciferase signal for a reporter containing the AGO2
3 UTR (Fig. 2A), compared to the non-targeting control (NTC). A
triple consecutive base pair mutation introduced at the start of the
seed site of the miR-132 binding in the AGO2 3 UTR reversed the
suppression of luciferase activity by miR-132 mimic. The effect of
miR-132 on the AGO2 3 UTR was similar to that on the EP300 3 UTR,
a known miR-132 target (Lagos et al., 2010). We should note that
endogenous miR-132 expression in HeLa cells is at similarly low
levels to those observed in HDLEC.

over-expression of the miR-132/miR-212 cluster (Fig. 1A) correlated with decreased AGO2 protein levels (Fig. 3A). Transfection
of synthetic miR-132 mimics into HDLECs suppressed AGO2 protein expression to the same extent as the known miR-132 targets
EP300 and RASA1 (Fig. 3B), and also resulted in a drop in AGO2
mRNA (Fig. 3C). The suppression of AGO2 in HDLECs was miR132-dose-dependent with maximum suppression observed when
using 15–25 nM concentration (Fig. 3D; Supplementary Fig. 2). To
verify that the effect of miR-132 on AGO2 expression in HDLECs
was indeed through direct targeting of the AGO2 3 UTR region,
we utilised a lentiviral construct expressing FLAG-tagged AGO2
but lacking its 3 UTR region (AGO2−UTR ). We found that AGO2−UTR
expression in HDLECs was not affected by miR-132 mimics (indicated by anti-FLAG M2, Fig. 3E). As expected, miR-132 mimics in
AGO2−UTR over-expressing HDLECs resulted in a drop in endogenous AGO2, shown by a decrease in total AGO2 levels.

3.3. miR-132 over-expression affects AGO2 function
3.2. miR-132 over-expression suppresses AGO2 expression
Having shown that miR-132 can directly interact with the predicted miR-132-binding site in the AGO2 3 UTR, we studied the
effect of miR-132 over-expression on AGO2 expression. Transfection of miR-132 synthetic mimics into HeLa cells resulted in a
decrease in AGO2 protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 2B and C). Similarly,
in HDLECs the observed decrease in AGO2 mRNA levels following

Next, we tested whether the observed level of AGO2 regulation by miR-132 was functionally relevant. We employed an
endogenous let-7a silencing reporter constructs containing a fully
complementary (si) or multiple copies of bulged (mi7) Let-7
binding sites downstream of a luciferase reporter as previously
described (James et al., 2010). The si reporter gives a read-out of
the RNAi function of AGO2, which relies on full complementarity
between the small RNA (in this case let-7a) and the target. The

mi7 reporter provides a read-out of the miRNA silencing function
of Ago2 as it is not susceptible to cleavage by AGO2 endonuclease activity. We observed that the introduction of miR-132 mimics
or siAGO2 resulted in derepression of both siRNA and miRNA
reporter constructs, as indicated by derepression of the Rluc activity
(Fig. 4A). These ﬁndings show that miR-132-mediated regulation
of AGO2 is sufﬁcient to negatively impact AGO2 siRNA and miRNAmediated silencing functions, thus further deﬁning the importance
of this regulatory feedback mechanism.
To test the functional signiﬁcance of miR-132-mediated suppression of AGO2 in HDLECs, we took advantage of the fact that
loss of AGO2 expression results in decreased miRNA expression
(Schmitter et al., 2006; Morita et al., 2007). We conﬁrmed that
this was the case in HDLECs by determining expression of several
miRNAs following siRNA mediated knockdown of AGO2 (Fig. 4B).
Similarly, miR-132-mediated AGO2 suppression resulted in downregulation of miR-126 and miR-221 (Fig. 4C). The decrease in
mature miR-126 levels was due to a reduction in the mature to
primary miRNA ratio (Fig. 4D), suggesting that post-transcriptional
regulation of miR-126 contributes to the reduction in its levels in
miR-132-over-expressing HDLECs, being consistent with the effect
of miR-132 on AGO2 expression. This was further supported by
the fact that physiologically relevant over-expression of AGO2−UTR
in HDLECs transfected with control or miR-132 mimics partially
restored miR-126 and miR-221 expression. Over-expression of
miR-132 in HDLECs transduced with control lentivirus (pSIN)
resulted in statistically signiﬁcant down-regulation of miR-126 and
miR-221. In contrast, transfection of miR-132 mimics in HDLECs
transduced with AGO2 lentivirus did not signiﬁcantly affect miR126 and miR-221 levels (Fig. 4E).
3.4. PMA induces miR-132 expression in HDLECs
miR-132 expression is transcriptionally controlled by CREB activation (Lagos et al., 2010; Remenyi et al., 2010; Vo et al., 2005). We

used PMA, a potent activator of PKC that results in CREB phosphorylation (Mao et al., 2007). We showed that CREB is phosphorylated
during the ﬁrst few hours post-PMA treatment and the effect is lost
after 24 h (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. 3A). The activation of CREB
led to an induction of mature miR-132 expression over a range of
PMA concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 3B). The most potent and
sustained induction of miR-132 was obtained following treatment
with 25 nM PMA and this concentration was used for all further
experiments.
The expression of primary and mature miR-132 was measured at 6 h and 24 h post-PMA treatment (Fig. 5B) and a more
detailed time-course of expression was performed over 48 h
(Fig. 5C). Consistent with CREB-mediated transcriptional activation, pri-miR-132 was up regulated during the ﬁrst few hours
post-PMA treatment and returned to near-baseline expression
level by 24 h. However, mature miR-132 levels showed only a
modest decrease over the time-course following the initial induction, suggesting it was more stable than pri-miR-132 in these
conditions.

3.5. Inhibition of endogenous miR-132 leads to increased AGO2
expression
We have previously shown that miR-132 expression in HDLECs
becomes functionally relevant only when induced (Lagos et al.,
2010). Therefore, we exploited the PMA-inducible miR-132 expression in vitro system in HDLECs to determine the effect of
endogenous miR-132 on AGO2 expression. Inhibition of miR-132
induction (Fig. 6A) resulted in statistically signiﬁcant induction of
AGO2 expression in PMA-treated HDLECs (24 h), an effect that was
not observed in HDLECs transfected with control miRNA inhibitors
(Fig. 6B and C). PMA treatment or miR-132 inhibition did not affect
AGO2 mRNA levels (Fig. 6D).

As the changes in AGO2 expression following PMA treatment
and miR-132 inhibition were modest, we tested whether such
effects could affect AGO2 function. We over-expressed AGO2−UTR
during PMA-activation of HDLECs to a similar level (Fig. 7A) as
observed during miR-132 inhibition. This level of over-expression
of AGO2−UTR in HDLECs resulted in a modest increase in expression of miR-126, miR-132, miR-146a, and miR-221, the effect
being more prominent for the latter two miRNAs (Fig. 7B).
miR-221 was down-regulated and miR-146a up-regulated during
PMA-activation (Fig. 7C). In agreement with these ﬁndings and the
effect of miR-132 on AGO2 expression (Fig. 6B), we observed an
increase in miR-221 and miR-146a expression in response to miR132 inhibition in PMA-activated HDLECs (Fig. 7D), while miR-126
expression was unaffected. Overall, these results further supported
that endogenous miR-132 can regulate AGO2 expression in activated HDLECs.

4. Discussion
Here we demonstrate that miR-132 can suppress expression of
AGO2 through a canonical miRNA-mediated silencing mechanism,
and that this interaction ﬁne-tunes AGO2 expression in activated
primary endothelial cells. Our ﬁndings indicate that steady state
expression of some miRNAs is highly sensitive to changes in
AGO2 expression in HDLECs. This is in agreement with previous
reports demonstrating that loss of AGO2 has variable effects on
steady-state levels of individual miRNAs (Diederichs and Haber,
2007; Winter and Diederichs, 2011; Bronevetsky et al., 2013).
Importantly, we ﬁnd that miR-132 is involved in modulating the
availability of AGO2 to perform its function in siRNA and miRNAmediated silencing and in stabilising miRNA expression (Winter
and Diederichs, 2011). This provides support for a model according to which post-transcriptional regulation of miR-132 by AGO2

is coupled to miR-132 mediated regulation of AGO2, maintaining
optimal miR-132 and AGO2 expression during haematopoietic or
endothelial cell activation. Although basal miR-132 expression is
low in non-neuronal cells, during cellular activation its expression increases to functionally relevant levels as demonstrated by
its role in modulating the innate immune response (Lagos et al.,
2010) and angiogenesis (Anand et al., 2010). Of note, miR-132 has
been previously shown to participate in similar negative feedback
loops maintaining homeostatic levels of EP300 in endothelial and
immune cells (Lagos et al., 2010) and MeCP2 expression in neurons, where the baseline expression of miR-132 is higher but also
inducible (Klein et al., 2007). We speculate that the propensity of
miR-132 to form negative feedback loops with its mRNA targets is
essential for its activity-dependent expression and function both

outside and within the brain. Our ﬁndings indicate that in PMAtreated HDLECs mature miR-132 is substantially longer-lived than
its primary transcript, which might provide one possible explanation for the need for multiple negative feedback loops controlling
miR-132 expression and function.
In our study, we focussed on endothelial cells as miR-132 has
been shown to regulate angiogenic and inﬂammatory responses in
these cells. For the same reason, when looking for functional consequences of AGO2 regulation we chose to measure expression of
miRNAs that have previously been reported to be involved in angiogenesis or inﬂammation. For example, miR-221 (Poliseno et al.,
2006; Li et al., 2009) is known as an anti-angiogenic miRNA, miR126 is essential for endothelial cell survival (Sun et al., 2010; Wang
et al., 2008), and miR-146a involved in inﬂammatory responses in

endothelial cells (Lagos et al., 2010). We show that treatment of
HDLECs with PMA results in an induction of the pro-angiogenic
miR-132, and a decrease in the anti-angiogenic miR-221 expression, in agreement with the previously reported pro-angiogenic
activity of PMA (Montesano and Orci, 1985). Interestingly, during
endothelial cell activation, minimal over-expression of AGO2 or
inhibition of miR-132 result in increased miR-221 and miR-146a
expression, in agreement with the proposed miR-132-mediated
AGO2 regulation. We should note that the magnitude of the effect
of miR-132 inhibition on miR-221 and miR-146a indicates that
other factors also contribute to the regulation of these miRNAs
in activated HDLECs. However, our results suggest that regulation of AGO2 due to miR-132 induction is a failsafe mechanism
that ensures maintained suppression of miR-221, and limits the
extent of the anti-inﬂammatory activity miR-146a (Fig. 7E). Indeed,
miRNAs are often components of such coherent (e.g. miR-221) or
incoherent (e.g. miR-146a) feed forward loops (Herranz and Cohen,
2010). It would be interesting to further investigate the relevance
of this intricate miRNA network in in vivo models of angiogenesis
and in cells with high basal miR-132 expression, such as neurons.
Validated miR-132 targets are involved in chromatin modiﬁcations (e.g. MeCP2, EP300, Jarid1a, SIRT1) (Alvarez-Saavedra et al.,
2011; Yamakuchi, 2012) transcription (e.g. EP300) (Hasan et al.,
2001), and mRNA splicing (e.g. PTBP2) (Smith et al., 2011), indicating a functional clustering of miR-132 targets around modulators
of the lifecycle of a mammalian mRNA. We substantially expand
this concept to cover mRNA silencing, by revealing that miR132 can suppress AGO2. The major implication of these ﬁndings
is that a miR-132 can potentially act as a concurrent regulator
of transcription, splicing, and silencing in the cell. Deﬁning how
these fundamental processes communicate is of paramount importance and particularly relevant to cellular stress responses, which
are characterised by highly dynamic, and accurate gene expression programmes. We propose that the potential of miR-132 in
coordinating multiple molecular processes that determine gene
expression can provide crucial clues towards understanding the
complex and context-speciﬁc role of this miRNA in neurons and
haematopoietic and vascular cells.
