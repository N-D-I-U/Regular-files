ABSTRACT. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a type of non-protein-coding
single-stranded RNA, which are typically 20-25 nt in length. miRNAs play
important roles in various biological processes, including development,
cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. We aimed to detect the
miRNA response to cocaine stimulations and their target genes. Using the
miRNA expression data GSE21901 downloaded from the Gene Expression
Omnibus database, we screened out the differentially expressed miRNA
after short-term (1 h) and longer-term (6 h) cocaine stimulations based on
the fold change >1.2. Target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were
retrieved from TargetScan database with the context score -0.3. Functional
annotation enrichment analysis was performed for all the target genes with
DAVID. A total of 121 differentially expressed miRNAs between the 1-h
treatment and the control samples, 58 between the 6-h treatment and the
control samples, and 69 between the 1-h and the 6-h treatment samples.
Among them, miR-212 results of particular interest, since its expression
level was constantly elevated responding to cocaine treatment. After
functional and pathway annotations of target genes, we proved that miR212 was a critical element in cocaine-addiction, because of its involvement
in regulating several important cell cycle events. The results may pave
the way for further understanding the regulatory mechanisms of cocaineGenetics and Molecular Research 12 (4): 6160-6167 (2013)

INTRODUCTION
The study of the post-transcriptional gene regulation was scarce until a few years ago.
Since the let-7 was first found in Caenorhadbitis elegans (Vella et al., 2004), the study of miRNAs
in general, and of their functions in particular, has gained attention and is moving quickly forward.
Over the past few years, we have found that miRNAs play important roles not only in the normal organism, such as embryonic development, angiogenesis and inflammation (Brennecke et al.,
2003; Chen, 2005), but also in a number of major diseases (Calin et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2007;
Zhang and Farwell, 2008). miRNAs are also used as therapeutic drugs in clinical practice (Chan et
al., 2005; Eis et al., 2005).
miRNAs are a class of very short non-coding regulatory small molecules, which are single-stranded RNAs, approximately 20~25 nt (in some cases, less than 20 nt). They are generated
from the single-stranded RNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) whose lengths are between 70~80 nt after
shearing (Bartel, 2004). miRNAs inhibit the translation of their target mRNAs by complementarily
binding to the 3'-untranslated region (3' UTR). In a few cases, the binding areas are in the 5'-UTR or
coding region (Brennecke et al., 2003). The vast majority of miRNAs is located in the intergenic regions, and can exist as either single copy, multiple copies or appear as gene clusters or other forms
(Lim et al., 2003; Rodriguez et al., 2004). miRNAs play a variety of regulatory roles in the metabolic processes in the body and their transcription is independent of the other gene, and will not
be translated into proteins (Carthew, 2006; Kloosterman and Plasterk, 2006). miRNAs are highly
conserved across species, and their stem areas are generally more conservative and more mutation
sites may exist in the loop parts. About 3% of human genes encode miRNAs, and more than 30%
of the coding genes are regulated by miRNAs (Lewis et al., 2005; Lim et al., 2005). miRNAs play
important roles in various biological processes, including development, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis (Miska, 2005). However, their abnormal expression may lead to the some
diseases (Kloosterman and Plasterk, 2006).
All identified miRNAs are registered in the “miRBase” database (Griffiths-Jones et al.,
2006, 2008; Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2011). New miRNAs may be discovered through
bioinformatic methods in genome-wide scan of conservative stem-loop structures. Experimental
methods can be also utilized by cloning the small RNA library for sequencing. Northern blot, microarray, real time RT-PCR and other techniques can be used for quantitative detection of miRNAs
in a specific time and tissue. However, each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages: 1)
Northern blot is highly accurate, but it requires high quantity and quality of samples, 2) microarray
has the advantage of high throughput, but the data need further experimental verification, implicating high cost (Huang et al., 2007) and making it more useful for initial mass screening, 3) RT-PCR
detection is highly sensitive, with wide range of applications and relatively lower cost, but with
high false positive rate that generally requires re-validation by northern blot.
The functional study of miRNAs started by focusing on specific miRNAs or miRNA families and determined the possible functions by loss-of-function mutations. Subsequently, the invention of the oligo-nucleotide complementary translation method, gave rise to a very effective way to
silence miRNAs in part of the cell lines. In addition, knocking out the Dicer enzyme has also been

proved effective for miRNA silencing.
The screening of target genes is usually carried out using a combination of experimental
and bioinformatic methods. According to the miRNAs known functions, related functional genes
can be screened out to and further experimentally validated (i.e., experiments coupled with a luciferase reporter system).
In this study, we used two sets of miRNA expression data, one from cocaine-treated samples, and the other one from controls (not treated), to identify the miRNAs which may play regulatory roles in cocaine-addictive rats. Additionally, we also conducted miRNA interference experiments. Based on the gene expression data obtained, we annotated the miRNA target genes using
functional and pathway information to illustrate the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in human
responding to cocaine.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Expression profiles of the miRNAs in the cocaine-treated samples and miRNA
interference
Using rat as the animal model, we obtained the miRNA expression data GSE21901
(Hollander et al., 2010) in cocaine-treated rat dorsal striatum samples from the GEO (Gene
Expression Omnibus, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) database (Edgar et al., 2002;
Barrett et al., 2007, 2011) to study the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms upon
cocaine stimulation in vivo. Based on the NCode miRNAs microarray 474, data included
three types of samples: 1) miRNA expression data collected 1 h after 0.5 mg/kg intravenous
cocaine injection (restricted), 2) miRNA expression data collected 6 h after 0.5 mg/kg
intravenous cocaine injection (extended), and 3) control group (not treated). Each type of
data was in triplicate.
We first obtained the sequence of rno-miR-212 from the miRBase database, and its
homologous human counterpart hsa-miR-212 using the BLAT algorithm in the UCSC database
(Kent et al., 2002). The mRNA expression data were obtained from miR-212 overexpression in
the human HEK 293 cell line (Hollander et al., 2010), using the HG-U133_Plus_2 (Affymetrix
Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array) platform.

Pre-treatment of the expression data
For the miRNA and mRNA expression data sets, we first mapped the probes to the
miRNA names and the Entrez Gene IDs in the miRBase, respectively. If a number of probes
matched to an miRNA or a gene, we considered the average value as the expression level for
this miRNA or gene. The log2 ratio for the expression data was then calculated.

Differential expression analysis
The differentially expressed miRNAs between restricted samples, extended samples, and controls or the differentially expressed genes between the overexpressed samples
of miR-212 in HEK 293 cell lines and the control samples were identified by using a filter
based on a fold change of 1.2.

Study of MicroRNA functions

miRNAs target genes
The conservative miRNAs target genes between rat and human were retrieved from
the TargetScan database (Grimson et al., 2007) with the context score -0.3.

Functional and pathway annotations
To recognize the biological functions of these differentially expressed miRNAs, we
performed the functional and pathway enrichment analysis on the target genes of the miRNAs
based on GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes). In
addition, GO and KEGG analysis was performed on the differentially expressed target genes
caused by overexpression of miR-212, to uncover regulatory mechanism of the highly expressed miR-212 in response to the cocaine stimulation and its impact on the cocaine addiction.
DAVID (database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery, Huang et al., 2009),
a clustering tool based on the hypergeometric distribution, was chosen in our study to fulfill
this analysis. False discovery rate (FDR) corrected P value less than 0.05 was set as the cutoff.

RESULTS
Differentially expressed miRNAs
Based on the fold change of 1.2, we identified 121 differentially expressed miRNAs between the restricted and the control samples, 58 between the extended and the control samples, and
69 between the restricted and the extended samples. We found that the expression levels of large
amount of miRNAs changed after cocaine-treatment for 1 h (restricted), but some of them returned
to normal level after 6-h treatment (extended). However, comparing the restricted with the extended
samples, we found that different miRNAs were activated in response to cocaine stimulation at different time points. More interestingly, we found that miR-212 showed high expression level in all
three groups in the differential analysis, and its expression kept increasing as cocaine was absorbed,
thereby suggesting a key role for miR-212 in the response to cocaine consumption in the body.

Functional annotation of the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs
miRNAs exert important regulative role by post-transcriptionally controlling their target
genes or directly degrading their target mRNAs. To illustrate the functions of the miRNAs in
response to cocaine stimulation, we applied the algorithm TargetScan, used for miRNAs target genes
prediction. For the comparison restricted vs control, extended vs control, and restricted vs extended,
11,980, 12,008, and 11,892 miRNA target genes were, respectively, predicted based on the context
score of -0.3. Notably, three compared groups shared 11,411 target genes, suggesting that in different
cocaine treatment, different miRNAs are activated, and regulate the same or similar target genes to
complete a common stimulated response. We performed the GO and KEGG annotations to show the
functional categories and metabolic pathways these miRNA target genes belonged to, with the FDR
threshold set to 0.05. For the comparison restricted vs control, extended vs control, and restricted vs
extended, the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were mapped to 162, 167, and 164
functions or pathways, respectively. Like sharing highly conserved target genes, the three compared

groups resulted to be involved in 152 similar biological functions or metabolic pathways. Thus,
the differentially expressed miRNAs may have similar functions in response to cocaine, and may
interact with different target genes at different response stages.

Functional annotation of the target genes of miR-212
We found that the expression level of miR-212 was constantly elevated in both time
points after cocaine stimulation, suggesting that miR-212 may play a key role in regulating
the body’s response to cocaine treatment. The identification of the downstream functions or
pathways of the overexpressed miR-212 are important to find out the molecular mechanism
underlying this regulation in response to cocaine stimulation. Therefore, miR-212 overexpressed microarray expression profile was obtained.
We identified 1760 differentially expressed genes in the miR-212 overexpressed human HEK 293 cell-line and the control sample based fold change >1.2. Using the TargetScan
database, we obtained 2426 conserved target genes of has-miR-212 (context score <-0.3), 120
of which were differentially expressed. A total of 39 biological process (P < 0.001) and 6 metabolic pathways (P < 0.05) were found by function and pathway enrichment analysis in 120
highly conserved target genes of miR-212 combining GO and KEGG database (Tables 1 and 2).

DISCUSSION
Cocaine is one of the common drugs, which may cause addiction. Cocaine addiction
is known to be a kind of neural-generative disease, meaning that cumulative cocaine assumption may cause structural or functional damage in the cerebral limbic system. As an important
type of molecules for gene regulation, miRNAs can control the gene expression by binding to
the 3' UTR region of mRNAs and cause its degradation or block its translation. Studies have
shown that such gene regulation can post-transcriptionally alter the expression of downstream
genes, which in turn may be significant in events such as neuron-formation, brain development and cocaine-induced functional change (Eipper-Mains et al., 2011). In this research, we
used the rat miRNA expression data after cocaine treatment, and identified 121 differentially
expressed miRNAs between the restricted and the control samples, 58 between the extended
and the control samples, and 69 between the restricted and the extended samples during the
response period against the cocaine stimulation. Among them, the expression level of miR-212
was found to be highly expressed after cocaine treatment, proving its key role in the regulatory
mechanism for cocaine addiction. These results were also in accordance with previous studies
(Robison and Nestler, 2011; Jonkman and Kenny, 2013).
To further identify its molecular mechanism of miR-212, the expression profile of
overexpressed miR-212 in the human HEK 293 cell line was downloaded, and its target genes
were identified. The functional annotation of these target genes indicated that, overexpressed
miR-212 may change the protein phosphorylation in human bodies. Mattson et al. (2005)
show that cocaine may induce the phosphorylation activity of the transcription factor cAMP
response element binding protein (CREB) by enhancing the functions of several downstream
signal-related inter-cellular kinases. Striatal miR-212 decreases responsiveness to the motivational properties of cocaine by markedly amplifying the stimulatory effects of the drug on
CREB signaling (Hollander et al., 2010). Acute exposure to cocaine singifcantly increases
endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA) within 6-12 h (Pradhan et al., 2008). Coinfusion of cocaine with the endothelin receptor antagonist PD145065 prevented the cocaine induced spasm
(Fandino et al., 2003). Our resuts suggested EDNRA was the target gene of miR-212 which
may exert the same role as the antagonist. Furthermore, Di Francesco et al. (1990) points out
that cocaine may be able to inhibit the proliferation process of the rat fibroblasts by regulating

the synthesis of DNA and proteins, providing an evidence that cocaine may play a role during
the cell cycles. The rat experiment model (Dominguez-Escribà et al., 2006) also shows that
short- or long-term exposure to cocaine may slower cell proliferations. In our study, the functional and pathway annotations of the miR-212 target genes also proved their involvement in
mediating the cell cycle regulations, such as Rb1, which is widely regarded as the molecular
“brake” that controls transition from G1 into S phase of cellular growth (Cozar-Castellano et
al., 2006). Overexpressed miR-212 is also reported targeting the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, Rb1 (Park et al., 2011).
In conclusion, using the toxicological genomics microarray technology, we identified the differentially expressed miRNAs after short-term (1 h) and longer-term (6 h) cocaine
stimulations and their target genes. Among them, miR-212 is of particular interest, since its
expression level is constantly elevated responding to cocaine treatment. Moreover, functional
and pathway annotations of its target genes prove that miR-212 is a key element in cocaineaddiction due to its involvement in regulating several important cell cycle events. This result
may pave the way for further understanding the regulatory mechanisms of cocaine-response
in human bodies and provide a more effective method to suppress cocaine-addiction, using
specific molecular interference therapy.
