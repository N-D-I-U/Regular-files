MicroRNAs upregulated during CD4 þ T cell activation may contribute to the increased efﬁciency of
HIV-1 replication seen following perturbation of the resting state. We have found miR-132 to be highly
upregulated following CD4 þ T cell activation, and show that miR-132 potentiates viral replication in
the Jurkat CD4 þ T cell line. Knockdown of MeCP2, a previously identiﬁed target of miR-132, also
increases HIV-1 replication. To the best of our knowledge, miR-132 is the ﬁrst miRNA reported to
enhance HIV-1 replication.

Introduction

Results and discussion

Permissivity to HIV-1 replication is very low in resting CD4 þ T
cells, but is greatly enhanced upon cell activation (Siliciano and
Greene, 2011). This shift towards a favorable environment for
viral replication is largely driven by widespread transcriptional
changes, including those induced by altered microRNA (miRNA)
expression. MiRNAs are short, non-coding RNAs which mediate
post-transcriptional repression of gene expression, and are estimated to regulate over 50% of human protein-coding genes
(Pasquinelli, 2012). Recent studies have shown that many microRNAs (miRNAs) downregulated following CD4 þ T cell activation
can inhibit HIV-1 replication, either via targeting of the HIV-1
RNA itself (Huang et al., 2007; Nathans et al., 2009), or via the
repression of cellular co-factors of HIV such as Tat partner Cyclin
T1 (Triboulet et al., 2007; Sung and Rice, 2009; Chiang et al.,
2012). We hypothesized that miRNAs which are upregulated
following CD4 þ T cell activation may, on the converse, act to
potentiate HIV-1 replication. We found that miR-132 fulﬁlls both
of these conditions, and as such, is, to the best of our knowledge,
the ﬁrst miRNA identiﬁed to increase HIV-1 replication.

We previously performed miRNA expression proﬁling in resting and PHA-activated CD4 þ T cells isolated from four healthy
donors (Chiang et al., 2012), and observed that miR-132 was very
highly upregulated following activation (Fig. 1A). In order to
conﬁrm the microarray results, we measured miR-132 levels in
ﬁve additional healthy donors, and found a two to ﬁve-fold
increase in miR-132 levels after activation with anti-CD3/28
(Fig. 1B). MiR-132 levels also increased to comparable levels after
PBMCs isolated from relatively young (age 25 and under) and
elderly (60 and over) HIV-positive donors were treated with PHA
(Fig. 1C), suggesting that activation-induced increases in miR-132
expression are unaffected by age or HIV status.
Transfection of synthetic miR-132 into Jurkat cells followed by
infection with replication-competent NL4.3 virus resulted in
increased viral replication (Fig. 2). MiR-132 also appeared to affect
HIV-1 latency, as its over-expression reactivated virus in 2D10 cells
(Fig. 3), a clonal Jurkat cell line latently infected with virus carrying
attenuated Tat and destabilized GFP with a shortened half-life,
which better reﬂects ﬂuctuations in viral gene expression (Pearson
et al., 2008). TNF-a treatment of the 2D10 cell line re-activates
latent virus in a very high percentage of cells, with reestablishment of latency occurring over the course of a few days.
MiR-132 transfection prior to TNF-a treatment of 2D10 cells was
found to delay viral return into latency (data not shown).
Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a transcriptional
regulatory protein (Guy et al., 2011), was previously shown to
be a miR-132 target in the murine brain (Klein et al., 2007;
Alvarez-Saavedra et al., 2011). Overexpression of miR-132 in

Fig. 1. MiR-132 is upregulated in activated CD4 þ T cells. (A) Resting CD4 þ T cells were isolated from four healthy blood donors, and a portion of the cells was activated
with PHA. Activated CD4 þ T cells were harvested two days later, and total RNA was isolated for use in microRNA microarray analysis. Columns represent fold-change in
miR-132 expression following activation. (B) Resting CD4 þ T cells were isolated from ﬁve healthy blood donors, and a portion of the cells was activated with anti-CD3/28
beads. Two days later, total RNA was isolated and quantitative real-time PCR was performed to measure miR-132 levels relative to U6 snRNA; values presented were
normalized relative to miR-132 levels in the resting cells of Donor 5. MiR-132 levels were found to be signiﬁcantly higher following CD4 þ T cell activation (Student’s t-test,
p o0.02). (C) Relative miR-132 levels were measured as above in resting or PHA-activated PBMCs from HIV-positive, viremic donors; no signiﬁcant difference in miR-132
levels was observed between activated cells from young versus elderly donors (Student’s t-test, p 40.05).

Fig. 4. MiR-132 decreases MeCP2 expression in Jurkat cells. (A) Jurkat cells were transfected with miR-132 or the negative control, and MeCP2 mRNA levels (relative
to GAPDH) were measured by qPCR. MeCP2 mRNA was signiﬁcantly decreased following transfection with miR-132 versus the negative control (Student’s t-test, p o0.05).
(B) MeCP2 protein levels were analyzed by Western blot. (C) 2D10 cells were transfected with miR-132 or MeCP2 siRNA, and cell viability was assayed by measuring MTT
production relative to mock transfected cells.

Jurkat cells led to a decrease in MeCP2 mRNA and protein levels
(Fig. 4A and B), indicating that MeCP2 is also a target of miR-132
in T cells. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of MeCP2 also
enhanced NL4.3 production in Jurkat cells, as measured by
luciferase expression of the TZM-bl reporter line infected with
the virus-containing supernatant (Fig. 5A). Neither transfection of
MeCP2 siRNA nor miR-132 affected cell proliferation, as measured
by an MTT assay (Fig. 4C). Unlike miR-132, MeCP2 siRNA was
unable to re-activate latent virus in 2D10 cells (Fig. 3), indicating
that additional targets of miR-132 may be contributing to its
ability to disrupt viral latency.
These data suggest that miR-132 potentiates viral replication,
in a manner which may be partially dependent on its ability to
suppress MeCP2. It has previously been shown that miR-132 is
highly upregulated following infection with Kaposi’s sarcoma
herpesvirus, herpes simplex virus-1, and human cytomegalovirus,
and that miR-132 suppresses the host antiviral innate immune
response by targeting the transcriptional co-activator p300 (Lagos
et al., 2010). While p300 is a known co-factor of HIV-1 transcription (Nekhai and Jeang, 2006), it is also possible that modulation
of p300 expression serves to regulate the innate immune
response during HIV-1 infection. However, in the current study
we did not test this hypothesis, nor the effects of other miR-132

targets on HIV-1 replication. Interestingly, along with being
upregulated by CD4 þ T cell activation, miR-132 expression has
also been shown to increase in murine brain tissue following
cocaine administration (Hollander et al., 2010; Nudelman et al.,
2010), and as cocaine has previously been shown to potentiate
HIV-1 replication (Bagasra and Pomerantz, 1993; Peterson et al.,
1991; Roth et al., 2002), this suggests that miR-132 may inﬂuence
HIV-1 infection in cocaine abusers. While recent work has
provided evidence that miR-217 can enhance Tat transactivation
by down-regulating SIRT1 (Zhang et al., 2012), our ﬁndings
comprise the ﬁrst report of a miRNA which can enhance HIV-1
replication and re-activate latent virus.

Materials and methods
Resting CD4 þ T cells were isolated from healthy donor blood
(Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center, Houston, TX) using the
RosetteSep human CD4 þ T cell enrichment cocktail (STEMCELL);
activated cells were removed using CD30 Microbeads (Miltenyi
Biotec). Cells were activated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA)
treatment (10 ng/mL) or CD3/28 Dynabeads (Invitrogen) and
cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum

were transfected with the indicated miRNAs and siRNAs using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen), followed by infection with NL4.3 virus (the NL4.3 plasmid was obtained from
Malcolm Martin through the AIDS Research and Reference
Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH, and virus was
produced via plasmid transfection into 293T cells). Cells were
washed 24 h post-infection, and virus production was measured
48 h post-infection either by quantifying p24 levels in the supernatant via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Zeptometrix) or by using virus-containing supernatant to infect TZM-bl
cells, with luciferase expression measured using the Luciferase
Assay System (Promega). 2D10 cells were transfected with miRNA
as above, and GFP expression was monitored by ﬂow cytometry.
