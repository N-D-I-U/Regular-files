Aims: The cholinergic system is one of the neurotransmitter systems altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the
most common form of human dementia. The objective of this work was to determine the REST/NRSF involvement in altered ChAT expression in the neocortex and hippocampus of an AD transgenic mouse (homozygous
3xTg-AD) that over-expresses 3 proteins, amyloid-β precursor protein, presenilin-1, and tau, all of which are associated with AD and cause cellular degeneration.
Main methods: Two groups (WT and 3xTg-AD) of 11-month-old female mice were analyzed and compared. Half
of the brains of each group were used for ChAT immunohistochemistry, and Western Blot analyses of ChAT and
REST/NRSF were performed on the other half.
Key ﬁndings: We observed signiﬁcant decreases in the number of ChAT-immunoreactive cells in the Meynert nucleus and of ﬁbers in the frontal motor cortex and hippocampal CA1 area in transgenic mice compared with control mice. An increased level of REST/NRSF protein and a reduction of ChAT protein expression in the 3xTg-AD
mice compared with their controls were also found in both in the latter two cerebral regions.
Signiﬁcance: The increased REST/NRSF expression reported here and its effect on the regulatory region for ChAT
transcription could explain the decreased expression of ChAT in the 3xTg-AD mouse; these ﬁndings may be associated with the degeneration observed in AD.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with a massive loss of cholinergic neurons in the anterior basal brain, the area most vulnerable to the
development of the pathological characteristics associated with AD. The
process governing the heightened vulnerability of cholinergic neurons
in AD and aging depends on their unique metabolic capability, and it
is from the anterior basal brain that the cholinergic nuclei project ﬁbers
to regions such as the neocortex and the hippocampus (Francis et al.,
1999). The main neurotransmitter in these ﬁbers is acetylcholine
(Mesulam, 2004; Mufson et al., 2008), whose synthesis is catalyzed by
the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (Oda, 1999).
Alterations in cholinergic neurotransmission in AD patients in the
neocortex and hippocampus are associated with the early stages of
memory loss (Boissière et al., 1997; Kooi et al., 2011), and reductions

in ChAT protein expression and activity are strongly correlated with
this type of dementia (Wilcock et al., 1982), suggesting that upregulation of ChAT may be caused, at least in part, by the disconnection of
the glutamatergic entorhinal cortex input to the hippocampus, which
occurs early in the disease process (Hyman et al., 1984; Gómez-Isla
et al., 1996; Kordower et al., 2001).
The decreased ChAT mRNA concentration may result from changes
in the transcription of the ChAT gene, possibly in relation to accumulated damage by late stages of this disease (Boissière et al., 1997). The transcription of some genes, such as the ChAT gene, is known to be
modulated by a consensus element, named Repressor Element-1/
Neuron-Restrictive Silencing Element (RE-1/NRSE), which is located in
a 5′ promoter region and regulated by a transcriptional repressor
named Repressor Element-1 Silencing Transcription Factor (REST)/
neuron restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) (Shimojo, 2006). It has been
shown that the human ChAT gene locus contains a sequence that is
homologous to that of murine NRSE (Hahm et al., 1997).
In vitro and in vivo studies show that expression of ChAT, other enzymes, receptors, and ion channels is regulated by REST/NRSF, especially those genes encoding nervous system constituents (Hersh and
Shimojo, 2003; Bruce et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2006); REST/NRSF

contributes to neuronal expression of the ChAT gene by modulating the
NRSE region (Lönnerberg et al., 1996).
REST/NRSF is expressed in both developing and mature neurons; its
role may vary from transcription repressor to activator or modulator,
depending on the cell type where it is expressed as well as on the temporal and spatial contexts of its own expression and that of its molecular
partners. REST/NRSF acts as a genomic platform for integrity, stability,
and speciﬁc regulation, and it is overexpressed in the murine and
human brains during pathology; thus, gene expression is inhibited in
neurodegenerative diseases, e.g., brain tumors, Down's syndrome, epilepsy, ischemia, and Huntington's disease. In this latter neuropathology,
ChAT immunoreactivity levels are low, and REST/NRSF expression levels
are increased, suggesting that REST/NRSF could reduce ChAT gene expression in neurodegenerative pathologies (Calderone et al., 2003;
Smith et al., 2006).
Here, we evaluated the levels of REST/NRSF protein in the 3xTg-AD
mouse model and compared them with previously reported alterations
of ChAT immunoreactivity levels, in order to elucidate the neuronal
mechanisms involved in regulating ChAT expression, which could be related to cell degenerative events observed in brain tissue of AD patients.
Materials and methods
The triple-transgenic mouse (3xTg-AD, harboring APPSwe and
tauP301L transgenes on a mutant PS1M146V knock-in background) was
developed by LaFerla's laboratory (Oddo et al., 2003) and accumulates

intracellular and extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau in an agedependent manner within the hippocampus. A total of thirty-two, 11month-old female 3xTg-AD mice were matched with wild-type 129S/
C57BL/6 mice of equal number, sex, and age to perform histological
(n = 24) and biochemical (n = 8) analyses. These transgenic mice all
had the same genetic and strain background (genotyping was performed on each experimental animal) and were drawn from the colony
maintained by the Neurobiology Institute of UNAM. Animal management was supervised by a licensed veterinarian in accordance with
the principles set forth in the NIH guide for the care and use of laboratory animals, and was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Neurobiology Institute. All mice were housed 4 per cage with access to food
and water ad libitum and under optimal vivarium conditions
(12 h:12 h light–dark cycle, 20 °C, and 40–50% relative humidity).

Genotyping
For DNA extraction, the most caudal tail segments, approximately
0.5 cm long, of the mice were sectioned, placed in Eppendorf® tubes,
and kept at −20 °C until use. After alkaline lysis the sample was used
immediately in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to test for the presence of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau protein genes
and for the mutation in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene. The ﬁrst PCR detected APP and tau as 500 bp and 350 bp bands, respectively. In the second
PCR, PS1 was observed as 2 bands, 350 and 180 bp. The samples were

subsequently loaded onto a 1% agarose gel and monitored under UV
light.
Western Blot analysis
A total of 8 mice, 11-month-old female 3xTg-AD (n = 4) and wildtype (129C57/BL6, n = 4) mice, were sacriﬁced by decapitation to extract their brains and dissect the frontal cortex and hippocampus. The
tissues were weighed and immediately frozen at −80 °C until protein
extraction and quantiﬁcation. To obtain the total protein, the tissue
was sonicated in 920 μL of lysis buffer (Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
20 mM NaF, 0.5 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate) with 80 μL of a protease inhibitor cocktail. The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min
at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatant were processed with the Bio Rad
163-2089 kit to obtain the cytoplasmic fraction including ChAT and
REST/NRSF, and the nuclear fraction containing REST/NRSF.
The protein concentration was estimated in both fractions by the
Lowry method (Lowry et al., 1951). Proteins were separated on SDSpolyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then
incubated with primary antibody: goat anti-choline acetyltranferase
1:1000 (cat. AB144P, Millipore) or rabbit anti-NRSF 1:1000 (cat. H-290,
Santa Cruz). After washing, the membranes were incubated with the
appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody, washed again, incubated
with the ABC kit (Vector), and revealed with the diaminobenzidine kit

3

(peroxidase substrate kit DAB SK-4100, Vector). The gel was observed
by UV trans-illumination, and a photo-documentation image-analyzer
system (ChemiDoc XRS, Quantity One Image Analysis Software) was
used to semi-quantify the corresponding bands. The optical densities
of the various bands were normalized to that of the loading control, either β-actin for the cytoplasmic or laminin B1 for the nuclear fraction.
Immunohistochemical analysis
The 3xTg-AD (n = 12) and control 129SC57/BL6 (n = 12) mice were
deeply anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (85 mg/kg/9.5 mg/kg, i.p.)
and transcardially perfused using 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1 M) containing 1000 IU of heparin and
0.1% procaine. Brains were removed and postﬁxed for 24 h in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. Serial sections (50 μm) were sagittally cut with a vibratome (model 3000, tissue sectioning system; Pelco
International) and collected in PBS with 0.1% sodium azide (Bregma
1.92–2.28 mm lateral, Franklin and Paxinos 2008).
To stain the cholinergic ﬁbers, a primary antibody against ChAT
(polyclonal goat anti-ChAT IgG, Chemicon International Inc.; 1:100)
and a biotinylated secondary antibody (mouse anti-goat, Vector;
1:500) were used. The ABC and peroxidase substrate kits (Vector)
were used to visualize bound antibody. Cholinergic neurons were
stained by incubating with the primary antibody (polyclonal goat
anti-ChAT IgG, Chemicon International Inc.; 1:100) followed by anti-

goat, Alexa 594 (Invitrogen, 1:500). Cholinergic ﬁbers and neurons
were identiﬁed in both control and transgenic mice, and evaluated
using a NIKON microscope (Eclipse 50i). The images were digitalized
with a DS-U2 S Camera at 100× (Plan-Apochromat®, 1.25 NA/160).
The density of ChAT-positive neurons was measured in the Meynert nucleus in its full extension (262.5 × 125 μm) in one focal plane (50 μm
thickness); the density of ChAT ﬁbers was measured in the frontal
motor cortex and hippocampus (CA1) areas. The latter quantiﬁcations
were performed on gray-scale images with a 100× objective lens and
computer-assisted imaging analysis system (Image J) software (National Institutes of Health, USA). All these measurements, including the density of ChAT-positive neurons as well as the ChAT-immunpositive ﬁbers,
were performed by an experimenter who was blind to the identity of
the groups.

Statistical analyses
The results of the Western Blot assays for ChAT and REST/NRSF as
well as morphometric density analyses for ﬁbers and cells (cholinergic
neurons) are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).
All data were evaluated with a Student's t-test in each of the experimental conditions. Results were considered to be statistically signiﬁcant if
P ≤ 0.05. StatView software was used for the analyses.

Results
Increased expression of REST/NRSF protein and reduced expression
of ChAT protein in the frontal neocortex and hippocampus of 3xTg-AD
mice.
Expression of the ChAT and REST/NRSF proteins in both the frontal
neocortex and the full hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice was evaluated
by Western Blot. An expression analysis of ChAT showed it to be
lower in the 3xTg-AD than in the control group (WT), in both cerebral
regions.
In the frontal neocortex of 3xTg-AD mice, ChAT protein decreased by
50% and in the hippocampal region it decreased by 30% compared to WT
control mice (Fig. 1).
Interestingly, compared to the control mice, REST/NRSF expression
increased signiﬁcantly in the nuclear fraction, but it decreased in the cytoplasmic fraction in the transgenic mice (Figs. 2–3) after normalization.
The expression analysis of REST/NRSF in the frontal neocortex,
showed an increase of 30% in the nuclear fraction and a decrease of
60% in the cytoplasmatic fraction from the 3xTg-AD mice compared to
the controls (Fig. 2).
In the hippocampus, the analysis of REST/NRSF expression indicated
an increase of 60% in the nuclear fraction, as well as a decrease of 70% in
the cytoplasmatic fraction, in the 3xTg-AD mice with respect to the controls (Fig. 3).

Decreases in the number of ChAT-immunoreactive cells in the
Meynert nucleus in the anterior basal brain and in ﬁber density in the
frontal motor cortex and hippocampal CA1 area in transgenic mice
(3xTg-AD).
Quantitative analysis of these ChAT immunoreactive ﬁbers revealed
a signiﬁcantly diminished ﬁber density in the 3xTg-AD mouse compared to the (129C57/BL6) WT control. The decrease was 57.2% in the
primary motor cortex and 59.2% in the hippocampal CA1 (Fig. 4).
Decrease of ChAT-immunoreactive cell number in the transgenic
mice (3xTg-AD) compared to control mice (129C57/BL6) in the
Meynert nucleus was observed (Fig. 5).
Conclusion
The increase of REST/NRSF expression has an effect on the decrease
of ChAT transcription found in several degenerative diseases, AD included, as observed in the 3xTg-AD mouse model.
Discussion
A dysfunction in the interaction between REST/NRSF and the ChAT
gene has been implicated in a number of disorders, including different

5

types of cancer (Lawinger et al., 2000; Coulson, 2005; Fuller et al.,
2005; Westbrook et al., 2005; Lv et al., 2010), Down's syndrome (Bahn
et al., 2002; Canzonetta et al., 2008) cardiac hypertrophy (Bingham
et al., 2007), and cerebral ischemia (Calderone et al., 2003; Noh et al.,
2012). Moreover, an increase in REST/NRSF expression and a decline
in ChAT immunoreactivity were reported in a transgenic mouse model
(R6/1) for Huntington's disease (Smith et al., 2006). Taken together,
these ﬁndings suggest that REST/NRSF could down-regulate expression of the ChAT gene in neurodegenerative pathologies. Increased
REST/NRSF leads to decreased ChAT expression, and therefore less
ACh synthesis, which in turn, is progressively diminished in AD and
has clinical implications such as learning and memory loss in these
patients.
The decline of ChAT expression agrees with the ﬁnding that the promoter region of the ChAT gene contains the NRSE consensus region
(Lönnerberg et al., 1996), which is recognized by the REST/NRSF transcription factor; thus, increased REST/NRSF expression could inhibit
the transcription (data not shown) and translation of ChAT in the
3xTg-AD mice. We found an increase in the expression of REST/NRSF
protein in the cell nucleus in the neocortex and the hippocampus; this
is consistent with studies that show that the nuclear localization of
the different transcription factors is crucial for the regulation of genes
associated with the installation of the damage process (Shimojo, 2006).

of the total number of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons in both groups and indicates a signiﬁcant (* P b 0.001) reduction in the number of ChAT-immunoreactive cells in the 3xTg-AD mice.
The arrows indicate ChAT immunoreactive cells.

Our results are the ﬁrst indication that increased expression of
REST/NRSF could explain the decreased ChAT expression in 3xTg-AD
mice: a decrease in both ChAT-immunoreactive ﬁbers in the frontal
motor cortex and hippocampal areas and in ChAT-positive neuron
number in the Meynert nucleus compared with control mice.
Consistent with our data in the 3xTg-AD model, a reduced density of
ChAT-positive cholinergic ﬁbers was found in post-mortem tissue of AD
patients (Wu and Xie, 2006) and correlated with cognitive dysfunctions
(Billings et al., 2005).
Previous studies showed that the presence of amyloid plaques and
neuroﬁbrillary tangles correlated with alterations in neuronal populations localized in areas affected by AD in the anterior basal brain,
i.e., the Meynert nucleus (primary source of cholinergic neurons),
where we found a reduction of ChAT-immunopositive neurons. Histopathological brain changes in AD start in the temporal lobe and extend
to the Meynert nucleus that projects to the hippocampus and to the
frontal, parietal, and occipital cortices, all of which have an important
role in learning and memory (Whitehouse et al., 1981; Mufson et al.,
2008). This is consistent with our ﬁnding of a reduction in ﬁbers
projecting to the primary motor cortex and the hippocampus CA1
area of 3xTg-AD mice.
Our results suggest that REST/NRSF expression is associated with
cellular changes in the neocortex and hippocampus in this 3xTg-AD
mouse model. It will be necessary to quantitatively explore the expression of REST/NRSF in other regions of the brain, such as the amygdala,
and enthorrinal and prefrontal cortices of animals with advanced stages
of Alzheimer's pathology.
