Abstract
Aging-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are the culmination of many different
genetic and environmental influences. Prior studies have shown that RNAs are pathologically altered during the inexorable course of some NDs. Recent evidence suggests that
microRNAs (miRNAs) may be a contributing factor in neurodegeneration. miRNAs are
brain-enriched, small (~22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that participate in mRNA translational regulation. Although discovered in the framework of worm development, miRNAs
are now appreciated to play a dynamic role in many mammalian brain-related biochemical
pathways, including neuroplasticity and stress responses. Research about miRNAs in the
context of neurodegeneration is accumulating rapidly, and the goal of this review is to
provide perspective for these new data that may be helpful to specialists in either field. An
overview is provided about the normal functions for miRNAs, including some of the newer
concepts related to the human brain. Recently published studies pertaining to the roles of
miRNAs in NDs––including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and triplet repeat
disorders—are described. Finally, a discussion is included with theoretical syntheses and
possible future directions in exploring the nexus between miRNA and ND research.

INTRODUCTION: PERTINENT GENERAL
ASPECTS OF NEURODEGENERATIVE
DISEASES
“Neurodegeneration” is a term that has been used to refer to differing topics. Abundant nerve cell death occurs in the course of
normal brain development, and many pediatric neurological diseases are characterized by pathological degeneration of neurons
and/or muscles. Phenomena involving nerve cell death also occur
in animal models and cells in culture. This review is focused upon
the human-specific neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) that afflict
mainly the elderly, particularly trinucleotide repeat diseases,
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and the synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD).
In the course of NDs, neurons lose their connections and die
prematurely. Although highly relevant to “physiological” cell
death, the role of apoptosis in most NDs has not been conclusively
proven, and will not be discussed here in great detail. Each nosological ND entity has its own set of pathological processes, some of
which are presumably unique. However, there are six general ideas
that are relevant at least circumstantially to how microRNA
(miRNA) biochemistry may interact with the pathogenesis of
NDs.
(i) Most NDs are not inherited in patterns that reflect simple
Mendelian genetics
Most prevalent subtypes of NDs, such as AD and PD, are inherited
in a manner termed “sporadic” (as opposed to “familial”), influ130

enced by alleles with limited genetic penetrance, or are caused by
genetic and/or environmental influences as yet uncharacterized
(28, 102). These facts may shift the focus of ND genetic studies
away from “traditional” genes which constitute only ~1%–2% of
human DNA, and towards the other ~50% of transcribed DNA
about which we are mostly ignorant (48, 96).
(ii) Brains of human ND patients show evidence of chronic
stress
ND brains show evidence of considerable cellular stress (77, 105).
Although this may be expected in disease processes that last for
long periods and involve abundant cell death, this response may
prove contributory because the stress response itself could play a
role in the “cascade” effect (see below) that result ultimately in
neurological deficits.
(iii) NDs may be exacerbated in the clinicobiological sense by
the aberrant stimuli of developmental pathways
Some biochemical pathways that are up-regulated during normal
brain development, but down-regulated in normal adulthood, are
then aberrantly up-regulated again in the course of NDs. These
include pathways involved in cell–cell signaling, cell division, neuroplasticity and apoptosis (see reviews 3, 17, 91). In the case of the
microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), there is an mRNA
splicing variant that is more highly represented both in early development and in some neurodegenerative diseases (57, 88). Furthermore, the developmentally up-regulated phosphorylation of MAPT
is also up-regulated in AD neurofibrillary pathology (39, 119).
These are only a few examples of how the up-regulation of

Nelson et al

developmental pathways in the adult milieu may contribute to the
pathological progression of some NDs.
(iv) RNA is pathologically altered in NDs
RNA biochemists are well aware that RNA is labile in even tightly
controlled circumstances. In the course of some NDs, brain RNAs
becomes pathologically altered. These changes have been reviewed
elsewhere (81, 88, 118), but include aberrant RNA oxidation, RNA
degradation, altered RNA splicing and ribosomal changes which
cause mRNA translational frame-shifting abnormalities.
(v) Human NDs are chronic conditions that last for decades
rather than just for several years
Recent studies have established the surprising chronicity of the
processes underlying NDs. Using AD as an example, the time from
patients’ clinical diagnosis to death is typically ~8 years (126).
However, the underlying pathological processes of AD occur over
many decades. Persons at risk for developing AD in their seventh or
eighth decade already show brain metabolic abnormalities by PET
scan even in their third decade of life (103, 112). These are important data because they show that ND pathology involves a longevolving shift in cellular equilibrium, which could be “tipped” even
by subtle genetic and/or environmental influences.
(vi) Pathogenetic mechanisms of ND involve multiple distinct
steps
Most NDs are probably not just a “one-hit” phenomenon, but rather
they probably involve a sequential progression of pathological processes that result collectively in neuronal death and/or compromised connectivity. In the case of AD, the most prevalent hypothesis is the “amyloid cascade hypothesis” (43, 44), and both neuritic
amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are apparently required
to produce the advanced clinical stages of the disease (as described
in 129).
These six features of NDs dovetail on some of the known characteristics of miRNA biochemistry in the brain. As described below,
miRNAs derive from “non-traditional genes”; are related to pathways of cellular stress and neurodevelopment; may be altered by
the changes seen in ND brains such as oxidation; and may ultimately contribute to step(s) that culminate in chronic brain
diseases.

INTRODUCTION: GENERAL ASPECTS
ABOUT TRANSCRIPTIONAL
REGULATION AND miRNAs
In mammalian cells, mRNA levels and protein levels tend to
correlate quite poorly (88). This may be because translation (RNA→Protein) is even more important than transcription
(DNA→RNA) as a nidus for gene expression regulation. More
than 95% of human cellular RNAs are “non-coding” RNAs, that is,
other than mRNA, and most of these molecules participate in translational regulation (48, 96). These and other data have led researchers to seek a better understanding of mRNA translation.
miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs with potent biological
activities involved in mRNA translational regulation (see Figure 1).
Derived from genes that reside between or within protein-coding
genes, miRNAs may be transcribed by RNA polymerase II (usually)
or by RNA polymerase III (16, 19, 66). The precursor RNAs are
processed endonucleolytically and exported to the cytoplasm where
they are further trimmed by dicer protein to their mature form (89).
These “mature”, short (~22 nucleotides in length), single-stranded

miRNAs in Neurodegeneration

miRNAs are bound intimately to argonaute proteins, which apparently mediate miRNAs’ ultimate functions (20, 42). Argonaute
proteins and miRNA biochemical machinery are universal among
eukaryotes, but great diversity is evident in the particular characteristics of miRNA functions in vivo. The canonical function of
argonaute-bound miRNAs is the suppression of target mRNAs. In
other words, an mRNA that is “targeted” by miRNAs may be present
by a cDNA microarray experiment, reverse transcriptase PCR,
Northern blot or other “expression profiling” technique; however,
there would be little or no polypeptide deriving from that mRNA.
Biochemical mechanisms by which miRNAs work are probably numerous depending on the availability of local regulatory
factors (see for example 53, 60, 67, 95, 97). miRNAs are a relatively recent discovery, having been first recognized in animals in
the context of worm development. In the Caenorhabditis elegans
heterochronic pathway, miRNAs participate in the sequential
process of cell fate determination by decreasing the production
of certain proteins despite high levels of their cognate mRNAs
(36, 65, 104). This system provides one contextual paradigm
for miRNA action, in which a “one miRNA, one/few mRNA
target(s)” rule seems to apply in a set developmental staging
schema. However, the characteristics of miRNA-related biochemical pathways have provided many surprises, and more are
no doubt yet to come.
One unexpected characteristic of some human miRNAs is their
very high RNA copy number per cell. Particular miRNAs can be
represented by 1000–30 000 copies per cell or more (1, 72). By
comparison, the large majority of mRNAs typically number less
than 100 copies per cell (21, 115).
If miRNAs participate in gene expression regulation and are
represented in high numbers per cell, how extensive is the cellular
impact of miRNAs? Numerous studies have now established that
miRNAs can have a profound cellular impact by dint of sheer
biochemical promiscuity: each miRNA can regulate hundreds,
thousands or more mRNA targets. This was first indicated by predictive bioinformatics, which showed that evolutionarily conserved
“miRNA recognition elements” are present in the 3′ untranslated
region (3′UTR) of very many mRNAs per miRNA (7, 38, 56, 59,
69, 70, 83). Further studies have exploited the fact that in some
circumstances, miRNAs actually cause down-regulation of target
mRNA, in addition to protein, so that cDNA microarrays could be
compared between functionally miRNA-transfected cells and controls (41, 73, 75, 124). These studies have shown convincingly that
each miRNA can regulate thousands of different mRNA targets.
Hence, these small non-coding RNAs, which are present in very
high gene copy numbers and which work through a powerful translational regulation paradigm, can modify an exceptionally large
number of genes.
Recent studies have revealed intriguing novel aspects of miRNA
function (see Figure 2):
● Some miRNAs are edited post-transcriptionally, and thus their
targets can be profoundly altered (15, 76, 93).
● Some human miRNAs are targeted to the nucleus for as yet
unknown reasons (49).
● miRNAs are shown to alter mRNA splicing and/or DNA methylation in trans (14, 18, 34, 80).
● miRNAs (like siRNAs) may recognize mRNAs outside of the
3′UTR, opening up new possibilities for complex gene expression
regulation (84).

Figure 1. In the mammalian brain as elsewhere, miRNAs subserve multiple fundamental biological roles. Many miRNAs are thought to interact
with thousands of different targets. Post-transcriptional RNA editing
may change mRNA target specifity. References for the different hypothesized functions of miRNAs are given in the text.

Viral-derived miRNAs/siRNAs can play important roles in host
cell biochemistry (23, 30, 111).
● Under some circumstances, miRNAs can increase translation of
targeted mRNAs (10, 11, 47). See note added in proof at end of
article.
● Numerous cell- and organism-level functions as diverse as
immunomodulation (26, 27, 108), endocrine function (29, 101,
109), circadian rhythms (24, 92), metabolic pathways (125), limb
morphogenesis (45) and angiogenesis (63, 100, 120, 128) have
been hypothesized to be regulated by miRNAs.
●

miRNAs IN CELLULAR STRESS
As mentioned above, cellular stress is a conspicuous feature of ND
brains. A detailed catalog of the many roles now thought to be
played by miRNAs in stress is beyond the scope of this review.
However, miRNAs’ expressions have been shown to change dramatically in response to cold and heat stress, hypoxia, oxidative

stressors, arsenic, irradiation, nutrient deprivation and other
stresses (2, 25, 32, 51, 79, 82, 107, 110, 121). Typically, in stress
conditions, a subset of miRNAs are increased, and a subset are
decreased. The subset of miRNAs that are altered in one stress
condition and in one cell type are not necessarily related to the
miRNAs which change expression upon a different stressful stimulus. To illustrate the point, miR-93 is up-regulated in titaniuminduced stress in a human osteoblast cell line and in the liver of
chronically tamoxifen-fed rats, but down-regulated in hypoxic
human trophoblasts; however, miR-93 showed no evident expression change in folate deficiency or arsenic exposure in a lymphoblastic cell line (31, 82, 94, 99).
The biochemical effects of miRNAs during cellular stress can
change dramatically. For example, stress may alter a miRNA : mRNA interaction to produce translational up-regulation of target
mRNAs (10, 11, 47), which is the opposite of “canonical” miRNA
activity. This has prompted speculation that miRNAs may constitute a “safeguard against turmoil”, by altering globally the parameters of translational machinery in the cells during stress (68). Plant
miRNAs also participate in the stress response in part through a
ubiquitin pathway (5, 25); this is intriguing partly because plant
miRNA paradigms have been fundamentally important in understanding the anciently evolved miRNA pathways. In summary,
during any conditions that are attended by cellular stress, such as
NDs, it can be expected that miRNA expression patterns will
change, which would be expected in turn to alter the translation of a
large number of different cellular mRNAs.

miRNAs IN THE MAMMALIAN BRAIN
miRNAs are enriched in human and rodents brain: relative to other
organs, more miRNAs are expressed in brain and at somewhat
higher levels (4, 6, 9, 114, but see 37, 122). Very high-throughput
sequencing experiments have been interpreted to suggest that the
number of miRNAs expressed in human brain is over 1000,
although currently only ~550 have been annotated in all humans
(8). It has been speculated that miRNAs and other non-coding

NDs. A–C show hippocampus. A,B shows
miRNAs (miR-124 and miR-320) that are
expressed predominantly in neurons. By
contrast, let-7b is expressed in both neurons
and glia, so cells outside the neuronal layers
(such as the molecular layer, pink star, of the
dentate granules, dg) are stained. D shows
that cells of the superficial layer of entorhinal
cortex are also stained avidly using a miR-124
probe. In the substantia nigra, miR-320 labels
the pigment-containing cells (E), but miR-107
only labels them barely if at all (F). Scale bars:

RNAs may serve to act as a “complexity multiplier” to help translate the ~25 000 human protein-coding genes into the human
cerebral cortex with its ~1013 neurons, 1018 synapses and the
staggeringly complex processes of neurodevelopment and neurophysiological network integration (35, 88).
The expression of brain miRNAs alters in the course of brain
development. Accordingly, some miRNAs are relatively enriched
during early development in the mammalian brain, and some are
relatively enriched during later development (85, 90). These
changes may relate to biochemical cues in cell fate determination,
apoptosis and/or cell division programming (116). Some miRNAs
are also relatively enriched in different neuronal nuclei, and/or
different cell populations, including neurons or glia (117; see
Figure 2). For example, it was recently shown that some rat miRNAs
are relatively specific to the hippocampus relative to the rest of rat
brain, and another miRNA may be enriched in the substantia nigra
(46, 58). Furthermore, some miRNAs are relatively enriched in
some neuronal cell compartments (somatodendritic vs. axonal)
(64).
The function of brain miRNAs are evidently not related only to
cell fate determination along developmental lineages. miRNAs

may also play important roles in neuroplasticity and in many other
neurobiological functions. These are beyond the scope of this
review, and well discussed previously (61, 62). However, it bears
repeating that probably most of the functions for miRNAs in the
brain as elsewhere have yet to be discovered. The miRNA system is
adaptable and researchers should be as open-minded as possible in
developing testable hypotheses about physiologically relevant
miRNA actions.

miRNAs IN NEURODEGENERATION—AN
EXPANDING RESEARCH CORPUS
The current data that explicitly pertain to miRNAs and neurodegeneration must be characterized as preliminary, reflecting that our
understanding of miRNAs is still in its infancy. However, recent
studies have begun providing important glimpses into the functions
of miRNAs in neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. These
studies have been performed across a variety of cells and organisms. A table of some studies that include animal models is provided (Table 1).

With regard to the functions of miRNAs in neuroprotection and
NDs, experiments in invertebrates have provided important data.
Research from Nancy Bonini’s laboratory have shown that
miRNAs can play an important role in modulating the nerve cell
toxicity of pathologically altered SCA3 (spinocerebellar ataxia
type 3) protein (12, 13). Increased number of polyglutamine
repeats in SCA3 is what mediates the human clinical phenotype
(106), and also correlates with cellular toxicity in the fly eye (13).
SCA3 polyglutamine toxicity is greatly potentiated when miRNA
pathways are inhibited. A particular miRNA (ban) is a factor of
neuroprotection both in SCA3- and MAPT-related neurodegeneration in flies (12, 13). Also in flies, the miRNA miR-7 has been
shown to potentiate stable EGFR signaling in photoreceptor cells
(71). Still another fly miRNA (miR-14) also serves to help enable
appropriate homeostasis in Drosophila eye cells, and particularly
to play a role in adapting to stress (127). Taken together, these
studies from different laboratories in flies demonstrate that animal
miRNAs play a neuroprotective role in stress- and ND-relevant
neuroprotection.
In addition to the studies in invertebrates, recent mammalian
studies have also suggested a role for miRNAs in NDs and neuroprotection. Workers in Paul Greengard’s laboratory used transgenic
mice to give support to the hypothesis that miRNA function is
critical for mammalian neuronal survival (and conversely, compromising miRNAs causes neurodegeneration) (113). In this study, the
cerebellar Purkinje cell-specific Pcp2 promoter was used to drive a
Cre recombinase causing the dicer gene (and the production of most
mature miRNAs) to be knocked down beginning in the second week
of life with Pcp2 gene activation. Loss of cerebellar expression of
both dicer and most mature miRNAs is followed by Purkinje cell
death and dendritic withering neuropathologically, and an ataxia
phenotype develops in the mice. The authors hypothesize that as
dicer down-regulation causes neuronal cell death, then some human
neurodegenerative diseases may be caused by loss of small regulatory RNAs. As dicer is knocked out in the cerebellum, the authors
conclude that their work may be relevant to spinocerebellar ataxias.
In another important work concerning miRNAs in NDs, research
from Asa Abeliovich’s laboratory indicates that a particular
miRNA may play a significant role in PD (58). The authors show
experimentally that miR-133b is relatively highly expressed at the
tissue level in midbrain under normal conditions, but not during
PD. Furhthermore, knocking out miRNAs generally in vivo, or
miR-133b by itself in culture, dramatically decreases tyrosine
hydroxylase and dopamine transporter levels in dopaminergic
neurons. The data also support the hypothesis that miR-133b and

the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor PITX3 regulate
each other’s expression. This study is important for a number of
reasons. First, it indicates a discrete role for a particular miRNA in
dopaminergic function. Second, previously, no particular miRNA–
mRNA pair had been strongly implicated in a prevalent neurodegenerative disease. In other words, these investigators have provided plausible molecular neurobiological breakthroughs for both
miRNA function and dysfunction. This study demonstrates also
how miRNAs can be an important component of a “downward
spiral” during NDs.
Two other excellent recent papers (79, 78) came from Walter
Lukiw’s laboratory. DNA arrays were analysed to evaluate the
expression of a subset of 12 miRNAs in the AD hippocampus in
comparison with non-demented controls and fetal brain. The
results of the expression profiling was that miR-9 is elevated in
both fetal hippocampus and AD hippocampus, miR-128a is
elevated in AD but neither fetus nor non-demented controls, and
miR-125b shows a trend to be increased in AD that is not statistically significant (78). In a second study from the same group (79),
cultured human fetal brain-derived primary neural (HN) cells,
which included both astrocytes and neurons, were treated with
metal salts, such as aluminum and iron sulfates that stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The RNA from HN cells was then
compared using the same DNA miRNA array that was used in the
study of AD brains. Remarkably, the HN cells treated using conditions that activate ROS also had essentially the same changes
(increased expression of miR-9, miR-128 and, to a lesser extent,
miR-125b) vs. controls, as were seen in the AD brain in comparison
with non-demented brains. The authors make several inferences
from these data. First, these data provide evidence in support of the
hypothesis that ROS influence AD brain through pathways specifically mediated by miRNAs. Second, miR-125b, which trends
higher in both AD brain and in ROS-treated HN cells, is predicted
to target the mRNA of synapsin I and synapsin II, and thus downregulation of synapsins in AD may be partially explained by miR125b up-regulation (78, 79).
Some genes have been associated most strongly with NDs, and it
would be interesting to see how strongly these genes are in turn
regulated by miRNAs. Two examples are presented (Figure 3):
beta-amyloid precursor protein and alpha-synuclein, which are
important in the pathogenesis of AD and PD, respectively. An
important characteristic of both of these genes is that studies have
shown that the disease phenotypes in humans can be caused solely
by increasing the expression of the genes (50, 87). As shown in
Figure 3, each of these genes is also predicted to be the target of

multiple miRNAs. These predictions are not validated; however,
they derive from only a single miRNA prediction database and still
more miRNAs could easily target each of these (as well as many
other) mRNAs.
Aside from the associations between miRNA changes and
“classic” NDs, it is also notable that miRNAs may play a role in
other degenerative brain diseases, including the fragile X mental
retardation syndrome. Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) affects generally male carriers of expanded triplet
CGG repeats on the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene.
The polypeptide product of FMR1 is the protein FMRP, which is
effectively silenced during the disease (36, 123). Neuropathologically, FXTAS syndrome is characterized by intranuclear inclusions, white matter changes and atypical appearing astrocytes profiles (40). Numerous lines of evidence suggest that FMRP interacts
with the miRNA machinery, including miRNAs themselves (22,
33, 52, 55, 98). One hypothesis for the etiology of FMR is that a
miRNA derived from the triplet repeat expansion in FMR1’s
3′UTR mediates a methylation event that inhibits profoundly the
transcription of FMR1 (54, 98). This hypothesis has been supported experimentally (74).

of non-coding RNAs, such as miRNAs, in providing a complexity
multiplier for the genome in the human CNS. It is hoped that
research into the normal biochemical brain processes will dovetail
with a better understanding of the pathological processes that these
same molecules and pathways play. Tantalizing preliminary evidence suggests that miRNAs may play an important role in NDs.

miRNAs IN NEURODEGENERATION—
THEORETICAL ASPECTS AND
QUESTIONS FOR THE FUTURE
Most of the details of how miRNAs participate in neurodegeneration have yet to be worked out. Hence, at this point, one may
consider that the current research corpus is mostly a platform for
future gains. Figure 4 shows some of the possibilities related to the
interactions between miRNAs and NDs. Here are questions that
may merit some reflection:
(i) Neurons are distinguished geometrically by their exceptionally
asymmetric shape, with complicated functions requiring protein
translation long distances—in some places, many centimeters—
from the cell nucleus. Do miRNAs play a role in localized control
of mRNA translation, and if so, does perturbation of that localized
translational control contribute to NDs?
(ii) If RNAs are altered in NDs, are miRNAs altered also, and does
ND-related miRNA alterations (eg, oxidation) alter biochemical
function?
(iii) miRNAs are implicated in cell fate determination, apoptosis,
cell division and stress, all of which are pathways thought to be
aberrantly up-regulated in ND brains. Could the miRNA-related
pathways relevant to earlier development be pathogenetic in the
adult brain milieu?
(iv) Do risk factors for NDs (eg, the Apolipoprotein epsilon 4
allele) affect miRNA brain expression?
(v) To what extent are genes that are allelic for NDs, and for
increased or decreased risk for NDs, target for miRNA regulation?
(vi) Is RNA editing of miRNAs changed in NDs?
(vii) What are the prospects for using miRNA-related biochemistry for ND therapeutics?

CONCLUSIONS
The regulation of human genomic expression is tremendously
