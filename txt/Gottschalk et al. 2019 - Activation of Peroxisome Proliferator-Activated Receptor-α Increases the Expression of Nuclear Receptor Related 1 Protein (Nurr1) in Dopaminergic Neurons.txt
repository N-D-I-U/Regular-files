Abstract
Nuclear receptor related 1 protein (Nurr1) is an important transcription factor required for differentiation and maintenance of
midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Since decrease in Nurr1 function either due to diminished expression or rare mutation is
associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD), upregulation of Nurr1 may be beneficial for PD. However, such mechanisms are poorly
understood. This study underlines the importance of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α in controlling the
transcription of Nurr1. Our mRNA analyses followed by different immunoassays clearly indicated that PPARα agonist gemfibrozil strongly upregulated the expression of Nurr1 in wild-type, but not PPARα−/−, DA neurons. Moreover, identification of
conserved PPRE in the promoter of Nurr1 gene followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, PPRE luciferase assay, and
manipulation of Nurr1 gene by viral transduction of different PPARα plasmids confirmed that PPARα was indeed involved in
the expression of Nurr1. Finally, oral administration of gemfibrozil increased Nurr1 expression in vivo in nigra of wild-type, but
not PPARα−/−, mice identifying PPARα as a novel regulator of Nurr1 expression and associated protection of DA neurons.

Introduction
PD is the devastating neurodegenerative disease of ventral
midbrain, which is characterized by the progressive loss of
dopaminergic (DA) neurons [1, 2]. The loss of DA neurons
in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) results in a deficit of dopamine in the striatum. A decrease in striatal level of
dopamine impairs the motor activity in PD patients and has
also been associated with some non-motor symptoms. Recent
studies have identified that DA neurons are associated with
the formation of alpha-synuclein aggregates, which is often
coupled with significant increase in proinflammatory and

oxidative species. While effective, therapeutic interventions
utilizing L-dopa and other approved drugs do not meaningfully address the loss of DA neurons in the SNpc and their projections in the striatum [3, 4]. In line with these findings,
intriguing targets specific to DA neurons have emerged and
may hold significant value for slowing degeneration in at-risk
individuals.
One such target is the conserved nuclear orphan receptor
family (NR4A) which consists of three members: Nur77
(NR4A1), (NR4A2/nurr1), and NOR1 (NR4A3) [5].
Mutations in the NR4A superfamily of nuclear receptor proteins, including the nurr1 gene, have been identified in subsets
in late-onset familial forms of PD [6]. A much broader set of
literature links the activity of nurr1 to the development and
maintenance of DA neurons [7–9]. Nurr1 protein is highly
expressed in mesencephalic DA neurons and appears to be
central to their survival [10]. Nurr1 production is critical to
the expression of genes associated with the production and
storage of DA in DAergic neurons including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) [11–13]. Decreased Nurr1 expression
has been reported in postmortem studies investigating the
brains of PD patients, especially in neurons containing Lewy

Mol Neurobiol

bodies [14]. Nurr1 is also expressed in microglia and astrocytes. Its contribution in these cells has been investigated due
to the protein’s protective properties that are principally based
on its ability to reduce the expression of proinflammatory
genes and optimize Lewy body clearance [5, 15, 16]. Nurr1
is also implicated in synaptic plasticity and its positive modulation may be useful for PD patients suffering from comorbid
symptoms such as anxiety, sleep disturbances, and general
disruptions in the default mode network. Synthetic agonists
aimed to increase Nurr1 activity have been also reported to be
beneficial in animal models of PD [11, 12, 17, 18].
Gemfibrozil, known as Lopid® in the pharmacy, is an
FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug. It has been used safely
in humans for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia for nearly
30 years. It is also an agonist of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (PPAR)α. Here, we report that gemfibrozil and another fibrate drug fenofibrate increase Nurr1
expression in DA neurons. Increase in Nurr1 in WT, but
not PPARα−/−, DA neurons by gemfibrozil, restoration of
gemfibrozil-mediated Nurr1 expression in PPARα−/− DA
neurons by over-expression of PPARα, presence of PPRE
in the promoter of Nurr1 gene, and recruitment of PPARα
to the Nurr1 gene promoter by gemfibrozil treatment suggest that gemfibrozil stimulates the transcription of Nurr1
in DA neurons via PPARα. These results suggest that
gemfibrozil and other PPARα activators may be beneficial for DA neurons.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Dulbecco’s modification of Eagle’s medium (DMEM without
L-glutamine) was purchased from Mediatech (Washington,
D.C.). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Atlas
Biologicals (Fort Collins, CO). Antibiotic-antimycotic solution for cell culture, gemfibrozil, GSK0660 (an antagonist of
PPARβ), GW9662 (an antagonist of PPARγ), and 1-methyl4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+) were obtained from
Sigma. All the antibodies used in this study are listed in
Table 1.

MN9D Cells
MN9D neuronal cell line was obtained from Dr. A. Heller
(University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA) and maintained
in the lab. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
and allowed to differentiate in neurobasal media containing
2% B27, glutamine, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution.
For experiments, prior to gemfibrozil treatment, cells were

incubated in neurobasal media containing B27 minus
antioxidants.

Isolation of Mouse Primary Dopaminergic Neurons
DA neurons were isolated from mixed glial cultures as described earlier by our lab [19]. Animal maintenance and experimental protocols were approved by the Rush University
Animal Care Committee. Briefly, pregnant female C57BL/6
(WT) and PPARα−/− mice were euthanized via cervical dislocation; the embryonic pups (embryonic stage 13.5) removed
and then quickly decapitated in serum-free DMEM.
Considerable effort was made to isolate only the developing
nigra tissue in order to maximize quantities of DA neurons.
The isolated nigra tissue was milled three times, and the cells
centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. Pelleted tissue was resuspended in fresh serum-free DMEM. After three rounds of
centrifugation and resuspension, the cells were plated in 6well plates containing coverslips and incubated for 8 days at
37 °C with 5% CO2 in complete DMEM containing 20% FBS
and antibiotic-antimycotic prior to their use in subsequent
experiments.

Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Coupled PCR
Total RNA was isolated from MN9D cells using V QuickRNA™ MicroPrep kit (Zymogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase
(RT)-PCR was carried out as described earlier [20, 21]
using oligo (dT) as primer and Moloney murine leukemia
virus reverse transcriptase (MMLV-RT, Invitrogen) in a
20-μL reaction mixture. The resulting cDNA was appropriately amplified using Promega Master Mix (Madison,
WI) and the following were primers (Invitrogen) for murine genes:
Nurr1 sense, 5′-CCGGTCATGGCTTTCCCTAA-3′
Antisense, 5′-AGACAGAGGTAGTTGGGTCGG-3′

Amplified products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose
(Invitrogen) gels and visualized by ethidium bromide
(Invitrogen) staining. Response of the glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) gene was used as a loading
control to ascertain that an equivalent amount of cDNA was
synthesized from each sample.

Quantitative Real-Time PCR
The mRNA quantification was performed in ABI-Prism
7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) using iTaq™ Fast Supermix With
ROX (Bio-Rad) and the primers for nurr1 and gapdh
as listed above. The mRNA expression of the targeted
genes was normalized to the level of gapdh mRNA, and
data were processed by the ABI Sequence Detection
System 1.6 software.

Transduction with a Dominant-Negative Mutant
of PPARα (Y464D) and eGFP Lentivirus
Cells were transduced with different lentiviral constructs of
PPARα and GFP as following. Briefly, MN9D or primary DA
neurons cultured in 6-well pates were transduced with e-GFP-,
full-length PPARα, or truncated PPARα Y464D-lentiviral particles at a MOI of 100 in serum-free media containing Lglutamine (Invitrogen) for 48 h. Cells were further incubated
for 18 h prior to treatment. Transduction efficiency was measured by comparing relative expression of GFP viewed in the
cy2 channel on the Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope.

Immunostaining
Immunoblotting
Immunofluorescence was performed as described earlier.
Briefly, MN9D cells and/or mouse primary DA neurons
were cultured to 70–80% confluence in 8-well chamber
slides or 6-well culture dishes containing coverslips, fixed
with chilled methanol (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA)
overnight, followed by two brief rinses with filtered
PBS containing Tween 20 (Sigma) and Triton X-100
(Sigma) (PBSt). Samples were blocked with 2% BSA
(Fisher Scientific) in PBSt for 30 min and incubated at
room temperature under shaking conditions for 24 h in
PBSt containing the following anti-rabbit or anti-mouse
primary antibodies: Nurr1 (1:250, anti-rabbit; Millipore;
AB5778) and TH (1:200 Immunostar, Hudson WI)
(Table 1). After three 15-min washes in filtered PBSt,
slides were further incubated with Cy2-, Cy3-, or Cy5labeled secondary antibodies (all 1:200; Jackson
ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h under similar
shaking conditions. Following three 15-min washes with
filtered PBS, cells were incubated for 4–5 min with 4′,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:10,000; Sigma). The
samples were run in an EtOH and xylene (Fisher) gradient, mounted, and observed under an Olympus BX51
fluorescence microscope.

It was performed as described earlier [22–24]. Briefly, cells
were washed 3 times with 1 mL of filtered PBS containing
1:1000 protease/phosphatase inhibitors and centrifuged at
6000 rpm for 5 min. Isolated cell pellets were homogenized
in RIPA buffer for 30 min. Total cell lysate was further homogenized and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. A
total of 30 μg protein was loaded and electrophoresed followed by transferring of proteins onto a nitrocellulose membrane
(Bio-Rad). The membrane was then blocked in 50% Odyssey
Blocking Buffer (Li-COR, Lincoln, NE) followed by blocking
with primary antibodies for Nurr1 (1:200, anti-rabbit;
Millipore; AB5778) and β-actin (1:800; Abcam, Cambridge,
MA). The next day, membranes were washed, incubated in
secondary antibodies (all 1:10,000; Li-COR), and visualized
under the Odyssey® Infrared Imaging System (Li-COR,
Lincoln, NE).

Densitometric Analysis
Protein blots were analyzed using ImageJ (National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda). Target bands were normalized to their
respective β-actin loading controls. Data are representative of

modulate the expression of Nurr1 gene, we performed a series
of dose- and time-response studies for Nurr1 gene expression
in mouse MN9D dopaminergic neuronal cells. Interestingly,

increasing doses of gemfibrozil (Fig. 1a) significantly upregulated the expression of Nurr1 mRNA with maximum at

genes, in MN9D neuronal cells under similar treatment conditions (Fig. 1a, d). Since we could not detect Nur77 and Nor1
in MN9D dopaminergic neuronal cells, to understand whether
our PCR conditions were optimum for detecting Nur77 and
Nor1, we examined the mRNA expression of Nurr1, Nur77,
and Nor1 in liver of normal C57/BL6 mice. As evident from
Supplementary Figure 1, mouse liver expressed Nurr1,
Nur77, and Nor1 mRNAs, suggesting that our PCR conditions are capable of identifying all three mRNAs. While
10 μM gemfibrozil-mediated increase in Nurr1 was maximum
at 2 h (Fig. 1c), 25 μM fenofibrate displayed highest stimulation at 1 h of treatment (Fig. 1f).
Nurr1 expression has been reported to be downregulated in
the postmortem brain tissue isolated from PD patients [14].
Therefore, we examined if a nigral toxin like 1-methyl-4phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+) could downregulate the expression of Nurr1 in MN9D cells. Indeed, both semiquantitative and real-time PCR studies indicate a dosedependent reduction in Nurr1 expression by MPP +
(Fig. 2a, b). With this finding in mind, our next goal was to
test if the addition of gemfibrozil could rescue Nurr1 expression in MPP+-insulted MN9D cells. MN9D cells were pretreated with 2 μM of MPP+ for 2 h for the downregulation
of Nurr1 followed by treatment with gemfibrozil for additional 2 h. Interestingly, the addition of 10 μM of gemfibrozil significantly upregulated the Nurr1 expression in
MPP+-insulted MN9D cells (Fig. 2c, d). Taken together,
these findings indicate that gemfibrozil is capable of upregulating Nurr1 in neuronal cells even in the presence of
a nigral toxin.
Next, we assessed Nurr1 protein levels in MN9D cells
following gemfibrozil stimulation. Both immunofluorescence
(Fig. 3a) and immunoblot (Fig. 3d) analyses revealed that
10 μM of gemfibrozil stimulated the expression of Nurr1 protein in MN9D neuronal cells. The result was further confirmed
with respective cell counting (Fig. 3b), MFI (Fig. 3c), and
densitometric analyses (Fig. 3e). Together, these studies indicate that gemfibrozil has the ability to upregulate both Nurr1
mRNA and protein expression in MN9D neuronal cells.

Involvement of PPARα, but Neither PPARβ Nor PPARγ, in
Gemfibrozil-Mediated Upregulation of Nurr1 in MN9D
Neuronal Cells Next, we were interested in identifying the
mechanism of gemfibrozil-mediated Nurr1 expression. First,
we checked the promoter of Nurr1 gene at the chromosome 2
with the help of MatInspector promoter screening tool of
Genomatix Inc. Since gemfibrozil is a well-known pharmacological agonist of PPARα, we checked the Nurr1 promoter for
PPARα-responsive element (PPRE). Based on the matrix
matching factor and bit score analyses, the Nurr1 promoter
harbors a single conserved PPRE site spanning positions −
439 to − 461, suggesting that PPARα might play an important
role in the transcription of Nurr1. First, we examined if gemfibrozil was capable of activating PPAR in DA neuronal cells.
As evident from Fig. 4a, gemfibrozil dose-dependently induced PPRE-driven luciferase activity in MN9D neuronal
cells. Next, we investigated whether PPARα was involved
in gemfibrozil-mediated Nurr1 expression in MN9D neuronal
cells. Recently, we have observed that disruption of the
ligand-binding domain of PPARα by mutating the tyrosine
at position 464 to aspartic acid (Y464D) suppresses the function PPARα [22]. Therefore, MN9D cells were transduced
with lenti-Y464D-PPARα-e-GFP followed by gemfibrozil
treatment. Lenti-e-GFP was used as control and to calculate
transduction efficiency. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 4b)
and quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 4c) results clearly indicate that disrupting PPARα LBD by lenti-Y464D-PPARα
significantly abrogated gemfibrozil-mediated Nurr1 expression in MN9D cells. On the other hand, lenti-eGFP
remained unable to inhibit gemfibrozil-mediated Nurr1
expression (Fig. 4b, c).
In order to investigate the relative contribution of PPARβ
and PPARγ, we performed a series of isoform-specific chemical inhibition studies to block their activity in MN9D cells.
As expected, gemfibrozil-treated cells that were not subjected
to GSK0060, a specific inhibitor of PPARβ, displayed a significant increase in Nurr1 expression (Fig. 4d, e). However,
GSK0060 remained unable to inhibit gemfibrozil-induced
Nurr1 expression (Fig. 4d, e). The same experimental setup
was replicated to investigate whether gemfibrozilmediated Nurr1 expression was reduced in the presence
of GW9662, a specific inhibitor of PPARγ. Similar to
GSK0060, GW9662, at different doses tested, also did
not inhibit gemfibrozil-induced Nurr1 expression in
MN9D neuronal cells (Fig. 4f, g).
Gemfibrozil Increases Nurr1 in WT, but Not PPARα−/−, Primary
Dopaminergic Neurons To confirm the role of PPARα, next we
compared the gemfibrozil-mediated expression of Nurr1 between wild-type and PPARα−/− DA neurons. Briefly, we dissected ventral midbrain tissue of E14.5 fetal brains from both
wild-type and PPARα−/− mice, cultured for primary DA neurons and then after 1 week of primary culture, treated with

Mol Neurobiol

gemfibrozil under serum-free condition. Immunocytochemical
analysis of primary DA neurons showed that gemfibrozil markedly increased Nurr1 protein expression in WT neurons
(Fig. 5a, b). Western blot analysis of pooled cell lysate
complimented our IF studies, and densitometric analysis of
immunoblots confirmed a significant increase in Nurr1 protein
levels (Fig. 5c, d) by gemfibrozil. Interestingly, Nurr1 expression was not significantly changed when gemfibrozil treatment
was carried out in primary DA neurons harvested from
PPARα−/− animals (Fig. 5a–d). These results indicate that gemfibrozil increases the level of Nurr1 in DA neurons via PPARα.
Over-expression of PPARα Restores the Ability of Gemfibrozil
in Stimulating the Level of Nurr1 in PPARα−/− DA Neurons To
further confirm the involvement of PPARα in gemfibrozilmediated Nurr1 expression, we over-expressed full-length
PPARα in primary DA neurons isolated from PPARα−/− mice.
PPARα−/− DA neurons transduced with lenti-eGFP and treated with 10 μm of gemfibrozil did not display Nurr1 upregulation as compared to untreated cells (Fig. 6a). MFI calculations (Fig. 6b) confirm no significant increase of Nurr1 expression after adjusting for cell size and background fluorescence. Interestingly, however, PPARα−/− DA neurons transduced with lenti-FL-PPARα and treated with 10 μM of gemfibrozil showed a significant increase in Nurr1 expression as
compared to untreated cells (Fig. 6c, d). These results indicate
that the reinsertion of FL-PPARα re-establishes gemfibrozilmediated Nurr1 expression in primary DA neurons isolated
from PPARα−/− fetuses. Our previous findings indicated that
disrupting the LBD of PPARα via the transduction of the
Y464D lentiviral construct prevented gemfibrozil-mediated
nurr1 expression in MN9D cells. In order to confirm this finding in primary DA neurons, WT DA neurons were transduced
with either lenti-Y464D-PPARα for 24 h. Similar to MN9D
cells, gemfibrozil treatment remained unable to induce Nurr1
expression in lenti-Y464D-PPARα-transduced WT DA neurons (Fig. 6e, f).
Gemfibrozil Increases Nurr1 Protein In Vivo in the Nigra of
WT, but Not PPARα−/−, Mice Next, we examined whether gemfibrozil was capable of upregulating Nurr1 in vivo in the nigra.
Gemfibrozil’s favorable oral bioavailability allowed us to hypothesize that oral gemfibrozil at human equivalent dose
(600 mg/adult/day = ~7.5 mg/kg/day) might upregulate
Nurr1 expression in vivo in the SNpc. Oral administration of
gemfibrozil markedly increased the level of Nurr1 in the nigra
compared to vehicle treatment (Fig. 7a, b). MFI calculations
indicate a significant increase in Nurr1 signal (Fig. 7e).
Increased Nurr1 expression from the WT gemfibrozil-fed
group is further represented by the corresponding immunoblot
(Fig. 7f) and significance quantified via densitometric analysis
(Fig. 7g, left). These results indicate that oral administration of
human equivalent dose of gemfibrozil significantly increases

nigral Nurr1 expression in mice. However, consistent to our
cell culture data, gemfibrozil treatment remained unable to
increase Nurr1 in the nigra of PPARα−/− animals as compared
to vehicle treatment (Fig. 7c–g).
Gemfibrozil Treatment Stimulated the Recruitment of PPARα
to the Nurr1 Gene Promoter Next, to understand whether
PPARα was directly involved in the transcription of Nurr1
gene, we examined the recruitment of PPARα to the Nurr1
gene promoter by ChIP assay. The Nurr1 promoter harbors a
consensus PPRE spanning positions − 461 to − 439 (Fig. 8g).
Cells were treated with 10 μM gemfibrozil for 2 h and after
immunoprecipitation of gemfibrozil-treated neuronal chromatin fragments using antibodies against PPARα, we amplified
120-bp fragment from the Nurr1 promoter (Fig. 8a, b). On the
other hand, after immunoprecipitation of chromatin fragments
with antibodies against PPARβ and PPARγ, we did not see
any amplification product (Fig. 8a–d). However, consistent to
the recruitment of PPARα to the PPRE, gemfibrozil was able
to recruit RNA polymerase to the Nurr1 gene promoter (Fig.
8a, e). These results are specific as no amplification product
was observed in immuno-precipitates obtained with control
IgG (Fig. 8f). These results demonstrate that gemfibrozil treatment is capable of stimulating the recruitment of PPARα, but
neither PPARβ nor PPARγ, to Nurr1 gene promoter in dopaminergic neuronal cells.

Discussion
Nurr1 is a master regulator of DA neuronal development before birth and maintenance throughout life [30, 31]. The dimerization of Nurr1-RXR positively induces the expression of
DA genes required for the production of dopamine including
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and l-aromatic
amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) [5, 10, 32–35].
Mutations in Nurr1 and related genes have been associated
with a small minority of late-onset genetic PD patients and
neurological disorders such as schizophrenia [36–38]. More
broadly, and perhaps more importantly however, Nurr1 protein expression is reported to be decreased in the brains of
sporadic PD patients [39–41]. This decreased Nurr1 expression was particularly evident in neurons containing Lewy bodies, which are hallmark pathologies of PD [14]. In animal
models, Nurr1 has been reported to be expressed in astrocytes
and microglia. Reduced Nurr1 levels in these cells have been
reported to increase the expression of their neurodegenerative
phenotypes [42, 43]. Expansive literature supports the notion
of an increased presence of activated microglia and α-syn
aggregation in postmortem PD tissue [44]. Nurr1’s ability to
reduce these pathogenic species of activated microglia and
astrocytes is thought to be derived through its direct blockade

Mol Neurobiol

Fig. 6 Over-expression of PPARα restores Nurr1-upregulating efficacy
of gemfibrozil in PPARα−/− DA neurons. Primary DA neurons harvested
from PPARα−/− mice were transduced with lenti-empty vector e-GFP (a,
b), lenti-full-length PPARα (c, d), or lenti-Y464D PPARα (e, f) for 24 h.
Then cells were treated with 10 μM of gemfibrozil for 18 h followed by
immunolabeling for Nurr1 (Cy5; red). MFI of Nurr1-ir was quantified for
an average of 800 cells per group (b lenti-eGFP; d lenti-FL PPARα; f

lenti-Y464D PPARα). A paired t test was utilized to compare significant
differences from the means of these two groups resulting in t = 0.448710;
p = 0.66 (b). An unpaired t test analysis was performed to show significant differences between the means (t = 11.8110; = p < 0.0003) (d).
Unpaired t test shows t = 0.2910; p = 0.77 (f). All results are mean ± SD
of three independent experiments

of NF-κB-P65 and induction of the CoREST repressor complex, thereby decreasing IL-6 production from T cells in animal models [45, 46]. Nurr1 has also been shown to a critical
regulator of Ret-c signaling expression in DA neurons that has
been reported to upregulate GDNF and TH expression in vivo
[47]. Trophic factors such as GDNF drive the formation and
maintenance of neuronal synapses and, in addition, provide
critical support to glutamate absorbing astrocytes, thereby reducing glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Animal models of

PD such as the A53T overexpressing α-syn derive their pathology from inflammation produced by activated microglia
in response to LB production [48]. Nurr1 induction has been
shown to decrease the production of proinflammatory CNSderived immune cells. In addition, it is reported that α-syn
aggregates induce the downregulation of Nurr1 which then
disrupts GDNF signaling between DA neurons [14]. The induction of Nurr1 achieves a reduction in inflammatory-prone
glial populations regardless of insult.

Fig. 7 Oral administration of gemfibrozil increases Nurr1 expression
in vivo in nigra via PPARα. WT (a, b) and PPARα−/− (c, d) animals
were gavage fed 7.5 mg/kg gemfibrozil or 0.5% methyl cellulose (Veh)
for 14 days via oral route. After that, nigral sections were double-labeled
with anti-mouse TH (cy2) and anti-rabbit Nurr1 (cy5) antibodies. Total
n = 5 animals were used per group. e MFI analysis of nigral sections
indicates a significant difference between genotypes [(F(3,23) = 233.55 >

Fc = 3.287); *** = p < 0.0003]. f Representative immunoblots using isolated nigral sections from both WT and PPARα−/− animals in this experimental paradigm. g Densitometric analysis of f indicates a significant
increase in Nurr1 protein expression from WT, but not PPARα−/− animals
fed GEM as shown by a two-way ANOVA [(F(3, 11) = 20.01 > Fc =
4.757); ***p < 0.0003]

Therefore, agonists of Nurr1 are being considered for clinical trials in PD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Here,
we report for the first time that gemfibrozil, a drug approved
by the FDA over 30 years ago and prescribed to millions of
patients for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, increases

the expression of Nurr1 in dopaminergic neurons. This result
was specific as gemfibrozil did not stimulate the expression of
Nur77 and Nor1, other members of the Nurr gene family.
Moreover, gemfibrozil was able to upregulate Nurr1 in
MPP+-challenged dopaminergic neuronal cells. These studies

Fig. 8 Gemfibrozil treatment induces the recruitment of PPARα, but
neither PPARβ nor PPARγ, to the Nurr1 gene promoter in MN9D
neuronal cells. MN9D cells were treated with 10 μM gemfibrozil for
2 h. After that, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
followed by semi-quantitative (a) and real-time (b–f) PCR of promoter
DNA as described in the BMaterials and Methods^ section. An ANOVA
analysis was used to test the significance of the mean differences between

groups and shows [(F(9,29) = 23.13 > Fc = 2.40) ** = p < 0.003)]. Post hoc
unpaired t tests indicate a significant difference in samples incubated with
antibodies to both PPARα (t = 5.654; p = 0.004) and RNA polymerase II
(t = 4.794; p = 0.008). g A schema depicts a detailed map of promoter
analysis of nurr1 gene. The map reveals a conserved PPAR-responsive
element (PPRE) in the promoter of Nurr1 gene at − 439 to − 461 upstream of the Nurr1 start site on chromosome II

provide a potentially important mechanism to reduce nigral
inflammation and maintain the health of nigral neurons by
gemfibrozil.
Mechanisms by which the Nurr1 gene is upregulated are
poorly understood. PPARα, a nuclear hormone receptor family transcription factor, is known to control the metabolism of
fatty acids in the liver. We [23, 25, 49, 50] and others [51] have
demonstrated that PPARα is also present in different parts of
the brain. Several lines of evidence presented in this manuscript describe that gemfibrozil upregulates the transcription
of Nurr1 via PPARα. First, the promoter of Nurr1 harbors a
consensus PPRE. Second, gemfibrozil treatment induced the
activation of PPAR in DA neuronal cells. Third, lentiviral
over-expression of a dominant-negative mutant (Y464D) of
PPARα abrogated gemfibrozil-mediated upregulation of
Nurr1 in DA neuronal cells and primary DA neurons.
Fourth, gemfibrozil was unable to stimulate the expression
of Nurr1 in primary DA neurons isolated from PPARα−/−
mice. Fifth, Nurr1 mRNA expression was not affected in
gemfibrozil-treated cells upon the inhibition of either

PPARβ or PPARγ. Sixth, after lentiviral over-expression of
full-length PPARα, gemfibrozil was able to upregulate Nurr1
in PPARα−/− DA neurons. Seventh, similar to cell culture
findings, oral administration of gemfibrozil led to significant
increase in Nurr1 in the nigra of WT, but not PPARα−/−, mice.
Eight, gemfibrozil induced the recruitment of PPARα to the
Nurr1 gene promoter in DA neuronal cells. Therefore,
PPARα plays a key role in the upregulation of Nurr1 in DA
neuronal cells.
It has been shown that gemfibrozil and other fibrate drugs
are capable of reducing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation
products [52, 53]. Fibrate drugs are also reported to strengthen
the cellular defense machinery by stimulating the activity of
anti-oxidant proteins such as superoxide dismutase, catalase,
and paraoxonase [54, 55]. It also could be associated with the
free radical scavenging ability and metal ion chelation. We
have seen while gemfibrozil is capable of upregulating antiinflammatory molecules like IκBα, IL-1ra, and SOCS3 [24,
27, 56], it also suppresses the expression of proinflammatory
molecules [26] in glial cells. Moreover, gemfibrozil is capable

Mol Neurobiol

of stimulating the production of neurotrophic factors from
glial cells [25]. Therefore, apart from its lipid-lowering effects,
gemfibrozil also possesses anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-oxidative properties. Since PD is associated
with increased oxidative stress, elevated neuroinflammation,
and decrease in neurotrophic factors [57], treatment with gemfibrozil will not only lead to the upregulation of Nurr1 leading
to increased survival of DA neurons but also can be beneficial
via its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neurotrophic
properties.
