The retinoid X receptor (RXR) is essential as a common heterodimerization partner of several nuclear
receptors (NRs). However, its function as a bona fide receptor for endogenous ligands has remained poorly
understood. Such a role would depend on the existence of RXR activating ligands in vivo and on the ability of
such ligands to influence relevant biological functions. Here we demonstrate the presence of endogenous RXR
ligands in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) and show that they can activate heterodimers formed
between RXR and the orphan NR Nurr1 in vivo. Moreover, RXR ligands increase the number of surviving
dopaminergic cells and other neurons in a process mediated by Nurr1–RXR heterodimers. These results
provide evidence for a role of Nurr1 as a ligand-independent partner of RXR in its function as a bona fide
ligand-activated NR. Finally, our findings identify RXR–Nurr1 heterodimers as a potential target in the
treatment of neurodegenerative disease.

Nuclear receptors (NRs) constitute a conserved family of
ligand-activated transcription factors including receptors
for estrogen, thyroid hormone, vitamin D, and retinoids,
but also a large group of receptors lacking identified ligands, referred to as orphan receptors (Giguère 1999;
Aranda and Pascual 2001). Several NRs, including, for
example, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and thyroid
hormone receptor, require heterodimerization with the
common partner the retinoid X receptor, or RXR
(NR2B1-3), for efficient DNA binding and function in
response to their cognate ligands (Mangelsdorf et al.
1990; Mangelsdorf and Evans 1995). RXR can also bind
ligands such as 9-cis-retinoic acid (9cis RA) and fatty
acids including the brain-enriched docosahexanoic acid
(DHA; Mangelsdorf and Evans 1995; Mata de Urquiza et
al. 2000). However, given its essential function as a heterodimerization partner/cofactor, it has remained possible that RXR’s only role might be to provide silent
support to other members of the NR family, and definitive evidence for a function as a true “signaling” NR in
vivo has so far been lacking.

The possibility that RXR may be activated by endogenous ligands also raises questions concerning the identity of relevant RXR partners in such signaling events.
RXR is unable to respond to cognate RXR ligands in several so-called nonpermissive heterodimers (Mangelsdorf
and Evans 1995; Germain et al. 2002). However, ligand
activation can occur in “permissive” heterodimeric
complexes with other NRs (Mangelsdorf and Evans
1995). The orphan NR Nurr1 (NR4A2) forms heterodimers with RXR that are robustly activated by RXR
ligands (Law et al. 1992; Forman et al. 1995; Perlmann
and Jansson 1995), but can also bind to specific DNAbinding sites either as monomers or homodimers and
function as a constitutively active transcription factor
(Wilson et al. 1993; Philips et al. 1997). Interestingly,
Nurr1 lacks a cavity for ligand binding as revealed from
the recently solved X-ray crystal structure of the Nurr1
ligand binding domain (LBD; Wang et al. 2003). Nurr1 is
thus distinct from other known RXR partners, which are
all capable of binding cognate ligands.
Nurr1 is almost exclusively confined to the central
nervous system (CNS) and is essential for the development of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons (Zetterström
et al. 1997; Castillo et al. 1998; Saucedo-Cardenas et al.
1998; Le et al. 1999a; Wallén et al. 1999). In addition,
analyses of Nurr1 heterozygous mutant mice show that
DA neurons from these animals are more vulnerable to
toxic stress compared with wild-type animals, indicating

that Nurr1 has a role in neuroprotection of mature DA
cells (Le et al. 1999b; Eells et al. 2002). Indeed, recent
identification of mutations in the human Nurr1 gene in
familial cases of Parkinson’s disease have provided clinically relevant evidence for such a role (Le et al. 2003).
Nurr1 is not only expressed in developing and mature
DA neurons but is also localized to several additional
brain areas including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (Zetterström et al. 1996a,b). In addition, Nurr1 and
its highly homologous family members NGFI-B (NR4A1)
and Nor1 (NR4A3) can be rapidly induced by various
stimuli, including hypoxic/ischemic stress and kainic
acid-induced excitotoxicity (Law et al. 1992; NeumannHaefelin et al. 1994; Lin et al. 1996; Crispino et al. 1998;
Honkaniemi and Sharp 1999; Johansson et al. 2000). It
seems likely, therefore, that Nurr1 functions in neuroprotection and/or other neuronal processes are not limited to dopaminergic cells.
Here we provide evidence showing that RXR is active
in Nurr1–RXR heterodimers in the developing CNS in
vivo. Moreover, regions in which Nurr1–RXR heterodimers are active contain endogenous RXR ligand activities. Finally, in experiments using neuronal primary
cultures, we reveal that RXR ligands increase the number of surviving DA cells via a mechanism that requires
ligand binding to RXR in Nurr1–RXR heterodimers.
Thus, these findings provide evidence for active RXR

signaling in vivo, demonstrate a functional role for
Nurr1 as a ligand-independent partner of RXR, and suggest a role of RXR ligands in neuronal cell survival.
Results
Endogenous RXR ligands in the embryonic CNS
We have previously used transgenic mice to assess activation of NR LBDs in vivo as a strategy to facilitate
characterization of ligand distribution and NR function
(Solomin et al. 1998; Mata de Urquiza et al. 1999). To
analyze the activity of the Nurr1 LBD in vivo, a DNA
sequence encoding a fusion protein of the Nurr1 LBD
fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4 was cloned into a transgenic vector also
containing a LacZ reporter with upstream Gal4-binding
sites . In transgenic mice, this approach allows analysis
by X-gal staining of sites in vivo where Gal4–Nurr1 is
active and thereby inducing the LacZ reporter gene. XGal staining of transgenic embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5)
embryos revealed robust LacZ expression in several regions of the CNS including the cerebral cortex, medulla
oblongata, spinal cord, and in the ventral midbrain
(VMB) where DA neurons develop (Fig. 1A; data not
shown). Moreover, staining was also seen in the proximal parts of the developing limbs (data not shown).

Coronal sections through the midbrain revealed LacZ
staining in both the ventricular and mantle zones of the
VMB. Staining correlated with that of Nurr1 mRNA expression and TH immunoreactivity (IR) in the mantle
zone, suggesting that Gal4–Nurr1 was active in developing DA neurons (Fig. 1A). Within the ventricular zone,
staining was localized to a domain expressing Aldh1a1,
an aldehydrogenase previously shown to be expressed in
proliferating DA progenitor cells as well as in maturing
postmitotic DA neurons (Fig. 1A; Wallén et al. 1999).
Next, we asked if Gal4–Nurr1 activation required heterodimerization with RXR. A mutation in the LBD of
Nurr1 (P560A) has previously been described and shown
to disrupt dimerization with RXR (Aarnisalo et al. 2002).
This mutation does not disrupt other functions such as
DNA binding or the ability of the Nurr1 LBD to promote
transcriptional activation in certain cell lines (Aarnisalo
et al. 2002). The mutation was introduced in Gal4–Nurr1
to generate the dimerization-deficient derivative Gal4–
Nurr1dim. Strikingly, in Gal4–Nurr1dim transgenic embryos, the CNS was not stained by X-gal, although staining similar to that observed in Gal4–Nurr1 embryos was
detected in the limbs (Fig. 1B; data not shown). Nine out
of 19 (47%) Gal4–Nurr1 and 0 out of 17 (0%) Gal4–
Nurr1dim embryos showed X-gal staining in the CNS.
Because all these embryos represent independent transgenic integration events, the data clearly demonstrate
that in E11.5 CNS, activation of Gal4–Nurr1 is entirely
dependent on dimerization with RXR.
The results suggest that CNS activation of Gal4–
Nurr1 might depend on ligand-mediated activation of
the heterodimerization partner RXR. Indeed, reporter
gene analysis in cell transfection experiments demonstrated that Gal4–Nurr1 functions as a sensor of RXR
ligand activation (Fig. 1C). In contrast, Gal4–Nurr1dim
was entirely inactive even when cells were treated with
high doses of RXR ligands (Fig. 1C). In conclusion, our
data suggest that Gal4–Nurr1 can be activated via RXR
in vivo and that endogenous RXR ligands are present in
several embryonic regions including the developing
VMB.
In vitro reporter gene assays were used to analyze if
embryonic VMB tissue explants, added to transfected human chorion carcinoma JEG-3 cells, contain and release
RXR ligand activity. Consistent with data in transgenic
embryos, VMB tissue activated Gal4–Nurr1 but failed to
activate Gal4–Nurr1dim (Fig. 2A). Dorsal midbrain tissue
did not activate Gal4–Nurr1, consistent with the absence of X-gal staining in this region. Importantly, the
RXR-specific antagonist LG849 (Sockanathan and Jessell
1998; Solomin et al. 1998), added together with VMB
tissue, blocked activation of the reporter gene, demonstrating that Gal4–Nurr1 activation was mediated via
heterodimerization with ligand-bound RXR (Fig. 2B).
Equal amounts of VMB tissue from stages E13.5–E15.5
were incubated with the Gal4–Nurr1-transfected reporter cells. A significant increase in activity was observed with increasing age (Fig. 2C), suggestive of an agedependent accumulation of RXR-specific ligand activity.
The endogenous RXR ligand 9cis RA activates both

RAR and RXR. A titration of 9cis RA in cells transfected
with a Gal4–RAR expression vector demonstrated efficient activation at all tested concentrations (data not
shown). In contrast, VMB tissue explants failed to activate Gal4–RAR, demonstrating that the endogenous activity was pharmacologically distinct from 9cis RA. The
same activation profile was observed for tissue explants
derived from the cortex, an additional brain area where
X-gal staining revealed Gal4–Nurr1 activity (Fig. 2D).
The tissue activity was further characterized after partial purification. Activity from ∼80 E15.5 mouse midbrains and cortices was recovered after hexane extraction
and tested in a reporter gene assay (Fig. 2E). The most
active fraction from reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; fraction #4) was reconstituted and analyzed by negative ion mass spectrometry
(Fig. 2F). The previously identified RXR ligand DHA
(Mata de Urquiza et al. 2000) was the main constituent
in this fraction (Fig. 2F). No detectable levels of 9cis RA
were observed. Additional fractions showed limited activity and contained other fatty acid derivatives but no
detectable levels of 9cisRA (data not shown). Because the
active fraction is not purified to homogeneity, the active
substance cannot be conclusively identified from these
data. However, the experiments provide additional clues
regarding its chemical properties and indicate that it is
distinct from any known retinoid derivatives.
RXR ligands increase the number of surviving
cultured DA neurons
The accumulation of RXR ligand with increasing embryonic age and their abundance in the postnatal brain suggest a possible role in maturing and postnatal neurons
(Fig. 2C; Mata de Urquiza et al. 2000). To assess the
consequences of exogenously administered RXR ligands
on VMB neuronal cells, we used primary rat cell cultures
from E14.5–E15.5 VMB, a stage when DA cell fate commitment is already determined (Hynes and Rosenthal
1999). Mesencephalic TH-positive neurons degenerate
progressively when maintained in a serum-free culture
medium, and these cultures are therefore used to assay
for survival-promoting factors (see, e.g., Hyman et al.
1991; Lin et al. 1993; Branton and Clarke 1999). DA cells
constituted ∼2%–5% of total cells in the VMB cultures
and expressed the characteristic marker genes Nurr1,
TH, and Aldh1a1 (Fig. 3A; data not shown). By treating
cells with the synthetic RXR-specific agonist LG100268
(hereafter referred to as LG268; Boehm et al. 1995; Repa
et al. 2000), a dose-dependent increase in the number of
surviving TH-positive neurons was observed, reaching
100% with the most effective concentrations 0.03 and
0.1 µM (Fig. 3B). A similar concentration-dependent increase in the number of TH-positive neurons was also
seen using a different RXR agonist (SR11237; Fig. 3B;
data not shown; Lehmann et al. 1992). The observed increase in the number of surviving DA neurons could be
due to an RXR-ligand-induced effect on neuronal proliferation rather than survival. However, the increase in
TH-positive neurons was not correlated with an in-

Figure 2. Wild-type ventral midbrain tissue activates a reporter gene assay in an RXR-dependent manner. (A,B) Excised tissue from
E12.5 dorsal and ventral midbrain of wild-type mice was placed on JEG-3 cells transiently transfected as in Fig. 1 with Gal4–Nurr1 and
Gal4–Nurr1dim expression vectors, respectively. Activity of the reporter gene was analyzed 32 h posttransfection. Actual luciferase
values vary between experiments because of differences in transfection efficiencies. Values are therefore given as “Fold activation.”
Results were consistent in at least three independent experiments. The value 1 is set as the activation obtained with indicated Gal4
constructs cotransfected with luciferase reporter but without addition of ligands or conditioned medium. (A) Ventral midbrain tissue
activates Gal4–Nurr1, whereas dorsal midbrain tissue did not result in significant reporter gene activation. Typically, E13.5 ventral
midbrain tissue activated at 10%–30% of the level achieved with 1 µM SR11237 (129-fold activation with SR11237 in the displayed
experiment). (B) Addition of the RXR-specific antagonist LG849 blocked activation by Gal4–Nurr1 in cells cultured together with
ventral midbrain tissue. (C) Reporter gene analysis of VMB activity from E13.5, E14.5, and E15.5 embryos shows that it increases with
age. Very high levels of activation are seen when E15.5-conditioned medium is administered to transfected cells. In this particular
experiment, E15.5-ventral-tissue-conditioned medium resulted in activation at levels seen with 1 µM SR11237. (D) Midbrain and
cortex tissues do not activate RAR. Activity of midbrain and cortex tissue was assayed as above in cells expressing either Gal4–RAR
or Gal4–Nurr1, respectively. (E) Partial purification of tissue-derived activity from mouse midbrain/cortex and analysis by negative ion
mass spectrometry. Hexane extract as well as the most active HPLC fraction contained activity that stimulated cotransfected
Gal4–Nurr1/RXR but not Gal4–RAR. (F) DHA was the main constituent in the most active fraction (#4). The arrow indicates the
predicted mass for 9cis RA. As seen from the diagram, no detectable levels of 9cis RA were identified in this fraction.

creased proliferation as determined by BrdU incorporation in either the absence or presence of LG268 (data not
shown). Therefore, we conclude that it was the progressive degeneration of DA neurons that was negatively influenced by RXR ligands.
The RXR-ligand-stimulated effect on DA cell number
was strikingly potent. Accordingly, SR11237 (0.1 µM)
was as efficient as glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic
factor (GDNF), a well-established dopaminotrophic factor (Lin et al. 1993), in potentiating the increase in DA
cell number, whereas LG268 (0.1 µM) was almost twice
as potent (Fig. 3C). The concentration of GDNF used in
this experiment (60 ng/mL) was shown to generate optimal survival in parallel dose-response experiments (data
not shown). The use of an RXR-specific antagonist,
LG1208 (Canan Koch et al. 1996, 1999), together with

LG268 blocked the response, thereby verifying that the
effect was due to RXR activation (Fig. 3D). To verify the
specificity of LG268 and LG1208 in neuronal cells, primary neuronal cultures were transfected with vectors
encoding Gal4–Nurr1 and Gal4–Nurr1dim together with
a Gal4-responsive luciferase reporter vector. As shown in
Figure 3E, LG268 activates Gal4–Nurr1, but not Gal4–
Nurr1dim. As predicted, LG1208 blocks this response.
Because Gal4–Nurr1 or Gal4–Nurr1dim was transfected
without expression vector encoding RXR, these results
show that endogenous RXR is available for heterodimerization with transgenic Gal4–Nurr1. In conclusion,
these results demonstrate the potential of Nurr1–RXR
heterodimers to transduce signaling by RXR ligands in
neuronal cells.
Surprisingly, when added alone, the endogenous RXR

Figure 3. RXR-specific ligands increase the number of surviving DA neurons. Primary cultures from rat ventral midbrain were
established at E14.5–E15.5, incubated for 3–5 d in the presence of various ligands, fixed, and stained for DA neuron marker expression.
Incubation in N2 media without any addition of ligand was used as control. (A) A few percent of the ventral midbrain cells are DA
neurons according to cytoplasmic expression of TH (brightfield; left panel). The TH-positive cells express Nurr1 in the nucleus and
Aldh1a1 in the cytoplasm. (B) Treatment with LG268 at 0.001–0.3 µM increases the number of TH-positive cells in a dose-dependent
manner. Similar treatments with SR11237 also result in an increase in DA neuron number. (C) The effect of SR11237 and LG268 (both
at 0.1 µM) was compared with that of GDNF (30 ng/mL). (D) Cultures were treated with LG268 alone and in combination with
LG1208, an RXR-selective antagonist. Addition of LG1208 blocked the effect of LG268. Treatment of the cultures with LG1208 alone
did not have a significant effect on the number of surviving cells. (**) p < 0.01; (***) p < 0.001. (E) To verify the activation potential
of LG268 in neuronal cells, primary cultures were transfected with Gal4–Nurr1 and a Gal4-responsive luciferase vector. Values are
given as “Fold activation,” where 1 is set as the activation obtained with Gal4–Nurr1 (or Gal4–Nurr1dim) cotransfected with the
luciferase reporter but without addition of ligands. Gal4–Nurr1 is activated by LG268, whereas the ligand is unable to activate
Gal4–Nurr1dim in neuronal cells. The RXR antagonist LG1208 completely abolished activation by LG268.

ligand 9cis RA did not affect the number of surviving DA
cells. Given that 9cis RA also activates RAR, this suggested that activation of RAR might negatively influence
the ability of RXR ligands to increase DA cell number
(Fig. 4A). Two observations corroborated this hypothesis.
First, when 9cis RA signaling via RAR was blocked by an
RAR-specific antagonist (Ro41-5253; Apfel et al. 1992), a
robust increase of surviving DA cells was observed (Fig.
4A). Second, an RAR-specific agonist TTNPB [(E)-4[2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tatramethyl-2-naphtalenyl1)
propen-1-yl)]benzoic acid] (Sporn et al. 1984) abolished
the increase in surviving DA cells when added together
with LG268 (Fig. 4B).
Next, the endogenous RXR-selective ligand DHA was
tested in the primary culture assay. Consistent with its
ability to activate RXR, treatment with DHA resulted in
a strongly increased DA cell number (Fig. 4C; >200%
increase). Importantly, the RXR-selective antagonist

LG1208 blocked the effect, confirming that the effect of
DHA was mediated via activation of RXR (Fig. 4D).
Nurr1 is essential
for RXR-ligand-dependent neuroprotection
DA neurons constitute only a minority of total neurons
in VMB cultures. To evaluate whether RXR ligands selectively stimulate survival of DA neurons, cells were
stained for a general neuronal marker (NeuN) to visualize the entire neuronal population. Notably, RXR-selective ligands did not promote a significant increase in
total neuronal number, demonstrating that the increased
survival is not general in all neuronal cell types in these
cultures (Fig. 5A,B).
As demonstrated above (Fig. 1), endogenous RXR ligands are available at sufficient levels to allow activation
of Nurr1–RXR heterodimers in vivo. In addition, as the

on DA neuron survival. (A) Treatment of

shown with 10 and 30 nM). Addition of an

the primary cultures with the RAR-specific agonist TTNPB did not increase DA

30, and 100 µM). A dose-dependent increase in the number of TH-positive cells
was observed. Addition of the RXR antagonist LG1208 (10 µM) together with DHA

of RXR in midbrain DA cells. If this assumption is correct, also non-dopaminergic Nurr1-expressing neurons
might respond to RXR ligand. To address this possibility,
primary cultures from the developing Nurr1-expressing
cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 6A) were treated with
LG268. Interestingly, the number of surviving Nurr1positive cells increased in both cortical (Fig. 6B, left
graph, 41% increase) and hippocampal cultures (Fig. 6C,
left graph, 49% increase). A corresponding increase was
not observed in Nurr1-negative cells, demonstrating that
the survival effect was specific to neurons expressing
Nurr1 (Fig. 6B,C, right graphs).
The above experiment indicated a strong correlation
between Nurr1 expression and the ability to respond to
the survival-promoting RXR-ligand-induced effect. The
involvement of Nurr1 in this process was verified by
analyzing neurons from Nurr1-gene-targeted mice. In
wild-type rat and mouse cortical primary cultures, a relatively high proportion of neurons are Nurr1-immunoreactive (Fig. 6B,C; data not shown). In line with our hypothesis that Nurr1 is essential for the increased survival, LG268 induced a significant increase in total
cortical neuronal number in primary cultures from wildtype mice as assessed by NeuN staining (Fig. 6D, left
graph), whereas no such increase in NeuN-positive cells
was detected in cortical cultures from Nurr1-gene-targeted littermates (Fig. 6D, right graph).
Although the data described above indicate that Nurr1
is essential for the ability of RXR ligands to promote
neuronal survival, it remained possible that the requirement for Nurr1 is indirect. A pharmacological approach
was used to address this possibility. Screening of a
chemical library resulted in the identification of an aminopyrimidine derivative (XCT0135908; Fig. 7A) that is

Nurr1/RXR was blocked by the addition of an RXR antagonist, indicating that the RXR subunit in these heterodimers is activated by XCT0135908 (data not shown).
In line with the results presented above, addition of the
Nurr1/RXR-selective compound XCT0135908 to primary cultures from rat VMB increased the number of
surviving DA cells whereas nondopaminergic neurons
were unaffected (Fig. 7B; data not shown). In transfection
experiments in primary neuronal cultures, XCT0135908
activated Gal4–Nurr1 but not Gal4–Nurr1dim (Fig. 7C).
As predicted, activation of Gal4–Nurr1 was blocked by
the RXR antagonist LG1208. Together these data provide
additional strong evidence substantiating that Nurr1 is
an essential heterodimer partner in RXR-ligand-induced
neuronal survival.

In its essential function as a silent heterodimerization
partner, RXR is at center stage in NR-mediated signaling. However, whether RXR functions as a ligand-binding signaling NR in vivo has remained unclear. Evidence
for such a role requires the identification of endogenous
RXR ligands that should also be available at sufficient
concentrations to allow activation of RXR. Moreover,
relevant biological activities influenced by ligand-activated RXR need to be defined. Finally, a central issue
concerns the identity of relevant RXR partner(s) in such
signaling events. Here we show that RXR ligands are
present at several locations in the embryonic CNS, and
we demonstrate that they are also available for activation of Nurr1–RXR heterodimers in vivo. Moreover,
these data indicate a functional role of RXR ligands in
neuroprotection and thus identify a novel Nurr1-dependent signaling pathway of significance in neuronal survival.

Existence of endogenous RXR ligands
RXR was initially defined as a retinoid receptor based on
its ability to become activated and bind 9cis RA (Heyman et al. 1992; Levin et al. 1992). In addition, 9cis RA
can also activate RARs. Such dual activation potential
would suggest that 9cis RA is essential in vitamin Adependent processes in vivo. Indeed, ligand activation of
both subunits in RAR–RXR heterodimers often results
in strongly synergistic effects (see, e.g., Roy et al. 1995;
Botling et al. 1997; Lu et al. 1997), and previous data have
indicated RXR activation in the embryonic spinal cord,
likely as a result of 9cis RA ligand binding (Solomin et al.
1998). Moreover, mutations introduced in the ligand-dependent activation function 2 in RXR␣ by gene targeting
in mice also suggested an active ligand-binding role of
RXR␣ in retinoid-mediated signaling (Mascrez et al.
1998). However, despite these data, the signaling status
of RXR in vivo has been a matter of debate because 9cis
RA has been difficult to detect in tissues, and specific
isomerases converting atRA into 9cis RA have not been
identified (Horton and Maden 1995; Ulven et al. 2001).

Signaling by Nurr1–RXR heterodimers

Figure 7. A Nurr1/RXR-selective ligand increases cell
survival. (A) In CV-1 cells, several Gal4–NR constructs
were cotransfected with RXR. XCT0135908 (1 µM; the
structure is shown in A) selectively increased the luciferase activity ∼37-fold when added to cells transfected
with the Gal4–Nurr1 and a full-length RXR␣ expression
vectors. Addition of this ligand did not increase the activity in cells transfected with any of the other Gal4–
NRs, including Gal4–RXR, showing that XCT0135908
is strictly selective for RXR/Nurr1 heterodimers at 1
µM. (B) Addition of 1 µM XCT0135908 to rat VMB primary cultures increased the number of surviving THpositive cells by 45% compared with N2 media. (***)
p < 0.001. (C) To verify the activation potential of
XCT0135908 in neuronal cells, primary cultures were
transfected with Gal4–Nurr1 and a Gal4-responsive luciferase vector. Values are given as “Fold activation,”
where 1 is set as the activation obtained with Gal4–
Nurr1 (or Gal4–Nurr1dim) cotransfected with luciferase
reporter but without addition of ligands. Gal4–Nurr1 is
activated by XCT0135908, whereas the ligand is unable
to activate Gal4–Nurr1dim in neuronal cells. The RXR
antagonist LG1208 completely abolished activation by
XCT0135908.

Thus, 9cis RA may be important at sites containing very
high levels of all-trans RA, for example, in the developing embryonic spinal cord, where sufficient amounts of
9cis RA can be derived from nonenzymatic atRA isomerization.
More recent findings have indicated the existence of
endogenous nonretinoid RXR-selective ligands. Phytanic
acid is a chlorophyll metabolite activating RXR, but is
probably only accumulating at sufficiently high levels to
allow activation of RXR in patients with certain metabolic disorders (Kitareewan et al. 1996; Lemotte et al.
1996). The polyunsaturated fatty acid DHA was recently
identified as a brain-derived RXR ligand (Mata de
Urquiza et al. 2000). Our more recent studies have identified additional RXR-activating fatty acid derivatives in
the brain, but also in other tissues (A. Mata de Urquiza
and T. Perlmann, unpubl.). These fatty acids are mostly
associated with membrane phospholipids, but they can
be released in free form and are in several cases highly
abundant. Thus, although the exact identity of physiologically relevant endogenous RXR ligands remains to
be established, we can conclude that RXR-selective ligands exist in tissues and, as indicated in this study,
RXR is apparently ligand activated in the embryonic
CNS. As demonstrated by partial purification, one of the
active components of E15.5 midbrain tissue was indeed
identified as DHA (Fig. 2F).
Nurr1 as a silent partner in Nurr1–RXR heterodimers
This study defines a new role of Nurr1 in RXR-ligandmediated signaling in neurons. Evidence for the involve-

ment of Nurr1 in RXR-ligand-dependent signaling is derived from several observations: (1) Nurr1-expressing
cells, but not other neurons in the VMB, cortex, and
hippocampus respond to RXR ligand treatment. (2) Cells
cultured from the cortex of Nurr1-gene-targeted mice
fail to respond to RXR ligand treatment. (3) A synthetic
compound (XCT0135908) selectively activating Nurr1–
RXR heterodimers stimulated DA neuron survival. (4)
Nurr1–RXR heterodimers can be activated in vivo, apparently as a result of RXR ligand binding, as demonstrated in our transgenic mouse experiments. Together,
these observations provide compelling evidence showing
that Nurr1–RXR heterodimers are responsible for transducing the neuroprotective effect.
Nurr1 can also bind to DNA either as monomers or
homodimers, and it seems likely that both RXR-dependent and -independent activities are essential for Nurr1
functions in vivo. For example, although previous data
indicated that Nurr1 functions independently of RXR at
early stages of DA cell development (Castro et al. 2001),
the RXR-dependent survival-promoting effect presented
here may be more relevant at later stages of brain maturation and in the postnatal brain. Such effects will remain undetected in Nurr1-null-gene-targeted mice, as
these die immediately after birth (Zetterström et al.
1997; Castillo et al. 1998; Saucedo-Cardenas et al. 1998).
Nurr1 belongs to an evolutionarily conserved subgroup of NRs that can bind DNA as monomers, homodimers, and heterodimers with RXR. Despite intense
efforts, neither synthetic nor natural compounds that
can modulate the activity of Nurr1 in an apparent liganddependent manner have been identified. The recently de-

scribed X-ray crystal structure of the LBDs of Nurr1 and
its Drosophila homolog DHR38 have explained the reason for these difficulties (Baker et al. 2003; Wang et al.
2003). Accordingly, although the Nurr1 LBD largely resembles LBDs of other NRs, it lacks a cavity for ligand
binding, thus defining Nurr1 as a ligand-independent orphan NR. This remarkable property distinguishes Nurr1
(and most likely NGFI-B) from other RXR heterodimer
partners, which all have identified ligands. We speculate
that an important ligand-independent function of Nurr1
is to function as a silent partner of RXR and thereby
indirectly promote ligand-mediated signaling in vivo.
Curiously, in such a mechanism Nurr1 resembles the
function of RXR in other heterodimers.

Nurr1 in neuroprotection
The results presented here demonstrate that Nurr1 has a
survival-promoting function in Nurr1-expressing neurons. Previous studies have provided suggestive evidence
for a neuroprotective role of Nurr1 in mature DA neurons. Compared with DA neurons derived from wildtype animals, these cells are more vulnerable in Nurr1gene-targeted heterozygous mice (Le et al. 1999b; Eells et
al. 2002; Le et al. 2003). In addition, recent genetic analyses in familial Parkinson’s patients underscored the importance of Nurr1 for the maintenance of dopaminergic
cells in the human brain (Le et al. 2003). It is important
to emphasize, however, that the results presented here
implicate Nurr1 and RXR in a more versatile neuroprotective function, as not only midbrain DA cells, but also
Nurr1-expressing neurons in the cortex and hippocampus respond to RXR ligand treatment. Given the ubiquitous expression of RXR (Mangelsdorf et al. 1992; Dolle et
al. 1994; Zetterström et al. 1999), Nurr1 availability may
thus determine the responsiveness of neurons to RXRligand-promoted survival. Nurr1 is encoded by an immediate early gene that is rapidly induced by various stressful insults including ischemia, and it is interesting to
speculate that such up-regulation in response to stressful
insults reflects a cytoprotective mechanism mediated by
Nurr1–RXR heterodimers (Law et al. 1992; Crispino et
al. 1998; Honkaniemi and Sharp 1999).

that definitive evidence for a role of RXR and endogenous RXR ligands in the adult brain remains to be provided.
A previously identified ligand that may contribute to
activation of Nurr1–RXR heterodimers in vivo is the
polyunsaturated fatty acid DHA. Of note, DHA has in
previous studies been shown to be neuroprotective
(Glozman et al. 1998; Lauritzen et al. 2000; Politi et al.
2001), and we demonstrate here that DHA has a robust
ability to increase the survival of DA neurons. An RXR
antagonist blocked this effect, supporting the hypothesis
that DHA can be neuroprotective via activation of RXR.
DHA is mainly associated with membrane phospholipids. However, it can be released as free acid, for example,
upon stressful insults such as ischemia (Neuringer et al.
1988; Baker and Chang 1992). Because Nurr1 is encoded
by an immediate early gene, it is intriguing to speculate
that both Nurr1 and endogenous RXR ligands are made
available under situations requiring engagement by
acutely induced neuroprotective mechanisms.

RXR as a target for treatment
of neurodegenerative disease
NRs have major potential as drug targets. However,
whereas several metabolic disorders are clearly amenable to NR ligand treatment (eg., via activation of
PPAR␥), much less progress has been made in understanding NR functions of potential relevance in neurological disorders. The results presented here suggest that
RXR ligand administration may provide a novel approach in treatment of neurodegenerative disease. The
high levels of Nurr1 expression in DA neurons and in
cortical and hippocampal neurons in response to hypoxic
stress (Honkaniemi and Sharp 1996) suggest that both
Parkinson’s disease and stroke may be relevant disorders
in further studies toward this goal. RXR’s versatile role
as a common heterodimer partner might increase the
risk for unwanted side effects and is a concern in any
pharmacological approach involving RXR agonists. The
unique pharmacological properties of the Nurr1–RXRspecific agonist XCT0135908 are therefore intriguing
and warrant further in vitro and in vivo studies in models of neurodegenerative disease.

Endogenous RXR ligands in neuroprotection
Are endogenous RXR ligands neuroprotective in vivo?
The apparent accumulation of RXR ligand activity during development and in the postnatal brain seems consistent with a functional role in maintenance of developing and mature neurons. Ligands that are biologically
relevant in such a neuronal survival pathway should be
selective for RXR, because RAR ligands, including the
RAR/RXR ligand 9cis RA, inhibit RXR-ligand-mediated
neuronal survival (Fig. 4). Notably, although their exact
biochemical nature remains to be determined, the endogenous ligand activities defined here fulfill this criterion because they are specific for RXR and pharmacologically distinct from 9cis RA. It should be noted, however,

Materials and methods
Tissue explants and conditioned medium
NMRI mouse embryo midbrains were dissected (dissection microscope SMZ-2T; Nikon) and either placed directly on transfected JEG3 cells or fine-dissected into separate ventral and dorsal pieces and placed on the cells. The tissue was weighed to get
equal amounts of tissue on the cells. For generation of tissueconditioned medium, tissue was excised, cut into small pieces,
and placed in serum-free minimal essential medium (MEM;
GIBCO). Incubation in cell culture incubator was overnight,
followed by centrifugation and removal of tissue. This conditioned medium was placed on transfected cells.

Signaling by Nurr1–RXR heterodimers

Tissue culture and transfections
Human choriocarcinoma JEG3 cells were transfected in triplicates with 100 ng of receptor CMX-Gal4–Nurr1, CMX-Gal4–
Nurr1dim (point mutation in LBD I-box P560A), ±100 ng of
CMX-RXR and 100 ng of Gal4-binding luciferase reporter
MH100-tk-luc using the calcium phosphate method (Perlmann
et al. 1993). In the experiment with conditioned media and titration of 9cis RA, CMX-Gal4–RAR was also used. In all experiments, CMX-␤-Gal (200 ng) was used as an internal control.
Calcium precipitate was removed by rinses 6 h posttransfection,
and relevant substances were added to cells. After 24 h, cells
were harvested and assayed for luciferase and reference ␤-galactosidase activity on a luminometer/photometer reader (Lucy-1;
Anthos).
CV-1 cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma) with 10% charcoal stripped FCS (HyClone), 50 µg/mL Gentamycin (GIBCO,
Invitrogen), and plated at 10,000 cells/well in DMEM with 5%
charcoal stripped FCS (HyClone) and 50 µg/mL Gentamycin
into 96-well plates 1 d previous to transfecting. Transfections
were carried out using FuGENE6 reagent (Roche). Briefly, 70 ng
of DNA was transfected per well with 0.25 µL of FuGENE6
reagent. For heterodimer selectivity assays, 20 ng of MH100x4tk-luciferase, 20 ng of the appropriate CMX-GAL4–LBD construct, 20 ng of CMX-RXR–LBD, and 10 ng of CMX-␤-Gal, were
transfected. The compound was added 5 h after transfection at
the concentrations indicated in the figure, and the transfection
was assayed 18 h later unless otherwise indicated. Cells were
lysed, and the luciferase activity was measured using an LJL
Analyst plate reader and normalized to ␤-galactosidase activity.
All experiments were carried out a minimum of three times.
Partial purification of tissue factor
from brain-conditioned medium
Embryonal conditioned medium was prepared using forebrain
tissue from 80 mouse embryos (E15.5) as described above. Medium was extracted using hexane as described (Mata de Urquiza
et al. 2000), reconstituted in a minimum of HPLC-mobile phase
(methanol:isopropanol:water, 80:10:10 [v/v], with 0.5% acetic
acid) and fractionated using an isocratic gradient (0.2 mL/min)
on a reverse-phase C18-column (ACE, 250 × 2.1 mm, Advanced
Chromatography Technologies). Fractions were reconstituted
in ethanol and tested for activity by adding small aliquots to
HEK293 cells transfected with effector and reporter plasmids
(Mata de Urquiza et al. 2000). Active fractions were analyzed by
negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry using a Quattro
Micro triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass).
Gal4-transgenic mice
The bicistronic UAS-hsp-gRAR/lacZ construct (Mata De
Urquiza et al. 1999) was cleaved with XhoI and NheI to replace
part of the Gal4 (g) and entire RAR–LBD cDNA with the corresponding Gal4 sequence and LBD cDNA from CMX-gNurr1 and
CMX-gNurr1dim LBDs, respectively. Constructs purified from
vector sequences (Not1 cleavage) were microinjected into pronuclei of fertilized eggs from matings of C57BL/6xCBA hybrid
mice. For the Gal4–Nurr1 wild type, seven founder lines were
established and mated to wild-type mice for generation of offspring for embryonic analyses. In addition, transient transgenic
embryos were generated. For Gal4–Nurr1dim, transient transgenic embryos only were used. In total, 19 Gal4–Nurr1 and 17
Gal4– Nurr1dim mouse lines were obtained. Embryos were dissected at E11.5, fixed for 30 min in 0.2% glutaraldehyde, followed by immersion in X-gal staining solution (2 mM MgCl2,
0.02% NP-40, 0.01% Na-deoxycholate, 5 mM K4Fe[CN]6, 5 mM
K3Fe[CN]6, and 1 mg/mL X-gal [5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-␤-D-

galactopyranoside]) overnight at 37°C. Embryos were rinsed in
PBS and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Amnion-derived
DNA was used for genotyping.
Nurr1-gene-targeted mice
Generation and genotyping of Nurr1 mutant mice was described
previously (Zetterström et al. 1997).
Histology
Coronal cryosections of Gal4–Nurr1 embryos were prepared at
14 µm thickness.
In situ hybridization histochemistry
For Nurr1 mRNA analysis, the protocol previously described
was used (Wallén et al. 1999).
Immunofluorescent histochemistry
TH (1:200; Pel-Freez) and Aldh1a1 (1:400; generous gift from R.
Lindahl, University of South Dakota, Vermillion) primary antiserum was diluted in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.5%
fetal calf serum and incubated on paraformaldehyde-fixed sections overnight at 4°C, followed by rinses in PBS and immunodetection by Cy3-conjugated IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch).
Primary cultures
VMB, hippocampus, and cortex from rat (B&K) and mouse (Zetterström et al. 1997) embryos at stage E14.5–E15.5 were dissected, mechanically dissociated, and plated on poly-D-lysinecoated 12- or 24-well plates in serum-free medium (N2) consisting of a 1:1 mixture of MEM (GIBCO) with 15 mM HEPES buffer
(GIBCO) and Ham’s F12 medium (GIBCO). The mixture was
supplemented with 6 mg/mL glucose, 1 mg/mL bovine serum
albumin, 5 µg/mL insulin, 100 µg/mL transferrin, 60 µM putrescine, 20 nM progesterone, 30 nM selenium, and 1 mM glutamine (Sigma). Ligands included stock solutions in DMSO;
9cis RA (Sigma); LG100268, LG100849, and LG1001208 (kindly
provided by Mark Leibowitz at Ligand Pharmaceuticals);
(E)-4-[2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1propenyl]benzoic acid (TTNPB), DHA (Sigma), GDNF (SigmaAldrich), SR11237 (Roche), and Ro41-5253 (kindly provided by
Louise Foley at Hoffman-LaRoche). These were diluted to working concentrations in N2 and added to cells in triplicates. Cells
were incubated 3–5 d. Paraformaldehyde-fixed cultures were incubated overnight with TH (1:1000; Pel-Freez), NeuN (1:200;
Chemicon), or Nurr1 (1:10.000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antiserum in PBS containing 0.5% (TH and NeuN) or 10% (Nurr1)
fetal calf serum and 0.3% Triton X-100. Following rinses, cultures were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody followed by detection of immunostaining using the ABC immunoperoxidase kit from Vector. Cortical primary neurons were
transfected using the Nucleofector technology and the Rat Neuron Nucleofector kit (Amaxa biosystems Gmbh) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. A total of 1.5 µg of CMX-Gal4–
Nurr1 or CMX-Gal4–Nurr1dim, ±1.5 µg of CMX-RXR and 1 µg of
MH100-tk-luc and 0.5 µg of CMX-␤-Gal were added per 6 × 106
cells; 1 × 106 cells were plated per 2-cm2 well. Ligands were
added within 4 h after plating. Cells were lysed after 18–20 h
and assayed for luciferase and reference ␤-galactosidase activity
as described above.
