Summary
+

Sir2 is an NAD -dependent deacetylase that regulates
lifespan in yeast, worms and flies. The mammalian
orthologs of Sir2 include SIRT1 in humans and mice. In this
study, we analyzed the level of SIRT1 in human lung
fibroblasts (IMR90) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs) from mice with normal, accelerated, and delayed
aging. SIRT1 protein, but not mRNA, decreased significantly with serial cell passage in both human and murine
cells. Mouse SIRT1 decreased rapidly in prematurely
senescent (p44 Tg) MEFs, remained high in MEFs with
delayed senescence (Igf-1r–/–), and was inversely correβGal)
lated with senescence-activated β-galactosidase (SA-β
activity. Reacquisition of mitotic capability following
spontaneous immortalization of serially passaged wildtype MEFs restored the level of SIRT1 to that of early
passage, highly proliferative MEFs. In mouse and human
fibroblasts, we found a significant positive correlation
between the levels of SIRT1 and proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA), a DNA processing factor expressed during
S-phase. In the animal, we found that SIRT1 decreased
with age in tissues in which mitotic activity also declines,
such as the thymus and testis, but not in tissues such as
the brain in which there is little change in mitotic activity
throughout life. Again, the decreases in SIRT1 were highly
correlated with decreases in PCNA. Finally, loss of SIRT1
with age was accelerated in mice with accelerated aging
but was not observed in long-lived growth hormonereceptor knockout mice. Thus, as mitotic activity ceases
in mouse and human cells in the normal environment of
the animal or in the culture dish, there is a concomitant
decline in the level of SIRT1.

Introduction
Cellular senescence, which refers to the process by which
primary cells in culture lose their ability to divide, has been a
useful model for the study of mammalian aging for decades
(Hayflick & Moorhead, 1961); yet not all or even most of the
molecular details by which this process occurs are known.
Cellular senescence appears to parallel organismal aging,
and cells from mice or humans with various premature aging
syndromes undergo senescence in culture more rapidly than
do cells from normal mice or humans (Lombard et al., 2005).
How, or even if, cellular senescence contributes to organismal
aging, however, is not known. Senescent cells accumulate in
vivo as the organism ages, as well as at sites of pathology
(Itahana et al., 2004). One theory holds that senescence of stem
or progenitor cells impairs tissue renewal, limiting the ability
of the organism to replace cells that die or wear out with time
and leading to the deterioration of the body and frailty we
associate with old age.
+
One molecule that is known to affect senescence is the NAD dependent deacetylase Sir2 (Imai et al., 2000; Landry et al.,
2000; Smith et al., 2000). Although first identified in yeast as
a gene involved in mating type switching (Rine & Herskowitz,
1987), the SIR2 gene is highly conserved in organisms ranging
from archea to humans (Brachmann et al., 1995), where its role
is much broader. Overexpression of Sir2 extends replicative
lifespan in yeast (Kaeberlein et al., 1999), and Sir2 orthologs
extend organismal lifespan in both worms (Tissenbaum &
Guarente, 2001) and flies (Rogina & Helfand, 2004).
Of the seven Sir2 family homologues (sirtuins) in humans
(Frye, 1999, 2000), SIRT1 is the most closely related to Sir2 of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Frye, 2000). In contrast to yeast,
SIRT1 was found not to extend replicative lifespan when
overexpressed in human fibroblasts or epithelial cells under
standard culture conditions (Michishita et al., 2005), and deletion
of the normal allele of Sirt1 from heterozygous Sirt1 +/–
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in culture dramatically
increased replicative lifespan (Chua et al., 2005). Thus, how
SIRT1 is involved in mammalian replicative senescence remains
unclear.
Observations from a number of organisms showing that
changes in Sir2 expression accompany changes in the ability of
cells to divide, led us to explore this link in greater detail. We
examined the levels of the mammalian Sir2 ortholog, SIRT1,
under conditions that alter mitotic activity both in vitro and
in vivo. The results of this study imply that mammalian SIRT1
might interact with the cell cycle on multiple levels.

Results
The level of SIRT1 decreases with serial cell passage
as cells stop dividing
Replicative lifespan in yeast cells is sensitive to the dosage of
SIR2 (Kaeberlein et al., 1999). In order to determine if such a
relationship exists in mammalian cells, we analyzed the level
of SIRT1 in human and murine cells during serial cell passage.
Human lung fibroblasts (IMR90) were serially passaged at a
ratio of 1 : 8 in 10-cm plates, and protein levels determined by
Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A, as the number of
population doublings of IMR90 cells increased, there was
progressively less SIRT1 in the extracts. Similarly, in normal
MEFs passaged at a ratio of 1 : 4 in 10-cm plates, the level of
SIRT1 decreased with increasing passage number in MEFs
prepared from two different strains of mice (Fig. 1B, ICR, and
Fig. 1C, B6).
We next determined if the level of SIRT1 in murine cells in
which senescence is accelerated or delayed relative to normal
declined at a faster or slower rate, respectively. In MEFs from
p44 transgenic mice, which express a short isoform of p53 (p44)
and senesce more rapidly than normal MEFs (Maier et al., 2004),
the rate at which SIRT1 levels declined was more rapid than in

nontransgenic MEFs of the same strain (ICR) (Fig. 1B, compare
ICR to p44+/+). These observations were confirmed in two independent serial cell passage experiments. Conversely, MEFs
that senesce more slowly in culture showed little decline in SIRT1
levels with passage number. Igf-1r–/– MEFs, for example, were
serially passaged at a ratio of 1 : 4 until passage 4, then at a ratio
of 1 : 8. These cells did not undergo any of the changes associated
with senescence, such as cell flattening and enlargement, even
after approximately 34 population doublings (passage 12; data
not shown). As shown in Fig. 1C, they also showed little if any
decline in SIRT1 compared to normal MEFs of the same strain
(C57Bl6).
To get a rough estimate of how mitotically active the cells
were at each successive passage, we determined the level of a
DNA polymerase processing factor, proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA), in the same extracts used for SIRT1 determination. We found a significant linear correlation between
levels of SIRT1 and PCNA [Fig. 1A–D, F-test, (A), P < 0.05; (B),
P < 0.001; (C), P < 0.001; (D), P < 0.01]. We were able to
confirm this observation in MEFs that underwent spontaneous
immortalization in culture. Following a decline in both SIRT1 and
PCNA levels between passage 0 and passage 3, the amounts
of both proteins began to increase, reaching presenescence
levels again at about passage 6 (Fig. 1D).

SIRT1 is regulated at the protein, not the RNA, level
The observed decline in the level of SIRT1 could have been
caused by changes at the transcriptional level or the posttranscriptional level. To distinguish between these possibilities,
we analyzed the levels of SIRT1 mRNA in serially passaged cells.
The results are shown in Fig. 2 for IMR90 cells (A), normal ICR
MEFs (B), and p44 transgenic MEFs (C). In contrast to protein
levels, the level of SIRT1 mRNA did not decrease significantly
with passage [IMR90 cells (A): F-test, P > 0.1 for correlation
between population doubling and SIRT1 mRNA level; ICR MEFs
(B): t-test, P > 0.1 between passage 0 and 3; and p44+/+
transgenic MEFs (C): t-test, P > 0.05 between passage 0 and 2].
Furthermore, when we compared protein levels in IMR90
cells (Fig. 1A) to mRNA levels (Fig. 2A), we did not find a significant linear correlation between the two (Fig. 2D: F-test,
P > 0.1). Thus, the changes in the level of SIRT1 protein occur
post-transcriptionally.

The level of SIRT1 increases when cells are stimulated
to divide
Based on our findings with cells subjected to serial cell passage,
we hypothesized that the level of SIRT1 protein in a cell might
be linked to its mitotic activity. In order to test this hypothesis,
we cultured IMR90 human lung fibroblasts (Fig. 3A) and normal
C57Bl6 MEFs (Fig. 3B) under different serum concentrations.
Both SIRT1 and PCNA increased when cells were stimulated with
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and compared to nonstimulated cells.
However, SIRT1 appeared to be more sensitive to serum concentration, reaching maximal induction at a lower concentration
than that needed for maximal PCNA induction. When cells were
treated with aphidicolin, a DNA polymerase inhibitor that
should block cells in S-phase, the level of SIRT1 did not go up
with serum stimulation (Fig. 3C). At the same time, the increase
in PCNA level indicated that cells had entered S-phase prior to
the block.

SIRT1 decreases specifically in cells that stop dividing
Next, we used histochemical techniques to correlate loss of
SIRT1 with the onset of senescence in populations of normal
cells undergoing successive cell divisions in culture. Cells with
prominent senescence-activated β-galactosidase (SA-βGal)
activity (Fig. 4, arrowheads, left panel) did not react with an
antibody against SIRT1 (middle panel), while cells that showed
only slight SA-βGal activity (Fig. 4, arrows) retained some SIRT1
reactivity, and cells that showed no SA-βGal activity showed
high SIRT1 reactivity. Thus, the decrease in SIRT1 with senescence
can be attributed to a decrease in the population of cells that
continue to proliferate rather than an overall decrease in SIRT1
expression in all cells.
In summary, these data indicate that the level of SIRT1 in
mammalian cells both correlates positively with mitotic activity
and decreases with replicative senescence.

(*) indicates significant difference between two groups (t-test, P < 0.05). In (C), an anti-SIRT1 monoclonal antibody was used.

SIRT1 and mitotic activity are coupled in tissues and
decline in parallel during aging
In humans and mice, mitotic activity is higher in tissues that have
a greater demand for regeneration and cell replacement than
in tissues that undergo relatively little cell replacement. The rates
of mitotic activity also change as the organism ages. We measured the levels of SIRT1 in an organ that undergoes little cell
replacement (brain), and in two organs in which the demand
for cell replacement is high (thymus and testis). We compared
the level of SIRT1 in tissues from young adult mice (4 months
of age) to those of older mice (12, 18, and 24 months of age)
using Western blot analysis with antibodies against N- and
C-terminal regions of SIRT1. In the brain, which consists mainly

of postmitotic neurons and glial cells that remain capable of
proliferation, there was no consistent change in SIRT1 level with
age (Fig. 5A). The slight increase in PCNA signal may in fact
reflect this glial cell mitotic activity. In all, there was no significant linear correlation between the levels of SIRT1 and PCNA
in brain (F-test, P > 0.1). In the testis, where the seminiferous
epithelium remains highly mitotically active throughout most of
adulthood, the level of SIRT1 was maintained at a relatively
constant level, with some decline observed in the oldest animals
(Fig. 5B). This relatively persistent mitotic activity is reflected in
the levels of PCNA, which were significantly correlated to the
levels of SIRT1 at all ages (Fig. 5B: F-test, P < 0.001). In contrast,
both SIRT1 and PCNA levels decreased significantly with age in
the thymus (Fig. 5C). The decline in PCNA reflects the decreased

mitotic activity of thymocytes during regression of the thymus,
which occurs in adult animals (Taub & Longo, 2005). There was
also significant linear correlation between SIRT1 and PCNA
levels in thymus (F-test, P < 0.001).
To determine if these changes in SIRT1 protein level in tissues
were due to changes in SIRT1 transcription, we measured the
level of SIRT1 mRNA in the same brain, testis and thymus samples
using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase
chain reaction (RT–PCR). We found no significant correlation
between the amount of SIRT1 transcript and the age of the
animal for any of the tissues tested (F-test, P > 0.1). We also
did not find any significant linear correlation between the
levels of SIRT1 mRNA and protein among tissues examined
(F-test, P > 0.1). These results, which are presented in Fig. 6,
are consistent with similar findings in cultured cells shown in
Fig. 2.

As a final test of the link between the level of SIRT1 and mitotic
activity, we utilized two mouse models of aging, the p44 transgenic mouse, which exhibits accelerated aging, and the growth
hormone-receptor knockout (GHRKO) mouse, in which aging
is delayed. In the accelerated aging model, we found that SIRT1
in the testis of p44 transgenic mice decreased to a greater extent
and in younger animals than in nontransgenic mice of the same
strain (ICR) (Fig. 7A). This is consistent with the premature reproductive senescence and decreased spermatogenesis seen in
these mice (Maier et al., 2004). SIRT1 levels in the thymus of
p44 transgenic mice also decreased at younger ages than in
nontransgenic mice (Fig. 7C).
In the GHRKO mice, on the other hand, and in their normal
littermates, we found that SIRT1 and PCNA levels were maintained in the testes with age (Fig. 7B). In the thymus, however,
SIRT1 levels declined with age in both GHRKO mice and normal
littermates, and there was no difference in the rate of SIRT1
decline between two groups (Fig. 7D). Significant linear correlations between the levels of SIRT1 and PCNA were observed
in the thymus (F-test, P < 0.05 in Fig. 7C, P < 0.005 in Fig. 7D).
There was no significant linear correlation between the levels
of SIRT1 and PCNA in testis.
These data from tissues from normally aging mice and from
mutant mice in which the rate of aging is disturbed reinforce
the observation that the loss of SIRT1 is directly proportional to
the loss of mitotic activity, and are the in vivo equivalent of data
obtained using cells undergoing replicative senescence in culture.

testis (B), and thymus (C). Densitometry results for each blot are shown on the right. There was a significant decrease in testis (F-test, P < 0.02) and thymus
(F-test, P < 0.005). The brain blot showed an age-dependent increase in SIRT1 with the anti-N-terminal SIRT1 antibody, but not with the anti-C-terminal SIRT1
antibody. Age-dependent changes in SIRT1 in testis and thymus were seen with both anti-N- and C-terminal SIRT1 antibodies. Each data point represents an
average of the samples from the same age, with error bars representing the standard deviations among samples. There were significant linear correlations
between levels of SIRT1 and PCNA in testis and thymus (F-test, P < 0.001), but not in brain (F-test, P > 0.1). mo, month old.

Discussion
In this study, we have explored the relationship between
changes in the level of the mammalian homologues of Sir2,
SIRT1 and Sirt1, and changes in mitotic activities of cells undergoing senescence in culture or as a consequence of the aging
process in the animal. When we began this study, we thought
that the most likely effect of SIRT1 would be to facilitate mitosis
via a pathway upstream of cell cycle entry. This assumption was
based largely on the effects of calorie restriction or nutrient
withdrawal on the level of SIRT1 expression (Cohen et al., 2004;
Nemoto et al., 2004; Rodgers et al., 2005), and on the effect of
SIRT1 on cell survival under conditions that evoke a p53 response
(Luo et al., 2001; Vaziri et al., 2001; Langley et al., 2002).
Results of our study imply, however, that the effects of SIRT1
on lifespan might lie downstream of the cell cycle and be coupled
to the cellular machinery of mitosis itself. The key distinction
lies in the fact that nutrient withdrawal can affect the level of
SIRT1 transcription (Nemoto et al., 2004), whereas mitosis appears
to affect the level of SIRT1 protein post-transcriptionally. We
found no evidence for fluctuations in the amount of SIRT1
mRNA under conditions that altered mitotic activity both in vitro
and in vivo in any of the cells or tissues we analyzed. What we

did find was that replicative cellular senescence in human and
mouse fibroblasts was accompanied by a decrease in the level
of SIRT1 protein. Other studies with fibroblasts (Michishita et al.,
2005), human lung and breast cancer cells (Ota et al., 2005),
and primary neuroblasts (Horio et al., 2003) have reported similar
links between low levels of SIRT1 and reduced cellular proliferation. In addition, cells from mice deficient in SIRT1 show reduced
proliferative capability, a finding that is consistent with the
reduced tissue volume seen in tissues such as the pituitary in
these mice (Lemieux et al., 2005). We found, furthermore, that
the level of SIRT1 varies directly with the level of PCNA, which
is expressed during DNA replication (Paunesku et al., 2001). In
cells that senesce prematurely (p44+/+ MEFs), coordinate
decreases in SIRT1 and PCNA occurred at earlier cell passages
than in normally senescing cells. Igf-1r-null cells grow more slowly
and undergo crisis in vitro later than their wild-type counterparts
(Sell et al., 1994). Loss of Igf-1r in mice confers resistance to
oxidative stress (Holzenberger et al., 2003), which is known to
play a major role in murine cell senescence in vitro (Parrinello
et al., 2003). In Igf-1r–/– MEFs, these decreases in SIRT1 and
PCNA were not observed while cells remained mitotically active
and lacked the morphological changes typical of senescent cells.

linear correlations between levels of SIRT1 and PCNA were observed in (C) and (D), but not in (A) and (B) (F-test). 25 month group for GHRKO tissues include

and re-entered the cell cycle, SIRT1 and PCNA levels went up
again concomitant with increased mitotic activity. Finally, SIRT1
immunofluorescence inversely correlated with SA-βGal activity,
a marker for senescence. Thus, in both human and mouse
fibroblasts, the level of SIRT1 is linked to the activity of the cell
cycle.
We confirmed these results by experimentally manipulating
cell cycle activity with serum and a cell cycle inhibitor, aphidicolin.
We found that SIRT1 level was higher in fibroblasts that were
stimulated with serum, and that PCNA level changed accordingly. We found that the level of SIRT1 was very sensitive to
serum stimulation, reaching maximal levels at low concentration
(Fig. 3A,B), and that the increase could be blocked by aphidicolin (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that SIRT1 increases when
cells are allowed to go through mitosis and suggest that cell
cycle activity might stabilize the protein after S-phase. In fact,
we detect two SIRT1 bands at about 110 kDa in murine tissues
and cells (see Figs 1C,D, 3C, 5A,B and 7) as well as in human
cells (see Fig. 3A), which could be indicative of two different
post-translationally modified forms of the protein. These two
bands are detected by both anti-N-terminal and anti-C-terminal

SIRT1 polyclonal antibodies and an anti-SIRT1 monoclonal antibody. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation
and ubiquitination are known to affect protein migration in gels.
The organization of DNA into chromatin and chromosomal
structures plays a central role in many aspects of cell biology in
eukaryotes. DNA, along with chromatin and other modifications,
must all be replicated during mitosis (Ehrenhofer-Murray, 2004).
Because SIRT1 deacetylates histones (Imai et al., 2000), the
demand for SIRT1 may go up in proliferating cells. Then, as cells
stop dividing, the demand for SIRT1 would decrease and the
level of the protein decline accordingly.
Replicative senescence of human and mouse cells in culture,
although similar in phenotype, is thought to occur primarily by
different mechanisms. In human cells senescence is linked to
telomere attrition, while in mouse cells, it is linked to sublethal
oxidative damage suffered under standard culture conditions
(Parrinello et al., 2003; Busuttil et al., 2004; Shay & Wright,
2005). Normal cells senesce following any one of a number of
stressors, such as DNA damage, damage to chromatin structure,
and oxidation (Serrano & Blasco, 2001; Lloyd, 2002). All of these
ultimately affect the ability of a cell to undergo mitosis. In this

study, we found that conditions that alter mitotic activity in
fibroblasts control the level of SIRT1. We also found that the
levels of SIRT1 and mitosis were linked in tissues from mice
undergoing normal and accelerated aging. SIRT1 decreased
with age only in tissues in which mitotic activity also slowed.
There were two exceptions to this. In the thymus, SIRT1 levels
declined with age in both GHRKO mice and normal littermates,
and there was no difference in the rate of SIRT1 decline between
two groups (Fig. 7D). We conclude that this aspect of aging may
not be delayed in GHRKO mice. GHRKO mice also have low serum
IGF-1, decreased length and diameter of seminiferous tubules,
decreased testosterone secretion upon luteinizing hormone
(LH) treatment, and decreased fertility (Chandrashekar et al.,
2004). These endocrinological changes can account for the loss
of linear correlation between SIRT1 and PCNA in GHRKO testis
(Fig. 7B). Finally, the testes of p44 transgenic mice undergo
degeneration accompanied by abnormal Leydig cell proliferation
(Fig. 7A) (Maier et al. manuscript submitted). This could account
for the loss of linear correlation between Sirt1 and PCNA.
In summary, as mitotic activity ceases in mouse and human
cells in the normal environment of the animal or in the culture
dish, there is a concomitant decline in the level of SIRT1. These
results strongly imply that the level of SIRT1 and replicative
senescence may be influenced by a common mechanism, such
as the machinery that drives mitosis.

Experimental procedures
Cell culture
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were separated from subcutaneous (s.c.) tissue of embryos at 13.5 postcoital days and grown
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS
and high glucose, unless otherwise noted. IMR90 human lung
fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC. Cells were cultured in
37 °C with 5% CO2, with DMEM with high glucose (Gibco#11885)
supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and
penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For the serum comparison
experiment, C57BL6 MEFs and IMR90 fibroblasts were plated
subconfluently in 6-well plates in DMEM with 10% FBS, then
starved in 0.5% FBS overnight, followed by incubation with
0%, 0.5%, 1%, 5%, or 10% FBS for 48 h. For the growth factor
treatment experiment, nontransgenic MEFs from the ICR strain
were starved with 0.5% FBS for 24 h, followed by 0.5% FBS,
10% FBS, or 10% FBS with aphidicolin (4 µg mL−1, EMD Biosciences,
San Diego, CA, USA) for 24 h.

a ratio of 1 : 8 from passage 5. ICR MEFs that underwent spontaneous immortalization were serially passaged at a ratio of
1 : 8. The number of cells in each plate was measured and used
to calculate estimated population doublings at each passage in
IMR90 cells.

Protein isolation
Tissue samples were first pulverized in liquid nitrogen. Cells in
culture were first washed with PBS. Cell lysis buffer (1/10 RIPA
buffer, supplemented with 50 mM Tris, 137 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF,
1 mM EDTA, 0.2% sarkosyl, 1 mM DTT and 10% glycerol) in the
presence of phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA),
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), Trichostatin A, and nicotinamide
unless otherwise mentioned, were applied to pulverized tissue
or cells in vitro, then incubated on ice for 30 min. DNA was sheared
using a 25G needle syringe. Samples were centrifuged at maximum
speed for 10 min in 4 °C to remove any insoluble material.

Western blot analysis
Western blots were performed using a BioRad Western blot kit
(BioRad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins from each
sample (20 – 30 µg) were loaded on 4 –20% gel or 10% gel,
and proteins separated by molecular weight. After transfer to
a Protran nitrocellulose membrane (PerkinElmer, Wellesley, MA,
USA), the membranes were blocked in 5% milk/0.05% Tween-20
in PBS for 1 h, then hybridized with primary antibody overnight
in 4 °C. After washing with PBS-T/milk for 5 min three times,
secondary antibodies were applied and incubated for 1 h. After
another three washes with PBS-T/milk for 10 min each, either Pico
or Femto chemilluminescence substrates (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA)
were used to develop Western blots and X-ray films exposed
accordingly. The following antibodies were used: peroxidaseconjugated AffiniPure Goat-anti-Mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA, #115-035-100, 1 : 10 000),
peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat antirabbit IgG (Jackson
ImmunoResearch #110-035-144, 1 : 10 000), antiactin monoclonal antibody (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA, #69100,
1 : 1 000 000), anti-PCNA polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA, #sc-7907, 1 : 1000),
anti-SIRT1 N-terminal polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotech,
Charlottesville, VA, USA, #07-131, 1 : 1000), anti-SIRT1 C-terminal
polyclonal antibody AS-16 (Sigma #S5313, 1 : 1000), and antiSIRT1 monoclonal antibody 2G1/F7 (Upstate Biotech #05-707,
1 : 1000). For SIRT1 Western blots, anti-SIRT1 N-terminal polyclonal
antibody was used unless otherwise mentioned.

Serial cell passage
IMR90 human lung fibroblasts were serially passaged at a ratio
of 1 : 8 in 10-cm plates. MEFs from wild-type ICR strain and
p44+/+ transgenic mice were serially passaged at a ratio of 1 : 4
in 10-cm plates. MEFs from wild-type C57BL6 strain were serially
passaged at a ratio of 1 : 4, whereas MEFs from Igf-1r–/– mice
were serially passaged at a ratio of 1 : 4 till passage 4, then at

Western blot densitometry
Films were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics Densitometer
(GE) and densitometry was performed using ImageQuant5.0
(GE). SIRT1, PCNA, and Actin signals of each sample were measured
and SIRT1 and PCNA levels of each sample were standardized
to the levels of actin.

Total RNA from tissues was harvested with 1 mL of TriReagent
(Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA) after tissues were
pulverized in liquid nitrogen. After isolation of RNA, total RNA
was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
for 1 h, and RNeasy (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) was used to
purify RNA. Purity and amount of RNA were determined
spectrophotometrically (Eppendorf). Total RNA from cells was
harvested in a similar fashion except 0.5 mL of TriReagent was
used. Reverse transcription reactions to generate cDNAs were
performed with SuperScript III (Invitrogen) using 1 µg of total RNA
as a template and random hexamer as primers. Reactions were
performed at 50 °C for 1 h for tissues and for 3 h for cells in vitro.

(5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl–D-galactopyranoside), 0.5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 0.5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 overnight at 37 °C. The following day, cells
were rinsed in PBS once, demasked with ice-cold 0.1 N HCl for
15 min followed by incubation in ddH2O for 5 min twice, in PBS
containing 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.1% Triton-X-100 for 5 min, in
ddH2O for 5 min twice and in PBS for 2 min. Sections were
blocked with PBS containing 10% normal goat serum, 3%
bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton-X-100 for 30 min, followed by incubation with anti-Sir2 antibody (Upstate #07-131,
1 : 200) overnight. Cells were incubated for 2 h with Alexa Fluor
568 goat antirabbit IgG (Molecular Probe #A11036, 1 : 300) as
a secondary antibody. After washing cells with PBS, cells were
mounted with Fluormount G (Southern Biotech #0100-01).

Quantitative real-time RT–PCR

Acknowledgments

Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction was performed
in two steps. First cDNA was prepared as described above, then
1 µL of cDNA was used to perform real-time PCR. DNA FastStart
SybrGreenI kit (Roche) and LightCycler (Roche) was used for
real-time PCR. The specificity of the reaction was assessed by
the melting curve analysis. Each cDNA sample was measured
three times. The following primers were used. Murine SIRT1
primers: forward (1918-33): GTAAGCGGCTTGAGGG; reverse
(2132-2147): TTCGGGCCTCTCCGTA. Human SIRT1 primers:
forward (428-453): GAGATAACCTTCTGTTCGGTGATGAA;
reverse (595-621): CGGCAATAAATCTTTAAGAATTGTTCG.
β-actin primers: forward (412-431): CCCTAAGGCCAACCGTGAAA; reverse (500-520): ACGACCAGAGGCATACAGGGA.
GAPDH primers: forward (529-548): TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAGC; reverse (595-615): GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG.

Statistical analysis

References

Following densitometry, signal intensities were normalized to
loading controls (actin) and F-tests were performed to check for
significant correlation between age of tissues and SIRT1 signals,
levels of SIRT1 and PCNA, and levels of SIRT1 mRNA and protein
using Microsoft Excel. For qRT–PCR of tissues, F-tests were
applied after SIRT1 transcript levels were adjusted to those of
β-actin. For qRT-PCR of cells in vitro, after SIRT1 transcript levels
were adjusted to GAPDH transcript levels, F-test was applied
for IMR90 data. For ICR and p44+/+ data and data from cell
cycle manipulation with aphidicolin, t-tests were performed
using Microsoft Excel.
