Systemic dysregulation of TDP-43 binding
microRNAs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
Axel Freischmidt, Kathrin Müller, Albert C Ludolph and Jochen H Weishaupt*

Abstract
Background: A pathological hallmark of most amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases are intracellular aggregates
of the protein TDP-43. The pathophysiological relevance of TDP-43 is underlined by familial ALS cases caused by
TDP-43 mutations. TDP-43 is involved in processing of both coding RNAs and microRNAs, which are key epigenetic
regulators of transcriptome plasticity and suspected to contribute to neurological diseases. We therefore asked
whether the TDP-43 binding microRNAs recently identified in cell lines are also dysregulated in ALS patients. We
compared their abundance in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum and immortalized lymphoblast cell lines (LCLs)
derived from ALS patients and healthy controls.
Results: We found that expression levels of 5 out of 9 TDP-43 binding microRNAs were altered in the CSF and
serum of sporadic ALS cases. The differentially regulated serum microRNAs together with a poor correlation
between CSF and serum levels indicate a systemic dysregulation of microRNA abundance independent from the
CSF compartment, in line with the ubiquitous expression of TDP-43. The most strongly regulated microRNAs could
be confirmed in LCLs from genetically defined ALS patients. While dysregulation of miR-143-5p/3p seems to be a
common feature of ALS pathology, downregulation of miR-132-5p/3p and miR-574-5p/3p was evident in sporadic,
TARDBP, FUS and C9ORF72, but not SOD1 mutant patients. This parallels the TDP-43 pathology found in most ALS
cases, but usually not in patients with SOD1 mutation.
Conclusions: We thus report a systemic and genotype-dependent dysregulation of TDP-43 binding microRNAs in
human biomaterial that might reflect an easily accessible biological measure of TDP-43 dysfunction. Furthermore
we suggest an independent regulation of TDP-43 binding microRNAs in the serum and CSF compartment as well
as a generally low transition of microRNAs across the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.

Background
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized primarily by the progressive
loss of spinal motor neurons and cortical pyramidal cells.
To date, hundreds of mutations in more than 20 genes
have been implicated in the pathology of ALS, whereby
mutations in genes coding for superoxide dismutase 1
(SOD1), TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and
fused in sarcoma (FUS) as well as a hexanucleotide expansion on chromosome 9 in open reading frame 72
(C9ORF72) account for the most cases with a familial
background [1-6]. Despite our growing knowledge about
genetics, a vast majority of ALS cases (~85-90%) is considered sporadic (SALS), showing no family history and

spontaneous mutations in known causative ALS genes in
only a low percentage of patients [7,8]. Moreover, while an
increasing number of genetic causes for ALS and other
motor neuron disorders have recently been identified, epigenetic factors remain largely undefined with exceptions.
Pathological protein aggregation and/or neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions of SOD1, TDP-43 or FUS are a hallmark of nearly all ALS cases [8,9]. While aggregates of
SOD1 and FUS are mostly limited to patients with mutations in the corresponding genes, aberrantly distributed
and aggregated TDP-43 is additionally evident in patients
with mutations in other genes including C9ORF72 as well
as SALS, further pronouncing the central role of TDP-43
in ALS [1,9,10]. TDP-43 is described as a ubiquitously
expressed, multifunctional RNA-binding protein implicated in mRNA transcription and alternative splicing.
Although shuffling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm,

TDP-43 is located predominantly in the nucleus. When
mutated or under conditions of stress, TDP-43 translocates to the cytoplasm where it is hyperphosphorylated
and forms insoluble, ubiquitin-positive aggregates [10,11].
The nuclear clearance of TDP-43 as well as the aggregate
formation is thought to be involved in ALS pathogenesis.
Recently, TDP-43 was identified as part of nuclear
Drosha and cytoplasmic Dicer complexes [12,13] and
thus also implicated in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis
[14]. Mature 20–24 nucleotide miRNAs are predominantly negative post-transcriptional regulators of gene
expression acting primarily by hybridizing with the 3’
untranslated region of its target mRNAs resulting in
translational repression or degradation [15]. Previous
studies already showed that miRNA dysregulation can
be observed in neurodegenerative disease models [16]
including ALS [17]. MiRNA biogenesis starts with long
primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) cleaved by nuclear
Drosha complex into shorter miRNA-precursors called
pre-miRNAs. The pre-miRNAs are then transported
into the cytoplasm where they are further processed by
the Dicer complex into mature miRNAs [15]. Before
regulating transcriptome plasticity the miRNAs become
part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) facilitating interactions between miRNAs and target mRNAs
[18]. It was shown that TDP-43 as part of Drosha and
Dicer complexes binds to and promotes the cleavage of
selected pri- and pre-miRNAs during their biogenesis.
Knock-down experiments in cell lines could confirm 10
mature miRNAs as being dysregulated upon TDP-43 depletion [14,19].
In this study we address the question whether TDP-43
binding miRNAs are actually dysregulated in ALS patients
and determined circulating miRNAs in samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum from patients with SALS.
We compared miRNA levels between the CSF and the
serum compartment and evaluated altered miRNAs as a
potential indicator of decreased TDP-43 function in these
easy accessible body fluids. Furthermore we could confirm
dysregulated TDP-43 binding miRNAs in lymphoblast cell
lines (LCLs) derived from SALS patients and genetically
defined patients carrying mutations in the genes coding
for TDP-43, FUS, SOD1 and C9ORF72, identifying gene
specific miRNA alterations.

Methods
Patient cohorts and ethics statements

Appropriate approval and procedures were used concerning
human subjects. With informed written consent and approved by the national medical ethical review boards in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (WMA, 1964),
blood samples as well as CSF samples were drawn. CSF
and serum samples from the same individuals were

derived from 24 healthy controls and 22 ALS patients fulfilling the El-Escorial criteria for definite ALS. Patients
were considered sporadic cases (SALS) due to a negative
family history and no mutations in known ALS genes
(Table 1). There was no correlation between miRNA levels
and age (R2 ≤ 0,129) or gender.
Lymphoblastoid cell lines

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphoblastoid
cell lines (LCLs) were generated from healthy controls
as well as sporadic and genetically defined ALS patients.
For this study we used LCLs from six healthy controls
and eight SALS patients, again with a negative family
history and no mutations in known ALS genes. Genetically
defined ALS patients carried mutations in the genes coding
for TDP-43, FUS, SOD1 or an expanded hexanucleotid
repeat in C9ORF72. In detail we used LCLs of three
TDP-43 mutant (N352S), seven FUS mutant (four K510R,
two G478L, one R514G) and five SOD1 mutant (three
R115G, two E100K) patients as well as LCLs of seven
patients carrying the hexanucleotid repeat expansion in
C9ORF72 with repeat lengths between 620 and 1100 bp
(620, 800, 830, 950, 980, 1050 and 1100 bp) as determined by Southern blot analysis.
RNA isolation

RNA isolation was carried out with the miRNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen) as specified by the manufacturer. RNA from CSF
and serum was isolated in each case from 200 μl using
Qiagen’s supplementary protocol for serum and plasma including the spike-in of 5 μl (5 nM) of a synthetic miR-39-3p
of Caenorhabditis elegans (Cel-miR-39-3p) as a standard
for adjusting different RNA isolation and reverse transcription efficiencies.
Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR

For reverse transcription we used the NCode VILO miRNA
cDNA Synthesis Kit (life technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For CSF and serum samples
same volumes of equally isolated RNA were applied to the
reactions.
Quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) were run on a CFX96
Real-Time System (Bio-Rad) using the EXPRESS SYBR
GreenER qPCR Supermix (life technologies), the Universal
qPCR reverse primer included in the reverse transcription
kit and miRNA-specific forward primers. MiRNA levels in
CSF and serum were normalized relative to Cel-miR-39-

TDP-43 binding miRNAs are dysregulated in SALS patients

Recently, 10 miRNAs have been identified that bind to
TDP-43 in vitro during their biogenesis or in their mature form [14,19]. We measured their relative levels in
CSF and serum samples of 22 SALS patients and 24
healthy controls by qPCR. Of the 10 previously identified
TDP-43 binding miRNAs miR-181a1-3p was omitted in
this study as the effect of a TDP-43 knock-down was only
marginal compared to other miRNAs [14]. We additionally studied miR-9-5p, which has multiple functions in
neuro-development but does not bind TDP-43 [21]. In
CSF samples of SALS patients we found five out of the
nine TDP-43 binding miRNAs significantly dysregulated
(Figure 1A; Table 2). A significant downregulation was

Only miR-574-3p, miR-558-3p and miR-663a, as well as
our control miR-9-5p that does not bind TDP-43, showed
no significant changes in either CSF or serum samples of
SALS patients compared to healthy controls. The most
robustly regulated miRNAs in our study were miR-132-5p,
miR-132-3p and miR-143-3p which were reduced to ~70%
relative to healthy controls in both CSF and serum samples.
Further miRNAs found to be decreased in the serum were
miR-143-5p and let7b.
For our study, single CSF and serum samples were
derived from the same probands. We were thus able to
directly compare CSF and “peripheral” miRNA expression
at an individual-to-individual level. Interestingly, only the
relative levels of one miRNA (miR-143-3p) were positively
correlated between CSF and serum samples (R2 = 0.3524;
Figure 2), in contrast to all other miRNAs measured in
this study (R2 ≤ 0.166). Moreover, the majority of miRNAs
showed an up to approximately 50-fold higher concentration in the serum, while miR-9-5p, miR-132-5p and
miR-558-3p were 2–3 times more abundant in the CSF
(Figure 3; Table 3). The poor correlation of relative
miRNA levels between CSF and serum as well as diverse
concentrations and the differential ALS-dependent regulation suggest independent regulatory mechanisms in the
CSF and serum compartment.
Alterations of miRNA concentrations in CSF and serum
were generally not well correlated with ALS-FRS scores
of patients, which might be due to our SALS group

being almost exclusively at an early stage of the disease
(mean ALS-FRS = 39.2 ± 9.2 (mean ± S.D.)).
Mutation-specific analysis of TDP-43 binding miRNAs in LCLs

To further specify TDP-43 binding miRNAs in ALS
we took advantage of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs)
generated from healthy controls, SALS patients and
genetically defined ALS patients carrying mutations
in the genes coding for TDP-43, FUS, SOD1 or the
hexanucleotide expansion in C9ORF72. Although it is
known that immortalization of lymphocytes by EBV
transformation is accompanied by specific epigenetic
changes, e.g. the regulation of miR-155, the vast majority of miRNAs are most likely not contributing to
the transformation process [22,23]. This consideration
together with the ubiquitous expression of our genes
of interest (TARDBP, C9ORF72, SOD1 or FUS) provided a rationale to assume that alterations directly induced by mutations in these genes might be represented

in LCLs. In addition, the comparison of miRNA levels of
ALS-derived LCLs to LCLs from healthy controls further
reduced the risk that our observations were due to artifacts of the transformation process. We thus determined
the relative levels of TDP-43 binding miRNAs by qPCR,
and could reveal mutation-specific as well as mutationindependent changes that partially reflected what we
had found in serum and CSF samples (Figure 4; Table 4).
A distinctive and mutation-independent decrease to
~50-20% of the level of controls was measured in LCLs
of all ALS patients for miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p
(Figure 4A), similar to the finding in serum of ALS samples. Also in agreement with the results from ALS

controls and ALS patients. Genetic backgrounds of the LCLs are
indicated by the name of the proteins carrying the mutation, by
C9orf72 for LCLs with a hexanucleotide expansion in C9ORF72 or by
SALS for LCLs from sporadic ALS patients with no mutation in known
ALS genes. MiRNAs were measured by qPCR and normalized to U6
snRNA. Indicated is the expression of respective miRNAs relative to
mean values of the control group. (A) Both strands of miR-143 are
downregulated in LCLs of all ALS patients tested irrespective of the
genetic status. The lack of statistical significance of the decrease of
miR-143-3p in SOD1 and TARDBP mutant LCLs is rather due to the
small sample number available than to indistinct results. Though, both
show a strong trend (p ≤ 0.11). (B) Both strands of miR-574 and, even
more pronounced, of miR-132 are reduced in TARDBP, FUS and
C9ORF72 mutant LCLs as well as in LCLs derived from SALS patients. In
contrary, none of these four miRNAs is altered in SOD1 mutant LCLs
paralleling TDP-43 and FUS pathology. Also here, lack of statistical
significance for both strands of miR-574 in TARDBP mutant LCLs is due
to a small sample number available and results showed a strong trend
(p ≤ 0.09). (C) While miR-558-3p is unaffected throughout all ALS
groups, miR-663a and miR-9-5p are exclusively downregulated in FUS
mutant LCLs. Let-7b levels are significantly reduced in both FUS and
C9ORF72 mutant LCLs (bars indicate mean ± S.E.M.; n = 3–8).

patient serum and CSF, both strands of miR-132 showed
a similar decrease in LCLs of genetic ALS patients except for those carrying a mutation in the gene coding
for SOD1 (Figure 4B). The same pattern of regulation
was observed for miR-574-3p and -5p, which were
downregulated specifically in LCLs from non-SOD1 cases.
Hence, while a decrease of both strands of miR-143 seems
to be a common feature of ALS patient derived LCLs,
reduced levels of both strands of miR-132 and miR-574
accompany ALS cases with TDP-43 and/or FUS pathology. Dysregulations of further miRNAs measured in
this study were gene-specific and almost exclusively restricted to LCLs carrying FUS-mutations (Figure 4C).
Surprisingly, also the miR-9-5p that was originally
chosen as a control miRNA because it does not bind to

TDP-43 was drastically reduced in FUS mutant LCLs.
However, after completion of our experiment and in
agreement with this observation, miR-9-5p biogenesis
was shown to depend on FUS and miR-9-5p turned out
to bind also directly to FUS protein [24].

Discussion
MiRNAs present in bodyfluids are still controversially
discussed concerning origin, function and mode of transport. Nevertheless, circulating miRNAs have been shown
to be remarkably stable and to reflect disease conditions
designating them as useful biomarkers [25]. Several ALSrelated proteins, including TDP-43 that is most central
for ALS pathogenesis [8,11,26], have been shown to be
involved in miRNA biogenesis [14,19,24]. Specifically in
ALS, miRNA alterations are thus most plausible targets
for biomarker development or even therapeutic approaches.
Several miRNAs depend on TDP-43 for their biogenesis
and have been identified as TDP-43 binding in in vitro
knockdown experiments [14,19]. We now report downregulation of most of these miRNAs in CSF and serum as
well as in lymphoblastoid cell lines of sporadic and familial
ALS patients.
In conditions of cell stress, in TDP-43 transgenic mouse
models or in human ALS post-mortem tissue, wild-type
TDP-43 or mutants thereof tend to re-localize from a
predominant nuclear localization to the cytoplasm and
aggregate in stress granules and/or ubiquitin-positive
cytoplasmic inclusions [8,11,27-30]. It seems at least
plausible that the reductions in those miRNAs which
bind to and require TDP-43 for their biogenesis in vitro
[14,19] reflect an impaired TDP-43 function or altered
subcellular TDP-43 distribution in ALS patients. In line
with this consideration is the higher than expected number of regulated miRNAs amongst the TDP-43 binding
miRNAs, compared to an unbiased approach: 5 out of
9 miRNAs (56%) were shown to be altered (mostly
downregulated) in the CSF and serum, respectively. This is
a much higher proportion than found in previous studies
looking for regulated miRNAs in e.g. post-mortem brain
tissue of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions [31] or in leucocytes from
SALS patients [17] by miRNA arrays. The question whether
TDP-43 binding miRNAs are valid surrogate markers for
ALS disease progression or useful for diagnosis is beyond
the scope of this study and has to be clarified with higher
samples numbers and prospective sample collection.
To our knowledge this work is generally the first study
comparing CSF and serum miRNAs from samples matched
at the level of individual probands. We detected profound “systemic” changes in the serum, which were just
as pronounced as miRNA level alterations in the CSF
compartment. This surprisingly robust alteration of TDP43 binding miRNAs outside the brain and CSF

Page 6 of 9

compartment is in agreement with the ubiquitous expression and possibly disease-associated “global” functional alteration of TDP-43. Moreover, with the exception of miR143-3p whose relative abundance showed a clear correlation between the two body fluids both in patients and in
controls, the amount of most miRNAs was independently regulated between the two compartments at an
individual-to-individual basis. Furthermore, by comparing
the miRNA levels in CSF and serum of healthy controls
we could show that some miRNAs, like miR-9-5p, miR132-5p and miR-558-3p are more abundant in the CSF,
while others are higher concentrated in serum. Thus,
based on the limited number of miRNAs studied in our
work, CSF miRNAs do not seem to be a simple mirror
of the usually higher abundant serum miRNAs, nor do
changes in the serum necessarily reflect alterations of CSF
levels, which suggests that transition of miRNAs across
the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier is not significantly
contributing to their abundance in CSF or serum [32].
Nevertheless, systemically dysregulated miRNAs could
reflect relevant pathogenic aspects of ALS. Increasing
evidence suggests that ALS is a systemic disease, with a
“peripheral” pathophysiology, e.g. at the metabolic level
[33,34] or with regard to connective tissue [35]. Furthermore, altered serum miRNAs could partially reflect or
contribute to peripheral nerve and motor endplate pathology or the failure of regenerative attempts. The latter
possibility is suggested by the downregulation of both
strands of serum miR-132, which has repeatedly been
implicated in neuronal development and synaptogenesis
[36]. Moreover, this miRNA (and possibly others) might
not only reflect peripheral pathophysiological mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration but could also be a
basis for biomarker development in the future as specific
molecular markers could turn out to be useful surrogate
parameters for disease, even if a correlation between the
CSF and serum compartments is not observed.
Overall, our findings point towards a very specific regulation at the level of each miRNA. This is in line with the
known high target sequence-dependent, individual role of
single miRNAs that can also be tissue or even cell-type
dependent. Nevertheless, the fact that we observed mostly
a downregulation but rarely an upregulation of TDP-43
binding miRNAs could at least partially be the result of a
general default in RNA metabolism in ALS [37].
Transformation of patient-derived lymphocytes by EBV
transfection is routinely used to generate immortalized
lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) for preservation of DNA.
As expected, this transformation process is accompanied
and partially depends on epigenetic changes including certain miRNAs, e.g. miR-155 [22,23]. However, lymphocyte
transformation seems to depend on specific miRNAs
and the majority of miRNAs is most likely not contributing to the transformation process. We thus hypothesized

Freischmidt et al. Acta Neuropathologica Communications 2013, 1:42
http://www.actaneurocomms.org/content/1/1/42

that miRNA alteration resulting from specific mutations in
ubiquitously expressed genes (as TARDBP, FUS, C9ORF72
or SOD1) might still be represented in LCLs. We therefore made an attempt to identify gene specific changes
in miRNA levels in LCLs derived from sporadic ALS patients or patients with known gene mutations in C9ORF72,
SOD1, TARDBP or FUS, which were compared to LCLs
derived from healthy control individuals. We found both
strands of miR-143 downregulated in all ALS-derived
LCLs. As SOD1-mutant patients largely lack TDP-43
pathology [9] the underlying mechanism seems to be rather independent of TDP-43 malfunction. Conversely,
robust downregulation of both strands of miR-132 and
miR-574 are found only in LCLs derived from patients
with likely TDP-43 pathology, but not in LCLs carrying
a mutation in SOD1. We could thus show that the known
differences between SOD1 and non-SOD1 ALS regarding
TDP-43 pathology [9] are also reflected at the level of
TDP-43 binding miRNAs, at least in LCLs.
As TDP-43 and FUS share striking functional and structural similarities [6,8] it is not surprising that mutation
of either protein cause similar alterations of miRNA metabolism even in LCLs. Most interestingly, during this
study FUS has been implicated in the biogenesis of
several miRNAs that overlap with the TDP-43 binding
miRNAs found to be downregulated in our study including FUS mutant LCLs, e.g. miR-132 and miR-143.
Moreover, during our study miR-9-5p biogenesis was
shown to depend on FUS [24], providing a plausible explanation why this miRNA, which we had originally chosen
as a control miRNA because it does not bind to TDP-43,
was drastically reduced in FUS mutant LCLs.
Both strands of miR-132, which was the miRNA most
robustly downregulated in our study in serum, CSF and
LCLs, have been shown to exert multiple functions in
neuronal development and morphogenesis. Additionally,
downregulation of miR-132 has been detected in brains
of patients suffering from Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s
disease as well as from schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (summarized in [36]). Importantly, reduced levels
of miR-132 have also been found in brains of patients
with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions, a condition closely related to ALS with regard to
the molecular pathogenesis and TDP-43 pathology [31].
Thus downregulation of miR-132 seems to be a common
feature of several degenerative nervous system conditions. Moreover, even though very speculative, miR-132
downregulation may underline neurodegenerative facets of
the psychiatric diseases schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
Another miRNA found to be dysregulated in all types
of samples studied here were both strands of miR-143.
This miRNA has not been directly implicated in neurodegeneration so far. However, validated targets of miR143 comprise proteins involved in cell proliferation and

apoptosis [38] as well as multiple proteins participating
in actin cytoskeleton remodeling [39]. Recently, experimental and genetic evidence has implicated disturbed
actin dynamics in the pathogenesis of motoneuron diseases. For example, mutations in profilin 1, a protein required for actin polymerization, have been shown to
cause ALS in a subset of familial cases [40,41].

Conclusion
In summary, we found that most TDP-43 binding
miRNAs were altered both in the CSF and in “peripheral”
biomaterial, suggesting a systemic epigenetic dysregulation
in ALS. Regulation of a subset of miRNAs paralleled
known TDP-43 pathology in respective genetically defined cases. Our findings may be linked to the systemic
pathophysiology increasingly reported in ALS and plausibly
reflect an altered function of the ubiquitously expressed
TDP-43. Consequently, TDP-43 binding serum miRNA
levels are candidates for an easily accessible biological
measure of TDP-43 dysfunction in ALS. Finally, we provide the first comparison of miRNA expression levels in
serum and CSF based on samples matched from the
same individuals, which suggests an independent regulation of specific miRNAs in the two compartments and
a generally low transition of miRNAs across the bloodcerebrospinal fluid barrier.
