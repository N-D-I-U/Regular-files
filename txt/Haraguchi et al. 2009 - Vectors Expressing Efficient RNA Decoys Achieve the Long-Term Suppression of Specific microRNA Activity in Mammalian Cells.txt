ABSTRACT
Whereas the strong and stable suppression of
specific microRNA activity would be essential for
the functional analysis of these molecules, and
also for the development of therapeutic applications, effective inhibitory methods to achieve this
have not yet been fully established. In our current
study, we tested various RNA decoys which were
designed to efficiently expose indigestible complementary RNAs to a specific miRNA molecule. These
inhibitory RNAs were at the same time designed to
be expressed in lentiviral vectors and to be transported into the cytoplasm after transcription by RNA
polymerase III. We report the optimal conditions
that we have established for the design of such
RNA decoys (we term these molecules TuD RNAs;
tough decoy RNAs). We finally demonstrate that TuD
RNAs induce specific and strong biological effects
and also show that TuD RNAs achieve the efficient
and long-term-suppression of specific miRNAs for
over 1 month in mammalian cells.
INTRODUCTION
miRNAs are small (20–24 nt) regulatory noncoding
RNAs, which are initially transcribed as pri-miRNAs by
RNA polymerase II (1). Pri-miRNAs are cleaved by
Drosha in the nucleus to generate pre-miRNAs, which
are in turn processed to mature miRNAs after the
export to the cytoplasm. The miRNAs then modulate
the expression of multiple target genes at the posttranscriptional level as a component of the RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC). In the case of complete complementarity between an miRNA and its target mRNA
sequence, the miRNA will induce cleavage of this transcript, thus causing a rapid reduction in its levels.
However, most mammalian miRNAs have limited levels
of complementarity with their target sequences, located in

the 30 untranslated region (30 -UTR) of the mRNAs, and
cause either translational inhibition or rapid deadenylation of these transcripts in cytoplasmic processing bodies
(P-bodies). In this regard, it has been reported that
miRNAs form many regulatory networks with coding
genes (2). A growing body of evidence also now indicates
that miRNAs, which are expressed from speciﬁc promoters (3), play important roles in diﬀerentiation, development, oncogenesis and in the cellular defence response
to infection (4–6).
To perform comprehensive functional analysis of a speciﬁc miRNA molecule, a methodology that speciﬁcally
inhibits its activity is essential. There are some available
techniques designed to inhibit miRNA function, including
the introduction of short, single-stranded oligonucleotides
that are chemically modiﬁed such as 20 -O-methyl (20 -OMe)
RNA (7,8), locked nucleic acid (LNA) molecules and
‘antagomirs’ (9,10). These reagents are chemically synthesized to have complementarity to mature miRNAs, are
resistant to cellular nucleases, and probably also function
as noncleavable substrates of RISC. However, since they
are designed to be introduced into cells by transfection,
their inhibitory eﬀects are invariably transient.
DNA vectors that express a ‘microRNA sponge’, a
competitive inhibitor of microRNA, have been recently
described (11). The transient expression of these
microRNA sponge vectors inhibits miRNA function eﬃciently but for no longer than 1 month. This may be partly
due to the relatively low levels of the inhibitory RNAs
in the stable transfectant which are expressed via RNA
polymerase II. The establishment of a method that
would inhibit miRNA for a more prolonged period was
thus very desirable and was needed to enable a more
detailed analysis of the networks formed between
miRNA and coding genes. To enable the long-term suppression of miRNA, we chose a decoy RNA system using
lentiviral vectors that harbour RNA expression cassettes
driven by RNA polymerase III. We thereby designed a
series of decoy RNA molecules that were predicted to be
eﬃciently exportable to the cytoplasm, where the target

entire secondary structures of these decoys and the
sequence of miRNA-binding site (MBS) and have thus
established a novel and highly potent miRNA inhibitory
system which persists for well over 1 month.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmid construction
Oligonucleotide pairs, listed in Supplementary Table S1,
were annealed and cloned into the pMXs-GIN vector (12)
digested with NotI and SalI to generate pMXs-GINmiR140-5pT and pMXs-GIN-miR140-3pT (Supplementary Figure S2A and B), GFP reporter vector to detect
the activity of miR-140-5p and miR-140-3p, respectively.
The 0.7-kb BamHI–EcoRI fragment of pMXs-GFP (13)
was inserted into the BamHI–EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1
(Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3.1-GFP. The BamHI
and EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1-GFP were blunt ended
using Klenow fragment. The 1.7-kb BglII–EcoRV fragment of this plasmid was then inserted into the same
sites of pQCXIH (Clontech) to generate pSSCG. The
1.3-kb HindIII–XbaI fragment of pIRES1Hyg (Clontech)
was inserted into the equivalent sites of pcDNA3.1 to
generate pCMV-Hyg. The 2.1-kb NruI–ApaI fragment
of pCMV-Hyg was inserted into the NruI–EcoRV site of
pSSCG to generate pSSCH. For the construction of
miR-140-5p/140-3p retrovirus expression constructs, we
ampliﬁed 0.5-kb mouse miR-140-5p/140-3p fragment
by PCR from mouse genomic DNA using the primers
listed in Supplementary Table S1, followed by cloning
into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The 0.5-kb BamHI–XhoI fragment of this plasmid was cloned into the pSSCH vector
digested with BamHI and SalI to generate pSSCHmiR140-5p/140-3p.
For parental lentivirus vector construct (pLSP), we ﬁrst
ampliﬁed 0.3-kb iU3/HIV-1 30 LTR fragment by PCR
from pLenti6/V5-GW/lacZ (Invitrogen) using the primers
listed in Supplementary Table S2 and cloned the PCR
product into pCR2.1 to generate pCR2.1-iU3/HIV-1
30 LTR. We ampliﬁed 4.1-kb fragment by PCR from
pCR2.1-iU3/HIV-1 30 LTR using the primers listed in
Supplementary Table S2 and digested it with NheI and
SalI. An oligo pair, listed in Supplementary Table S2,
was annealed and cloned into this digested PCR fragment.
The 0.3-kb XbaI–PmeI fragment of this plasmid was
cloned between the XbaI–StuI sites of pLenti6/V5-GW/
lacZ to generate pLenti6/V5-GW/lacZ-NBES. The
1.0-kb ClaI–XbaI fragment of pSSSP (14) was cloned
between the ClaI and XbaI sites of pLenti6/V5-GW/lacZNBES to generate pLSP (Supplementary Figure S1D).
An oligo pair, listed in Supplementary Table S3, was
annealed and cloned into pmU6 (15) digested with BbsI
and EcoRI to generate pmU6-TuD-shuttle. For the construction of TuD RNA expression vectors in a lentiviral
background, a series of oligonucleotide pairs were synthesized as listed in Supplementary Table S4. Each of these
pairs was annealed and cloned into the pmU6-TuDshuttle digested with BsmBI. Each mU6-TuD RNA cassette, the 0.4-kb BamHI–EcoRI fragment, was then

subcloned into the lentivirus vector pLSP digested with
BamHI and EcoRI. These cassettes were also inserted
into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pSL1180 (Pharmacia) to
generate TuD RNA expression plasmids. An oligo pair,
listed in Supplementary Table S3, was annealed and
cloned into the pmU6 digested with BbsI and EcoRI
to generate pmU6-protoshuttle. For the construction of
Decoy RNA expression plasmids, a series of oligonucleotide pairs were synthesized as listed in Supplementary
Table S5. Each oligo pair (Decoy RNA #001–009,
014–017) was annealed and cloned into the pmU6 lentiviral vector digested with BbsI and EcoRI. Oligo pairs for
Decoy RNA #010–013 were annealed and cloned into the
pmU6-protoshuttle digested with BsmBI. The oligo pair
for Decoy RNA #018-022 was annealed and cloned into
the pmU6-TuD-shuttle digested with BsmBI. For the
construction of mU6-Decoy RNA #023 cassette, the
oligo pair listed in Supplementary Table S5 was PCR
ampliﬁed and cloned into pCR2.1. The 0.2-kb BsmBI
fragment of this plasmid was then subcloned into the
pmU6-TuD-shuttle digested with BsmBI. Each mU6Decoy RNA cassette, the 0.4-kb BamHI–EcoRI fragment,
was then further subcloned into a lentivirus vector pLSP
digested with BamHI and EcoRI.
For the construction of luciferase reporter plasmids, the
0.8-kb KpnI–HindIII fragment of pGL4.74 (Promega)
was cloned into pGL4.12 (Promega) digested with KpnI
and HindIII to generate pTK4.12-CP+. An oligonucleotide pair, listed in Supplementary Table S6, was annealed
and cloned into pTK4.12-CP+ digested with EcoRI and
XbaI to generate pTK4.12. Oligonucleotide pairs, listed in
Supplementary Table S6, were annealed and cloned into
the pGL4.74 digested with XbaI and FseI to generate
pGL4.74-T21 and pGL4.74-T16, respectively.
For the construction of the sponge-miR-21 expression
vector, the oligo pair listed in Supplementary Table S7 was
annealed, self-ampliﬁed by PCR and cloned into pCR2.1.
The 0.2-kb XhoI–AgeI fragment of this plasmid was
subcloned between the XhoI and AgeI sites of pLenti6/
V5-GW/lacZ to generate pLenti6/CMV-sponge-miR-21/
lacZ. The 0.3-kb XbaI–ApaI fragment of pCS2-Venus
(16) was cloned between the XbaI and ApaI sites of
pSL1180 to generate pSL1180-polyA. The 3.9-kb
HindIII–AgeI fragment of pLenti6/CMV-sponge-miR-21/
lacZ was cloned between the HindIII and AgeI sites of
pSL1180-polyA to generate pSL1180-CMVsponge-21.
Cell culture and construction of stable cell lines
Cell lines, HeLaS3, PA-1, HCT-116, SW480, HT29,
TIG-3/E/TERT and 3Y1 cells were cultured at 378C in
DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
HeLaS3 cells were seeded at 1  105 cells per well in sixwell plates and transduced after 24 h with pMXs-GIN,
pMXs-GIN-miR140-5pT and pMXs-GINmiR-140-3pT
viral stocks (<1  104 TU) in the presence of 8 mg/ml of
Polybrene and selected with G418 (1 mg/ml) at 24 h after
transduction. After 2 weeks of selection, the G418 was
removed from the medium. HeLaS3 cells harbouring
the miR-140-5p or miR-140-3p reporters were seeded at
1  105 cells per well in six-well plates and transduced

PAGE 3 OF 13

after 24 h, with the pSSCH-miR140-5p/140-3p virus stock
(<1  104 TU) in the presence of 8 mg/ml of Polybrene and
selected with hygromycin (0.5 mg/ml) from 24 h after the
transduction. After 2 weeks of selection, the hygromycin
was removed from the medium.
Virus transduction and FACS analysis
HeLaS3 cells harbouring both the miR-140-5p reporter
and miR140-5p/140-3p vector and HeLaS3 cells harbouring both miR-140-3p reporter and miR140-5p/140-3p
vector were seeded at 1  105 cells per well in six-well
plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, the
cells were transduced with each TuD RNA virus stock
(2  105 TU) or Decoy RNA virus stock (2  105 TU) in
the presence of 8 mg/ml of Polybrene. The medium was
then changed to DMEM containing 10% FBS and puromycin (1 mg/ml) after a further 24 h. After 7 days of selection, the puromycin was removed from the medium.
The GFP expression levels were measured using FACS
Calibur (BD).
Purification of nuclear and cytoplasmic small RNAs
Nuclear and cytoplasmic cellular fractions were isolated
from untransduced or TuD RNA tansduced HeLaS3 cells
harbouring both miR-140-5p reporter and miR140-5p/
140-3p vector 14 days after transduction. Fourteen
dishes (10 cm in diameter) for each cell culture were
rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buﬀered saline
(PBS), harvested in a further 2 ml ice-cold PBS by scraping, and centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 r.p.m. at 48C. Cell
pellets were suspended with NP-40 lysis buﬀer [10 mM
Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.5%
NP-40], incubated on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuged
for 5 min at 1500 r.p.m. at 48C. The cytoplasmic RNA
fraction was prepared from the supernatant by adding
ISOGEN (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka,
Japan). Nuclear pellets underwent two additional washes
with 4 ml of NP-40 lysis buﬀer. RNAs smaller than 200 bp
were ﬁnally puriﬁed with mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit
(Ambion, Austin, TX) from puriﬁed cytoplasmic and
nuclear fractions, respectively according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Five percent of the total yield of small
RNAs from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions was analysed by northern blotting to allow for a comparison with
the same cell numbers.
Northern blotting analysis
Small RNAs were separated on denaturing 18% polyacrylamide gels in 808C incubator, transferred to Hybond-XL
membranes (Amersham BioSciences) and crosslinked with
60 mJ/cm2 UV. The synthesized DNA probe sequences are
listed in Supplementary Table S8 and all probes were
50 end-labeled with [g-32 P] ATP using T4 polynucleotide
kinase (TAKARA). Hybridizations were performed using
Ultrahyb-Oligo buﬀer (Ambion) at 378C according to
manufacturer’s instructions and membranes were washed
using 2 SSC, 0.5% SDS buﬀer. Radioactive signals were
visualized using a FLA-5100 (FUJIFILM).

MiR qRT-PCR
Total RNA from TuD RNA transduced HeLaS3 cells
harbouring both miR-140-5p reporter and miR140-5p/
140-3p vector was prepared using the mirVana miRNA
Isolation Kit (Ambion) 10 days after transduction.
From HCT-116 cells that were transfected with TuD
RNA expression vectors, total RNAs were also prepared
using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit at 72 h after
transfection. Expression of mature miRNAs was determined by miR-qRT-PCR using miRNA-speciﬁc looped
RT-primers and TaqMan probes as recommended by
the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, CA). U6 snRNA
was used as an internal control. PCR was performed in
triplicate using the 7300 Real Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems).
Luciferase assays
PA-1, HCT-116, SW480, HT29, TIG-3/E/TERT and
3Y1 cells were seeded at densities of 1.5  105, 1.0  105,
3.5  105, 3.0  105, 7.0  104 and 1.2  105 cells per well,
respectively, in 24-well plates in DMEM containing 10%
FBS the day before transfection. The cells were transfected
them in triplicate with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
and 10 ng of pTK4.12 (Fireﬂy luciferase plasmid), 100 ng
of RLuc target reporter plasmid, and 500 ng of TuD RNA
expression plasmid or 500 ng of ‘miRNA sponge’ expression plasmid. We cotransfected locked nucleic acid
(LNA/DNA) antisense oligonucleotides at 50 nM. LNA/
DNA antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized by
ThermoElectron and contained locked nucleic acids at
eight consecutive centrally located bases (17). The LNA/
DNA antisense oligonucleotide sequences are listed
in Supplementary Table S9. We performed all assays at
48 h after transfection using the dual luciferase assay
(Promega, Madison, WI) on GLOMAX (Promega) for
PA-1, SW480, HT29, TIG-3/E/TERT and 3Y1 cells. We
assayed at 72 h after transfection for HCT-116 cells.
Western blotting
Total proteins were extracted from cells using 1.5 SDS
Buﬀer and protein concentrations were measured using
the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Protein extracts were
separated by 12% SDS–PAGE and transferred onto
PVDF-membrane (Millipore). Immunoblotting was
performed by incubating the membrane with the antibodies anti-PDCD4 (ab51495, Abcam) and anti-Actin
(612656, BD transduction) for 2 h at room temperature.
Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were incubated with the membranes for 1 h at room
temperature after three washes with PBS with Tween-20.
Signals were detected using ECL reagent (Amersham).
Assay for cell proliferation and apoptosis
PA-1 cells were seeded at 1  104 cells per well in 48-well
plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, the cells
were transduced with each TuD RNA expression virus
vector stock (1  105 TU) in the presence of 8 mg/ml
of Polybrene. Medium was changed 24 h after transduction. Metabolic activity of the cells was determined

e43 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 6

using a luminescent ATP-based assay, CellTiter GLO
(Promega), on GLOMAX (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. PA-1 cells were seeded at
3  103 cells per well in 48-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 18 h, the cells were transduced with
each TuD RNA virus stock (6  103, 1.5  104 and 3  104
TU) in the presence of 8 mg/ml of Polybrene. Medium
was changed 24 h after transduction. Forty-eight hours
after transduction, caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities
of the cells were determined using Caspase GLO 3/7
(Promega) on GLOMAX according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
RESULTS
Development of sensitive assay system for detecting
miR-140-3p activity
We developed a highly sensitive assay system for
miR-140-3p activity using HeLaS3 cells which expresses
marginal levels of endogenous miR-140-3p and
miR-140-5p (18). We constructed a retrovirus-based
GFP reporter harboring a 21-bp insert just downstream
of the GFP gene that was fully complementary to the
mature miR-140-3p (designated the miR-140-3p reporter)
(Supplementary Figure S1A). We then transduced this
reporter construct into HeLaS3 cells and established
mixed cell populations that stably expressed GFP. We
next constructed retrovirus vectors expressing RNA molecules containing the entire pre-miRNAs embedding both
miR140-5p and miR140-3p (denoted the miR140-5p/
140-3p vector; Supplementary Figure S1C). These vectors
were transduced into HeLaS3 cells harboring the miR140-3p reporter and mixed cell populations were obtained.
These cells showed <20% of the GFP expression levels
found in untransduced HeLaS3 cells harboring the miR140-3p reporter (Supplementary Figure S2A–C).

hairpin RNAs to Exp-5 has been shown to be drastically
reduced when the length of the stem sequence is <16bp,
we lengthened the stem of our prototype RNA decoys
from 17 to 24 bp (Decoy RNA #001–#006, Table 1,
Supplementary Figure S3). We utilized shRNA molecules
that targeted the coding region of the bacteriophage Cre
recombinase gene (shCre) as a negative control (NC) for
the decoy vectors. Because the prototype RNA decoys
with an 18-bp stem showed slightly higher inhibitory
eﬀects and also because dsRNAs over 20 bp are potential
targets for digestion by Dicer in the cytoplasm, we decided
to employ a stem length of 18 bp for all subsequent
studies.
Optimization of decoy RNA inhibitor potency by
altering the secondary structure and the MBS
of the prototype molecules
To increase the potency of our decoy RNAs, we altered
the design of these molecules so that their secondary structures were more complex than the prototypes (Figure 1B).
We again inserted the corresponding expression cassettes
into lentivirus vectors and introduced the resulting
constructs into the same HeLaS3 cell system. These
newly designed decoy RNAs (Decoy RNA #007–#013,
Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure S3) were found to be
more eﬃcient than the earlier prototype molecule, Decoy

Design and potency of prototype decoy RNAs
We designed decoy RNAs with simple secondary structures that would expose RNA sequences with perfect complementarity to mature miR-140-3p. These prototype
decoys (Figure 1A) form a stem–loop structure, the loop
of which comprises an MBS that is fully complementary to
mature miR-140-3p in addition to three linker bases in
both ends. To facilitate the stable expression of these
decoy RNAs in cells, we utilized lentivirus vectors carrying
short RNA expression cassettes driven by the RNA polymerase III promoter (mU6) which is present in both LTRs
after integration (Supplementary Figure S1D). Since RNA
transcripts generated by RNA polymerase III are terminated with UU or UUUU, the RNA decoys are expected
to have 2–4-nt 30 -protruding ends in the stem (Figure 1A).
We expected that our decoy RNAs synthesized in the
cellular nuclei would be exported to the cytoplasm, and
interact with the RISCs containing miR-140-3p. In this
regard, the nuclear transport of small RNAs with a
stem–loop structure has previously been examined in
detail and the length of the stem has been found to be
critical for the eﬃciency of this process via the function
of Exp-5 (19). Moreover, since the binding activity of

RNA #002 (Table 2). Importantly, when a 3-nt linker
sequence was inserted at both ends of the MBS of
Decoy RNA #009 (to produce Decoy RNA #013) the
GFP expression levels in the transduced cells were equivalent to HeLaS3 cells harbouring the miR-140-3p reporter
alone (Table 2). This indicates a complete suppression of
the miR-140-3p activity conferred by the exogenous miR140-5p/miR-140-3p vector.
We screened several alternative MBS sequences to further optimize the decoy activity. It has been reported that
MBS regions which contain four extra nucleotides
between positions 8 and 9 from the 30 end of a perfectly
complementary MBS, cause translational attenuation
rather than RNA cleavage (20). We thus speculated that
an MBS containing extra nucleotides may more strongly
inhibit miRNA function than a fully complementary MBS
(MBS-pf) as cleavage of the decoy RNA molecules themselves would be avoided. To screen for the most potent
MBS, we modiﬁed our prototype decoy molecule (see
Figure 1A) by inserting 1–4 nt between positions 10 and
11 from 30 end of the perfectly complementary MBS,
where the RISC cleaves the target mRNAs. When we
tested these new decoys (Decoy RNA #002, #014–#017,
Supplementary Figure S3), we found that the 4-nt
insertion (MBS-4ntin) produced the largest recovery of
GFP expression among the decoys tested (52%; Table 3).

As the insertion of linkers between the MBS and the
stem in Decoy RNA #009 greatly increased its inhibitory
eﬀects (Figure 1B and Table 2; compare Decoy RNA #009
and #013), we examined the eﬀects of linker length
changes of between 1 and 5 nt using Decoy RNA
#009 type RNA, the MBS of which is substituted with
MBS-4ntin (Decoy RNA #018–022, Figure 1C and
Supplementary Figure S3). Insertions of 1–3 nt resulted
in strong inhibitory eﬀects, whereas the 4-nt or 5-nt-insertion decoys showed only moderate suppressive activity
(Table 4). We thereafter adopted the 3-nt linker length
between the MBS and the stem RNA in our analyses.
We integrated our optimization results in an attempt
to increase the inhibitory eﬀects of the Decoy RNAs
#012 (see Figure 1B). We thus inserted 3-nt linkers
between the stem sequence and MBS and also substituted
MBS-pf with MBS-4ntin to generate Decoy RNAs #023
(Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S3), respectively.
Decoy RNA #023 showed a much improved potency
(an increased GFP expression recovery from 55.2% to
80.1%; Tables 2 and 5). We also tested Decoy RNA
#020, but there was no improvement in Decoy RNA
#020 when compared with Decoy RNA #013. It would
be because their inhibitory activities were almost saturated
to fully cancel out the exogenously introduced miR-140-3p
activity.
From these results, we tentatively concluded that the
structures of Decoy RNA #013 and #020 (Figure 2A)
have great potential in the design of eﬃcient inhibitors

of miRNA function. These decoys contain two MBS
regions, which are ﬂanked by two stem structures through
3-nt-linkers. We have tentatively designated this decoy
TuD (Tough Decoy) RNA and further analysed its characteristics and speciﬁcity as outlined below. The TuD
RNA expression cassette can be quite readily constructed
as shown in Figure 2B.
Generality, specificity and duration of the inhibitory
effects of TuD RNAs
To test the generality and speciﬁcity of the inhibitory eﬀects
of TuD RNA, we constructed a reporter cell system for
miR-140-5p in which the insertion sequence of the miR140-3p reporter was substituted with a sequence that was

fully complementary to miR-140-5p (Supplementary
Figure S1B). The inhibitory eﬀects of TuD-miR140-3p,
harbouring an MBS with four extra nucleotides
(TuD-miR140-3p-4ntin; Decoy RNA#020) and TuDmiR140-5p-4ntin (Supplementary Figure S4) were determined using both the miR-140-3p and miR-140-5p reporter
cell systems. In the miR-140-3p reporter system, TuDmiR140-3p-4ntin introduction resulted in a complete
recovery of GFP expression but TuD-miR140-5p-4ntin
expression showed only marginal eﬀects (Figure 3A and
Supplementary Figure S2D and E). In the miR-140-5p
reporter system, the converse result was obtained with
these two TuD RNA constructs (Figure 3B). These results
indicate that the inhibitory eﬀects of these TuD RNAs
are highly eﬃcient and speciﬁc to their target miRNAs,
lending further support to the wide applicability of these
molecules to miRNA suppression.
One important beneﬁt of using lentivirus-based vectors
is that the expression of the decoy RNAs is maintained
over long periods. We therefore transduced the TuDmiR140-3p-4ntin vector into HeLaS3 cells harbouring
both the miR-140-3p reporter and the miR140-5p/140-3p
vector and monitored the time course of the GFP
expression levels for more than 1 month (Figure 3C).
The results showed that TuD-miR140-3p-4ntin, but not
TuD-miR140-5p-4ntin, eﬃciently inhibited the target
miR-140-3p in HeLaS3 cells over the duration of this
experiment.

We directly determined the miR-140-5p levels using
quantitative real time RT-PCR. TuD-miR140-5p-4ntin
but not TuD-miR140-3p-4ntin, induced a 65% reduction in the apparent expression levels of miR-140-5p
(Figure 3D). This suggested that whereas the amount of
free miR-140-5p was reduced to about 1/3 of its control
levels, it was possible that dsRNA molecules formed
between TuD RNA and mature miRNA were too stable
for the mature single-stranded miRNA to be detected by
real time PCR (21).
Sub-cellular localization of TuD RNAs
We analysed the sub-cellular localization of TuD RNA
in HeLaS3 expressing TuD-miR140-3p-4ntin or TuDmiR140-5p-4ntin. Fourteen days after transduction, both
nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractions were prepared
from the cells and analysed by northern blotting analysis
after PAGE at high temperature to minimize intra- and
inter-molecule base-pairing. Speciﬁc probes for TuDmiR140-5p-4ntin and TuD-miR140-3p-4ntin RNA
(122 nt and 120 nt, respectively) detected sharp bands of
120 nt and the broad bands around 90 nt (Figure 3E).
Since the same RNA samples showed much stronger
signals in these lower broad bands when PAGE was performed at room temperature, the full-length TuD–RNA
molecules with intra-molecule base pairing formed these
bands. TuD-miR140-3p-4ntin and TuD-miR140-5p-4ntin
molecules were shown to mainly reside in cytoplasm,
whereas a small portion of TuD-miR140-5p-4ntin
molecule was also detected in cellular nuclei. These results
conﬁrm eﬃcient nuclear export of the synthesized TuD
RNA molecules and also suggest that the sequence of
the MBS portion in each TuD RNA molecule slightly
aﬀects nuclear export eﬃciencies.
The inhibitory effects of TuD RNA on endogenous miRNA
To examine whether the inhibitory functions of TuD
RNA had broader applicability, we next performed several experiments using a diﬀerent miRNA, endogenous
miR-21, as the target and employed diﬀerent assay systems whereby a comparison with traditional synthetic
miRNA inhibitors was possible. We designed two TuDmiR 21s, TuD-miR21-4ntin and TuD-miR21-pf, via the
same principles and procedures used to generate TuDmiR 140-3p-4ntin, and TuD-miR140-3p-pf, respectively
(Supplementary Figure S4). We next tested whether these
decoys would suppress endogenous miR-21 activity in
PA-1 cells and transiently cotransfected them using
DNA-based vectors together with Dual Luciferase
Reporters (DLR) i.e. the Renilla luciferase reporter with
or without the insertion of a 22-bp DNA sequence fully
complementary to the mature miR-21 into its 30 -UTR as
well as the Fireﬂy luciferase reporter as a transfection
control (Supplementary Figure S5A–C). As shown in
Figure 4A, PA-1 cell populations expressing TuDmiR21-4ntin showed a 25-fold higher expression of
miR-21 reporter Renilla luciferase activity, normalized
with Fireﬂy luciferase activity, compared with a vector
for negative control (TuD-NC) (Supplementary
Figure S4). TuD-miR21-pf showed lower inhibitory eﬀects

on 27 July 2018

but still induced a signiﬁcant recovery corresponding to
about a 14-fold activation. Importantly, the levels of recovered reporter activity were close to those of the control
reporter without the miR-21 target sequence. As expected,
this control reporter activity was found to be very constant
and independent of the decoy RNAs introduced.
Transfection of locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (LNA/DNA), LNA/DNA-miR21 showed a 2-fold
higher expression of the miR-21 target reporter compared
with LNA/DNA-scramble transfected PA-1 cells
(Figure 4A), showing that TuD RNAs have a much greater
inhibitory potency towards miRNA than conventional
synthetic reagents under these transfection conditions.
We performed similar experiments using HCT-116 cells,
which reportedly have higher levels of endogenous miR-21
than PA-1 cells (18,22). We obtained very similar results in
this cell system, except that the inhibitory eﬀects of
TuD-miR21-pf were dramatically lower than in PA-1
cells (Figure 4B). We have hypothesized that large
amounts of endogenous miR-21 would eﬃciently cleave
the TuD-miR21-pf molecule thus signiﬁcantly reducing
its concentration as compared with TuD-miR21-4ntin.
To test this hypothesis, we determined the expression
level of TuD-miR21-4ntin and TuD-miR21-pf in PA-1
and HCT-116 cells transfected in similar procedures to
those shown in Figure 4A and B, except that the reporter
plasmids were not included in the transfection. In PA-1
cells, both TuD-miR21-4ntin and TuD-miR21-pf were
detected as strong bands (Figure 5A). In HCT-116 cells,
TuD-miR21-4ntin was also highly expressed, whereas
the expression level of TuD-miR21-pf was very low
(Figure 5B), consistent with our hypothesis that TuDmiR21-4ntin is stable, whereas TuD-miR21-pf is susceptible to digestion, especially when cellular concentrations of
miR-21 are high. Considering these results, TuD-miRX4ntin should be used rather than TuD-miRX-pf, which
does not have the expected activity as Tough Decoy.
We next compared the inhibitory eﬀects of transiently
transfected TuD RNA expression vectors with those of
another miRNA inhibition vector, ‘miRNA sponge’
using this miR-21 luciferase reporter system in HCT-116
cells (Figure 4C). Transfection of LNA/DNA-miR21 and
‘miRNA sponge’ expression vector showed a 2.3-fold and
2.5-fold higher expression of the miR-21 target reporter
compared with LNA/DNA-scramble transfected HCT116 cells, respectively. On the other hand, TuDmiR21-4ntin and TuD-miR21-pf showed 63-fold and
5.5-fold higher expression. These results show that TuD
RNAs have a much greater inhibitory potential towards
miRNA than this conventional miRNA inhibition vector
under these transfection conditions.
Effect of TuD RNA on the expression
levels of the target miRNA
Using real time RT-PCR, the apparent expression levels of
miR-140-5p were shown to be reduced by TuDmiR140-5p induction (Figure 3D), and similar results
were obtained when RNA samples prepared from similar
cultures used in Figure 4B were analysed by real time
RT-PCR (Figure 4D). We next analysed the pre-miR-21

and mature miR-21 levels of untransfected or TuD RNAs
transfected HCT-116 cells by northern blot analysis after
PAGE at high temperature to minimize intra- and intermolecule base-pairing (Figure 4E). Importantly, this
northern blotting analysis indicated that the levels of not
only pre-miR-21 but also mature miR-21 were unaﬀected
in the presence of the corresponding TuD RNAs. These
apparently contradictory observations would indicate
that the absolute amount of mature miR-21 is unaﬀected
by TuD RNA introduction, and that eﬃcient and stable
formation of base-pairing between mature miR-21 and
TuD RNA molecules would have hampered the detection
of mature miR-21 by real-time RT-PCR as has been
reported in another RNA inhibitor of miRNA (21).
Efficient suppression of endogenous miR-21 activity by
stably transduced TuD-miR21 by lentivirus vector
As for biological activity of miR-21, several reports have
revealed that it often stimulates cellular proliferation and
plays anti-apoptotic roles in several human tumour cell
lines (23,24). To test biological eﬀects of the speciﬁc suppression of endogenous miR-21 activity, we have transduced lentivirus vectors expressing TuD-miR21-4ntin
and TuD-NC into PA-1 cells at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 10, where 10 copies of vector provirus in average
are integrated into each cell in the transduced culture. We
then analysed cellular proliferation by ATPase-based
assay (Figure 6A). Cells transduced with TuD-miR214ntin have shown only marginal growth (1.6-fold on
4 days after the transduction), whereas TuD-NC transduced cells have grown to more than 5-fold. When
an endogenous miR-21 target, PDCD4 protein (24,25)
was monitored in the parallel cultures, the expression of
PDCD4 was found to be increased by TuD-miR21-4ntin
compared with TuD-NC (Figure 6B). When the enzymatic
activities of caspase-3 + 7 per cell were determined in
similar cultures 2 days after the transduction, for apoptosis by those in TuD-miR21-4ntin transduced cells was
about 7- and 3-fold of those in untransduced cells and

endogenous miR-21 function induces growth suppression and apoptosis. Cell growth assay was performed after PA-1 cells were transduced

at an MOI of 10. Cell proliferation was monitored by ATPase based
assays and normalized to those of untransduced PA-1 cells on Day 0
and are represented by the mean  SEM (n = 3). (B) Eﬀects of transduced TuD RNA expression lentivirus vectors upon the expression of

western blotting. (C) Caspase-3 + 7 activation was assayed 48 h after

explain the reduction of overall growth rate. These
cytostatic phenotypes have become detectable even when
lentivirus was transduced at an MOI of 2.
The effects of TuD RNA on other family
members of the target miRNA
To examine the speciﬁcity of miRNA more rigidly, we
next tested whether the TuD RNA targeted to a miRNA
exhibits inhibitory eﬀects to other family members of the
miRNA, which share the same core sequence (2–8 bases
from the 50 -end of the miRNA). We have chosen the
miR-15a/-15b/-16/-195/-424/-497 family and tested in
HCT-116 cells, where expression of miR-16 is predominant (Supplementary Figure S6). So we expect the
reporter containing the sequence perfectly complementary
to miR-16 is mainly reﬂecting amounts of functional
miR-16. In this setting, we induced high-level
expression
of
TuD-miR195-4ntin
and
TuDmiR497-4ntin, respectively in HCT-116 cells, in which
endogenous miR-195 and miR-497 are expressed only
marginally (Supplementary Figure S6). The results of

plasmid vectors were transiently transfected into HCT-116 cells together with the Renilla luciferase miR-16 reporter (open bars) or the untargeted

assay, the expression levels were normalized to the ratio of the activity of miR-16-RL to that of FL in TuD-NC vector-transfected cells and are
represented by the mean  SEM (n = 3).

reporter assays (Figure 7) indicated the inhibitory activity
of TuD-miR195-4ntin is no less than that of TuDmiR16-4ntin, whereas TuD-miR497-4ntin has slightly
reduced the inhibitory eﬀect when compared with TuDmiR16-4ntin. Since the reporter expression is not expected
to result from the suppression of endogenous miR-195 or
miR-497, we concluded that TuD-RNA do not basically
discriminate miRNA members that belong to the same
miRNA family.
DISCUSSION
We expressed a series of designed RNA molecules with
potential RNA decoy activity and screened their ability
to suppress speciﬁc miRNAs using several highly sensitive
human assay cell systems as well as direct quantiﬁcation
of a protein targeted by an endogenous microRNA. We
conclude from our analyses that TuD RNAs are eﬃcient
and long-term suppressors of miRNAs.
A TuD RNA stem of 18 bp in length (Figure 1B, stem I)
promotes eﬃcient transport to the cytoplasm via the function of Exp-5 (Figure 3E). The two stems ﬂanking the
MBS (stems I and II) provide some resistance to cellular
RNase as well as to degradation by the RISC complex
containing the corresponding miRNA. The linker
sequences (3 nt) between the MBS and the ﬂanking
stems markedly increase the MBS accessibility to the
corresponding miRNA in a RISC. The combination of
these characteristics signiﬁcantly contributes to the
strong inhibitory eﬀects of TuD RNAs.
We designed RNA decoys with more complex structures than the TuD RNAs, and found that they also functioned as eﬃcient RNA decoys (Figure 1B and D, and

Tables 2, 5). Our data, however, show that TuD RNA
(Decoy RNA #020) inhibits miRNA more eﬃciently
than Decoy RNA #023 (Table 5).
An MBS region that was perfectly complementary to
the corresponding mature miRNA (MBS-pf) and an
MBS that had an additional 4-nt insert between nucleotides 10 and 11 (MBS-4ntin) were also compared. Whereas
MBS-4ntin was basically found to confer more inhibitory
eﬃciency than MBS-pf (Figure 4A and B), both had
similar miRNA inhibitory eﬀects under conditions of
near saturation (compare Decoy RNA #013 and #020 in
Table 5). In the HCT-116-miR-21 reporter system, where
endogenous miR-21 is abundant, TuD-miR21-4ntin
inhibited miR-21 much more eﬃciently than TuDmiR21-pf (Figure 4B), whereas in the PA-1-miR-21 reporter system, where endogenous miR21 is less abundant,
both of these TuD RNAs showed high levels of inhibition,
which were more eﬃcient than the LNA-miR21 inhibitor.
To explain these phenomena, we analysed the expression
levels of TuD RNAs and found that a high concentration
of miR-21 in HCT-116 cells would lead to the eﬃcient
cleavage of TuD-MBS-pf itself (Figure 5B), which, in
turn, signiﬁcantly reduces the inhibitory potential of this
RNA decoy. We therefore recommend that, as a TuD
RNA molecule, TuD-miRX-4ntin should be used rather
than TuD-miRX-pf, which do not have the expected full
activity as Tough Decoy. As for TuD-miR21-4ntin, its
potent inhibitory eﬀects were shown by Dual luciferase
reporter assay in a human teratocarcinoma cell line
(PA-1) (Figure 4A) and a human colon cancer cell line
(HCT-116) (Figure 4B). Whereas we usually transfect
500 ng of this TuD-miR21-4ntin expression plasmid into
a well (24-well plate), analysis of dosage-dependency

PAGE 12 OF 13

e43 Nucleic Acids Research, 2009, Vol. 37, No. 6

of this plasmid indicated that input plasmid DNA is saturated around 300 ng/well (24-well plates) and that the
DNA amount as little as 10 ng/well still show about 1/3
of the full luciferase recovery when tested in HCT-116 cells
(Supplementary Figure S7). Importantly, strong inhibitory eﬀects of this TuD RNA were also observed in
human colorectal tumor cell lines (SW480 and HT29),
an immortalized human diploid embryonic lung ﬁbroblast
cell line (TIG-3/E/TERT) (26) and also a rat ﬁbroblast cell
line (3Y1) as shown in Supplementary Figure S8.
Importantly, we found from our analyses that TuD
RNA achieves stable and long-term suppression of its
target miRNA (Figure 3C). We also showed that TuD
RNA can speciﬁcally and strongly inhibit endogenous
miRNA to induce speciﬁc biological eﬀects. This tool
could therefore be applied to the analysis of regulatory
networks which is formed either transiently or stably
between miRNA and coding genes. This is also applicable
to the construction of a knockdown mouse for speciﬁc
miRNAs. Since the mouse U6 promoter that is regulated
by Cre-loxP has already been well established (27,28),
time- and tissue-speciﬁc miRNA knockdown in mice
should be possible using modiﬁed TuD RNA expression
systems. As shown in Figure 2B, the TuD RNA expression
cassette is relatively easy to construct, it is also possible to
prepare a TuD RNA library against the entire human
miRNA repertoire to enable comprehensive analyses of
these molecules in future studies. Because of these properties, TuD RNAs will be very useful tools for future studies
of miRNA biology and potentially also for the design of
novel human gene therapies.
