Summary
Although it is well established that embryonic stem (ES) cells have the potential to differentiate into dopamine neurons, the molecular
basis of this process, particularly the role of microRNAs (miRNAs), remains largely unknown. Here we report that miR-132 plays a key
role in the differentiation of dopamine neurons by directly regulating the expression of Nurr1 (also known as nuclear receptor subfamily
4 group A member 2; Nr4a2). We constructed a mouse ES cell line CGR8, which stably expresses GFP under the tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) promoter, so the TH-positive neurons could be easily sorted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Then, we performed
a miRNA array analysis on the purified TH-positive neurons and found that 45 of 585 miRNAs had more than a fivefold change in
expression level during dopamine neuron differentiation. Among the 45 miRNAs, we were particularly interested in miR-132 because
this miRNA has been reported to be highly expressed in neurons and to have a potential role in neurodegenerative diseases. We found
that the direct downregulation of endogenous miR-132 induced by miR-132 antisense oligonucleotide (miR-132-ASO) promoted the
differentiation of TH-positive neurons, whereas ectopic expression of miR-132 in ES cells reduced the number of differentiated THpositive neurons but did not change the total number of differentiated neurons. Furthermore, we identified that miR-132-ASO could
substantially reverse the miR-132-mediated suppression of TH-positive neuron differentiation. Moreover, through a bioinformatics
assay we identified the Nurr1 gene as a potential molecular target of miR-132. Using a luciferase-reporter assay and western blot
analysis, we demonstrated that miR-132 could directly regulate the expression of Nurr1. Collectively, our data provide the first evidence
that miR-132 is an important molecule regulating ES cell differentiation into dopamine neurons by directly targeting Nurr1 gene
expression.

Introduction
Dopamine neurons are present in many regions in the central
nervous system with the largest population in the midbrain, and
they play important roles in motor function, emotional behavior,
natural motivation and reward (Bjorklund and Dunnett, 2007).
Midbrain dopamine neuron degeneration is a hallmark of
Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Weidong et al., 2009). Thus, an indepth examination of the molecular pathways underlying
dopamine neuron development is crucial for understanding the
pathogenesis of PD and for testing the potential of stem cell
therapy for this disease. Embryonic stem (ES) cells are
pluripotent cells that can be induced to differentiate into all
cell types of an organism and that have the potential to be used
in cell replacement therapy (Roy et al., 2006). ES cell
differentiation in vitro provides a powerful research tool for the
genetic profiling of dopamine neuron development and cell
biology. In recent years, several laboratories have investigated
the mechanism of differentiation of ES cells to dopamine neurons
and have identified a few regulatory factors that influence the
emergence of dopamine neurons during ES cell differentiation

(Prakash and Wurst, 2006). However, the molecular mechanisms
underlying the dopamine neuron differentiation process are still
largely unknown. Furthermore, emerging evidence shows that
noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), which form
part of the post-transcriptional machinery, have an important role
in modulating mRNA decay and translation rates in eukaryotes
(Lim et al., 2003). The combination of these diverse regulatory
processes on protein expression and activity allows for a wide
range of cellular responses to changes in the local environment.
miRNAs are a class of small, noncoding RNAs of 21–23
nucleotides that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by binding to the mRNA of protein coding
genes (Du and Zamore, 2007). Specifically, the ‘seed’ region
of a miRNA (centered on nucleotides 2–7) binds to the 39
untranslated region (UTR) or the open reading frame (ORF) of
target mRNAs by Watson–Crick complementary base pairing
(Yekta et al., 2004). Subsequently, these target mRNAs are most
commonly repressed by Argonaute-catalyzed cleavage and/or
destabilization. miRNAs play important roles in many cellular
processes, including stem cell differentiation and maintenance,

and neural lineage specification (Hatfield et al., 2005; Houbaviy
et al., 2003; Judson et al., 2009). However, there have been only
a few studies on the specific miRNAs expressed in ES-celldifferentiated dopamine neurons (Kim et al., 2007; Leucht et al.,
2008). This information is crucial because miRNAs could be
potential key regulators of dopamine neuron differentiation
(Hebert and De Strooper, 2007; Leucht et al., 2008). In fact,
miRNA-deficient mice, such as those with Dicer deletions, display
considerable impairment in dopamine neuron differentiation,
oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation (Hebert
and De Strooper, 2007; Kawase-Koga et al., 2009; Leucht et al.,
2008; Shin et al., 2009).
To identify miRNAs specifically expressed in dopamine
neurons and determine their roles in neuronal differentiation, we
stably transfected mouse ES cell line CGR8 with a tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH)-promoter-driven GFP reporter, and purified THpositive cells from the stably transfected ES cells using
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We then examined
the miRNA profiles of the FACS-purified TH-positive cells, the
TH-negative cells and neural progenitors using an ABI TaqMan
probe. The miRNAs with the largest changes in expression levels
in the differentiated TH-positive cells as compared with THnegative cells and neuronal progenitor cells were selected, and
among them we identified miR-132 as a previously unknown
regulator in dopamine neuron differentiation. Using bioinformatics
and molecular biological analysis, we demonstrated that miR-132
can directly regulate the expression of Nurr1, which is one of the
most important transcription factors in determining dopamine
neuron development and differentiation (Jankovic et al., 2005;
Saucedo-Cardenas et al., 1998). Furthermore, we documented the
interaction between Nurr1, brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) and miR-132 in the differentiating dopamine neurons.
Results
Derivation of dopamine neurons from mouse ES cells
stably transfected with TH-GFP reporter

To better obtain stably differentiated dopamine neurons from ES
cells, we modified the stromal cell-derived inducing activity
(SDIA) method by plating the ES-cell-derived embryoid bodies

(EBs) onto PA6 cells. Using our modified SDIA method we
found that almost all the clones showed TH-positive dopamine
neurons after 14 days of differentiation (Fig. 1A–D).
For the selection of ES cells stably integrating the TH–GFP
sequence, we used two steps to identify clones expressing both
TH and GFP. First, after transiently transfecting the plasmids into
CGR8 cells and culturing for 14 days with the antibiotic G418,
we selected 50 G418-resistant clones for analysis of GFP
integration by genomic DNA PCR. Of the 50 clones selected,
31 clones integrated GFP, and of these, we selected the 10 clones
with the highest GFP. We then expanded these 10 clones and
differentiated them into dopamine neurons by co-culturing them
with PA6 cells for 13 days. Using immunocytochemistry and
GFP fluorescence, we selected clone no. 48 which had the
highest level of TH–GFP co-expression (Fig. 2) for further study.

48. Following in vitro differentiation for 13 days, the clone cells
were sorted by FACS, and more than 90% of the resulting cells
were GFP-positive (Fig. 3A). FACS analysis showed that the
dopamine neuron differentiation from clone no. 48 contained a
significantly higher number of GFP-positive cells [4.1%60.4%
(n53)].
To confirm the gene expression of dopamine-related markers
in the GFP-positive dopamine neurons, GFP-negative cells and
neural progenitor cells, we extracted total RNAs from these cells
and analyzed the mRNA expression using real-time PCR. Fig. 3B
shows that the TH gene expression was dramatically upregulated
in the GFP-positive cells, confirming that TH is co-expressed
with GFP. In addition to TH expression, the other important
dopamine-related genes, including those for Nurr1, Pitx3, BDNF
and GDNF, were all significantly (P,0.01) upregulated in GFPpositive cells by approximately 14-, 4-, 14- and 4-fold,
respectively (Fig. 3C–F). Nurr1 protein expression also showed
the same increase as the mRNA (supplementary material Fig.
S5). We then detected the expression of nestin, a marker of neural
stem cells, which was found to be highly expressed in neural

evaluated G418-resistant clones by in vitro

staining of the five 9-kb TH–GFP clones (12, 24, 30

overlap (,70% overlap) in GFP fluorescence (green)
and TH staining (red). TH–GFP 48-1 showed

progenitor cells (supplementary material Fig. S3). We also
replated the sorted GFP-positive cells into cell culture flasks and
observed the GFP expression using fluorescent microscopy,
which showed that more than 90% of the cells were GFP positive
(Fig. 3A).
Using the TaqMan Low Density Assay v2.0 (Applied
Biosystems), we assayed the miRNA expression profiles of the
FACS sorted GFP-positive cells, GFP-negative cells and neural
progenitor cells. Of the 585 mouse miRNAs, 45 showed a more
than fivefold increase in expression in the GFP-positive cells
compared with GFP-negative cells and/or neural progenitor cells.
Among the 45 miRNAs, 17 miRNAs including miR-132 have
been reported to be expressed in the central nervous system
(Chen et al., 2010; Junn et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2007; Leucht

et al., 2008; Schratt et al., 2006; Sempere et al., 2004; Shioya
et al., 2010; Smrt et al., 2010; Zhao, C. et al., 2010) and they have
been known to function in neural proliferation, differentiation or
protection (Table 1). We then verified the change of miR-132
expression by real-time PCR amplification and found that the
miR-132 expression in TH-positive cells was approximately
tenfold and fivefold greater than in GFP-negative cells and neural
progenitor cells, respectively, which was consistent with the
miRNA expression profiles determined by the TaqMan Low
Density Assay (Fig. 4A). In addition, using the standard curve
based on the chemical synthesis of miR-132 (supplementary
material Fig. S1), we measured the absolute levels of the mature
miR-132 in GFP-positive cells, GFP-negative cells and neural
progenitor cells, which were 0.13 fmol, 0.034 fmol and 0.023

fmol per 2 mg total RNA, respectively. Therefore, the absolute
levels of miR-132 in GFP-positive cells was more than fivefold
higher than in neural progenitor cells. We therefore selected miR132 for further investigation.
Examination of the roles of miR-132 in dopamine neuron
differentiation

To identify the function of miR-132 in dopamine neuron
differentiation, we transiently transfected miR-132 mimics into
the TH-GFP-expressing ES cells on day 5 of differentiation. Three
days after transfection, we found that miR-132 mimics suppressed
dopamine neuron differentiation, compared with control mimics
(Fig. 4C; supplementary material Fig. S4B). The number of
dopamine neurons in the miR-132-transfected cells was also
significantly (P,0.05) lower than in control cells even after 14
days of differentiation. We then transfected synthesized miR-132-

ASO to further verify the effect of downregulation of endogenous
miR-132 on the differentiation of dopamine neurons. The specific
inhibition of miR-132-ASO on the expression of miR-132 is
shown in (supplementary material Fig. S2). As shown in
(Fig. 4B,C; supplementary material Fig. S4A), addition of miR132-ASO to the cultures significantly (P,0.05) promoted the
differentiation of dopamine neurons from ES cells.
Over-expressing miR-132 in ES cells reduces the
differentiation of dopamine neurons whereas miR-132ASO partially reverses this effect

To further determine the effect of miR-132 on the differentiation of
dopamine neurons, we cloned the miR-132 precursor into
pPyCAGIP and made stably transfected ES cells. By RT-PCR, we
identified three clones that highly expressed miR-132 (Fig. 5A). We
then induced differentiation of these three clones into dopamine
neurons by co-culturing them with PA6 cells and detected the GFP
fluorescence under a fluorescence microscope after 9 and 10 days of
differentiation. As shown in (Fig. 5B), miR-132 strongly inhibited
GFP expression compared with the stable clones expressing the
empty vector. Furthermore, after the miR-132-expressing clones had
differentiated for 13 days, the expression of TH and MAP2, detected
by immunocytochemistry, showed a dramatic decrease in THpositive cells in miR-132-expressing clones compared with control
clones; however, there was no difference in the total number of
MAP2-positive neurons (Fig. 5C; supplementary material Fig.
S4C). In addition, we transiently transfected miR-132-ASO into
miR-132-expressing cells after 6 days of differentiation. We found
that application of miR-132-ASO could significantly (P,0.05)
rescue the TH expression in miR-132 cells compared with negative
control (Fig. 5C; supplementary material Fig. S4C).
miR-132 directly downregulates Nurr1 protein expression

To determine how miR-132 affects differentiation of dopamine
neurons, we tried to identify the potential targets of miR-132
through a bioinformatics search. Notably, the bioinformatics
search identified Nurr1, the key transcription factor in dopamine
neuron development, as a potential target of miR-132, and we
Fig. 4. Transiently transfected miR-132 suppressed
the intensity of GFP fluorescence, indicating the
expression of the TH gene. (A) Relative expression of
miR-132 in cultured ES cells. The expression of miR132 in GFP-positive (GFP+) cells was significantly
higher than in GFP-negative (GFP–) cells, neural
progenitors (NP) and unsorted cells (Mix), which was
consistent with the result of ABI TaqMan-based
miRNA profiles (Table 1). (B) By transiently
transfecting miR-132-ASO and NC-ASO, miR-132
mimics (miR-132) and negative control (NC) on day 5
of in vitro differentiation, we found that miR-132ASO, the inhibitor of endogenous miR-132, promoted
the differentiation of dopamine neurons (determined by
immunocytochemistry of TH). (C) Overexpression of
miR-132 substantially suppressed the GFP+ cell
differentiation on days 8 and 14, as compared with the
NC overexpression control; whereas transient
transfection of miR-132-ASO could upregulate the
proportion of GFP+ cells. All real-time PCR
experiments were repeated three times in duplicate.
The experiments for differentiation were performed
twice (*P,0.01). Scale bars: 100 mm.

showed that four clones (miR-132A, miR-132B,

substantial decrease in the number of THpositive cells (green), whereas the MAP2positive neurons (red) were not affected. In
addition, we transiently transfected the miR132-ASO into miR-132 -expressing cells (miR132C) on day 6 of cell differentiation. miR-132ASO could partially rescue the suppression of
the differentiation of dopamine neurons by miR132. All experiments for differentiation and

found that the binding site of Nurr1 was conserved in several
species (Fig. 6A). To test whether miR-132 directly targets the
binding site of Nurr1, we inserted the sequence containing the
miR-132-binding site downstream of the luciferase reporter
vector and co-transfected with miR-132 into HEK-293T cells.
Our result demonstrated that miR-132 significantly (P,0.01)
decreased the luciferase activity of pGL-Nurr1-expressing cells
but had no effect on an empty pGL3 construct, which lacked a
miR-132-binding site (Fig. 6C). To avoid the interference of
endogenous expression of Nurr1 in HEK-293T cells, we repeated
the experiment using SK-N-SH, a neuroblastoma cell line in
which no Nurr1 expression has been documented. This effect of
miR-132 on Nurr1 in a luciferase assay could be replicated in
SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 6E). To confirm the predicted target
sequence of miR-132 binding to Nurr1, we mutagenized the
two sites of the ‘seed’ sequence by replacing C and T with G and
A, respectively (Fig. 6A, bold type). Notably, miR-132 failed to
inhibit the luciferase activity of the mutagenized Nurr1 construct
(Fig. 6D,F), indicating that the predicted sequence is indeed
the binding site for miR-132. Furthermore, to confirm the
downregulation of Nurr1 expression by miR-132, we used a fulllength Nurr1 cDNA vector. Transient transfection of miR-132
and Nurr1 into HEK-293T cells substantially inhibited the
expression of Nurr1 protein (Fig. 6B), which is consistent with
the result of the luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 6C–F).
The homeostatic interaction of Nurr1, BDNF and miR-132
controls TH expression and dopamine neuron
differentiation

Previous studies have demonstrated that Nurr1 directly regulates
BDNF and TH expression (Kim et al., 2003; Volpicelli et al.,

2007), and BDNF directly regulates miR-132 expression (Klein
et al., 2007; Schratt et al., 2006). To further explore the roles and
molecular pathways of Nurr1, BDNF and miR-132 in dopamine
neuron differentiation, we established dopamine neuron
differentiation in feeder-dependent ES cells (R1) using a fivestep method (Lee et al., 2000) that required 10–15 days for
differentiation of neural progenitor cells into dopamine neurons
(Fig. 7A). From day 2 to day 14 of differentiation the expression
patterns of Nurr1 and miR-132 were inversely related (Fig. 7D),
but the expression patterns of BDNF and miR-132 were similar
(Fig. 7E). The dopamine neurons differentiation of miR-132infected ES cells was significantly (P,0.05) less than in the ES
cells infected with pLVX empty vector (Fig. 7B; supplementary
material Fig. S4D), which agreed with the results in feeder-free
ES cells. Nurr1 expression was downregulated by miR-132 but
upregulated by miR-132-ASO (Fig. 7C). The lower panel of
(Fig. 7C) show that miR-132 downregulated Nurr1 expression by
35.5% and miR-132-ASO upregulated Nurr1 expression by 24%.
We also found that the addition of BDNF to the cultures from day
4 to day 8 of differentiation days elevated the expression of miR132 (Fig. 7F), which is consistent with the result of previous
studies (Klein et al., 2007; Schratt et al., 2006). However, longer
exposure to BDNF resulted in less change in miR-132 (Fig. 7F).
By contrast, Nurr1 expression was downregulated from day 4
to day 8 of differentiation and upregulated at day 10 of
differentiation (Fig. 7F). These results suggest a the
homeostatic interaction between Nurr1, BDNF and miR-132.
Discussion
The conditional knockout of Dicer has shown that miRNAs play
essential roles in dopamine neuron differentiation (Kim et al.,

2007). Several studies have identified a negative feedback
circuit of miR-133b and Pitx3, a crucial transcription factor in
dopamine neuron development (Hebert and De Strooper, 2007).
These studies have also suggested that other miRNAs, in
addition to miR-133b, have a function in dopamine neuron
differentiation, but little is known about them (Hebert and De
Strooper, 2007; Kawase-Koga et al., 2009). To document the
newly identified miRNAs in dopamine neuron differentiation,
we constructed a TH-promoter-derived reporter system to
establish purified dopamine neurons differentiated from ES
cells, and obtain their miRNA profile. To our knowledge this
study is the first to establish a miRNA profile from purified
dopamine neurons. The overlay of TH staining and GFP
fluorescence showed that approximately 70% of the GFPpositive cells are TH-expressing dopamine neurons, which is
consistent with previous studies (Hedlund et al., 2007;
Yoshizaki et al., 2004). The 9-kb fragment of the rat TH
promoter, including intron sequences and a poly(A) tail, could
efficiently drive GFP expression in dopamine neurons
differentiated from ES cells. The lack of complete overlap of
TH and GFP expression could be attributed to the size of the
promoter fragment or the different half-lives of TH and GFP
(Hedlund et al., 2007). However, the gene expression analysis of
different dopamine markers, in conjunction with previous
studies, indicates that the vast majority of sorted cells are of
the dopamine lineage (Yoshizaki et al., 2004; Hedlund et al.,
2007).
The relative miRNA expression profiles of GFP-positive, GFPnegative and neural progenitor cells during differentiation

process identified by TaqMan Low Density Assay and then
confirmed by real-time PCR in our study identified several
miRNAs, including miR-133b, miR-9 and miR-7, that have been
reported to play a role in the central neural system, dopamine
neuron development and differentiation, and have possible links
to PD (Junn et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2007; Leucht et al., 2008).
These results suggest that using purified dopamine neurons is of
great value in the search for new miRNAs involved in dopamine
neuron differentiation. We selected miR-132 for further study on
the basis of a bioinformatics prediction, showing Nurr1, a crucial
transcription factor for midbrain dopamine neuron development
and differentiation (Kim et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2006; Luo et al.,
2008), is a potential target of miR-132. miR-132 is necessary for
BDNF-stimulated dendritic outgrowth (Wayman et al., 2008).
Further characterization of miR-132 revealed that it can be
induced by BDNF and it is able to modulate dendritic
morphology through suppression of p250GTPase-activating
protein (p250GAP) (Edbauer et al., 2010; Magill et al., 2010;
Nudelman et al., 2010; Wayman et al., 2008). Additionally, it
has been shown that miR-132 can regulate the expression of
the methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP2), a key factor in
neurodevelopment and neurological disease (Klein et al., 2007).
These results further suggest an association of miR-132 with
neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD.
In our study, miR-132-ASO, which can inhibit the endogenous

Fig. 7. The homeostatic interaction of Nurr1, BDNF, miR-132 and TH. (A) Five-step method for dopamine neuron differentiation. Mouse ES cells (R1 cell
line) were maintained in the presence of LIF; initial differentiation was induced by the formation of EBs for 4 days followed by neural progenitor selection for
6–10 days by replating EBs and withdrawing serum; after amplification of neural progenitor for 4–6 days in the presence of bFGF, Shh and FGF8 (red: nestin),
dopamine neurons were grown for 10–15 days and stained with TH (red) and MAP2 (green). (B,C) Overexpression of miR-132 by lentivirus infection
dramatically inhibited the appearance of TH-positive cells [TH (red) and MAP2 (green)] by downregulating Nurr1 expression, whereas miR-132-ASO could

rescue the miR-132-induced suppression of dopamine neuron
differentiation, further supporting the specific suppression effects
of miR-132 on dopamine neuron differentiation.
The direct regulatory effect of miR-132 on the expression of
Nurr1 was further confirmed by genetic modification of the
binding site of miR-132. We found that the mutation totally
abolished the regulatory effect of miR-132 on Nurr1. It is well
documented that Nurr1 can regulate the expression of BDNF and
promote the development and maintenance of dopamine neurons
(Kim et al., 2003; Volpicelli et al., 2007), whereas BDNF can
induce miR-132 expression (Klein et al., 2007; Schratt et al.,
2006), suggesting a potential feedback loop for Nurr1 and miR132. We also found that in the process of dopamine neuron
differentiation, the expression of Nurr1, BDNF and miR-132
continuously changed; Nurr1 and miR-132 expression patterns
were inversely related, whereas that of BDNF and miR-132 were
similar. The addition of BDNF caused upregulation of miR-132
and downregulation of Nurr1. Moreover, suppressing Nurr1
expression by miR-132 inhibited the expression of BDNF and
further lead to the downregulation of miR-132. This lead to a new
equilibrium between Nurr1 and miR-132. Together with the
previous studies on the direct regulation of BDNF expression by

Nurr1 and miR-132 expression by BDNF, we propose a possible
homeostatic interaction between Nurr1, BDNF, miR-132 and TH,
although further investigation is required to validate this finding.
Nurr1 is an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor
superfamily of transcription factors. It is highly expressed in
the ventral mesencephalon, which includes the mesencephalic
dopamine neurons (Jankovic et al., 2005; Saucedo-Cardenas et al.,
1998). The onset of Nurr1 expression in mesencephalic dopamine
neurons is at E10.5 in the mouse, just prior to the expression of the
dopamine markers TH and Pitx3 (E11.5) (Smidt et al., 2000), and
expression continues into the adult stage (Weidong et al., 1999).
Nurr1 is known to be essential for induction of the mesencephalic
dopamine phenotype and for the survival and/or maintenance of
these neurons (Kim et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2006; Luo et al., 2008).
Recent studies showed that Nurr1 works in conjunction with Pitx3 to
enhance the differentiation of ES cells into dopamine neurons
(Jacobs et al., 2009; Martinat et al., 2006). In addition, Nurr1 is
found to play a previously unexpected role in protecting these
neurons from inflammation-induced neurotoxicity induced by
lipopolysaccharide stimulation (Saijo et al., 2009). Interestingly,
miR-132 could also be induced by lipopolysaccharide stimulation
(Shaked et al., 2009). The direct effect of miR-132 on the production

1680

Journal of Cell Science 125 (7)

of Nurr1 protein raises the possibility that miR-132 might be
involved in inflammatory process of dopamine neuron degeneration
in addition of its effect on dopamine neuron differentiation.
In conclusion, we report here the miRNA profiles of purified
dopamine neurons using the TH-promoter-derived GFP reporter
system, and we provide the first evidence that miR-132 is an
important molecule that negatively regulates dopamine neuron
differentiation in ES cells by directly suppressing Nurr1
expression. This finding will greatly enhance our understanding
of the molecular mechanisms involved in dopamine neuron
differentiation and shed new light on the generation of ES cells to
be used in cell replacement therapy for PD and other neurological
diseases involving dopamine neuron degeneration.
Materials and Methods

Cell culture, transfection and differentiation

All cell culture reagents and culture plastics were obtained from Gibco (Rockville,
MD) and BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA), respectively, unless otherwise
specified.
The mouse feeder-independent ES cell line (CGR8, early passages 19–30) was
obtained from Austin Smith (Centre for Genome Research, University of
Edinburgh, UK) (Ying et al., 2003) and Ying Jin (Institute of Health Sciences,
Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Science) and was
cultured in gelatin-coated Petri dishes without feeder cells in Glasgow minimal
essential medium (GMEM) supplemented with nonessential amino acids, Lglutamine, 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% ES cell-qualified fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; 1:10,000 dilution; Chemicon, Temecula, CA)
in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 ˚C. Cultures were maintained at 70%
confluency to maintain an undifferentiated phenotype. Cells were passaged every 2
days. Embryoid bodies (EBs) were formed in floating cultures at 2.56105/ml or in
hanging drop cultures at 1000 cells/20 ml for 4 days with GMEM medium without
LIF. For transient transfection of miRNA mimics, negative control (NC), miR132-ASO and NC-ASO, 150 nM of each chemical compound was transfected into
ES cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For stable transfection of a miR-132-expressing
plasmid, the vector was transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 for 24
hours and then selected using 1.5 mg/ml puromycin (Roche, Switzerland) for 2
weeks. The single clones were picked and cultured for confirmation and further
experiments.
R1 mouse ES cells were cultured on mitomycin-C-treated mouse embryonic
fibroblasts in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 15% FBS,
2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 100 IU/ml penicillin and
streptomycin, 55 mM b-mercaptoethanol and LIF. The five-step method for
dopamine neuron differentiation was performed as described previously (Lee et al.,
2000). The method for transient transfection in R1 cells was same as for CGR8
cells, which was performed on day 3 when neural prognitor cells began
amplification in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN). BDNF (50 ng/ml; R&D Systems) was added to the
medium on day 4 of dopamine neuron differentiation.
PA6 is a stromal cell line derived from newborn mouse calvariae. PA6 cells
were purchased from Riken (Tsukuba, Japan) and maintained in PA6 culture
medium [a-MEM supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml
streptomycin (PEST) and 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT)].
SK-N-SH is a neuroblastoma cell line, which was purchased from the Cell Bank
of the Chinese Academy of Science; cells were routinely cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and penicillin and streptomycin (PEST) at
37 ˚C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. When the cells reached
80–90% confluency, they were subdivided into 24-well plates with 16105 cells/
well for luciferase-reporter transfection and assay.
HEK-293T cells were obtained from the Cell Bank at the Chinese Academy of
Science. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and
PEST at 37 ˚C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. At ,60% confluency HEK-293T cells
were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with varying concentrations of
synthetic miRNA mimics, NC-mimics (all from Genepharma, Shanghai, China)
and plasmids, according to standard protocols. They were collected at different
time points after transfection for luciferase and western blot assays.
CGR8 cells were differentiated using the stromal cell-derived inducing activity
(SDIA) method, in which the cells were co-cultured with PA6 cells (Kawasaki
et al., 2000). The classic SDIA method of directly plating the ES cells on PA6
feeder cells did not produce consistent dopamine differentiation. We improved this
method by plating the ES-cell-derived EBs on PA6 cells, which established a more
stable differentiation and constant efficiency, as compared with the classic SDIA
method. To differentiate ES cells in vitro, PA6 cells were plated on gelatin-coated
culture dishes to make a uniform feeder monolayer 1 day before the addition of

CGR8-cell-derived EBs. ES differentiation medium [GMEM supplemented with
10% knockout serum replacement (KSR), 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids,
1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and PEST] was used in place
of ES cell medium, and cells differentiated for 10 days. The culture medium was
changed every other day. The efficiency of differentiation was examined using
immunocytochemistry.
Plasmid construction

A Nurr1 protein expression vector was created by PCR cloning of Nurr1 cDNA
using a two fragment ligation processes. Two PCR reactions were performed with
the following primer sets: fragment 1: 59-GGCAAGCTTTTTGTCCTTCGCTGAATTACGA-39, 59-AGAACTGCTGGATATGTTGGGT-39; fragment 2: 59GTTGGGATGGTTAAAGAAGTGG-39, 59-GGCTCTAGAAAAGGCAGTGACTCATCTCATG-39. Then the fragments were cloned into pcDNA3.1 at the HindIII
and BglII sites (Takara, Dalian, China). The expression vector of pre-miR-132 was
constructed by amplification of the mouse genomic cDNA, with the following
primer set: 59- GGCAGATCTCTCGGGCACGCCTGTTCA-39 and 59-GGCCTCGAGTGCCACCT CCGCAGACAC-39, and ligated into pPyCAGIP at the BglII
and XhoI sites (Takara).
The luciferase reporter vector containing the wild-type sequence and the miR132 binding site was amplified by the primer set 59-GCGGAATTCCGACATTTCTGCCTTCTCC-39, 59-GGACTGCAGAGTTTGTCAATTATTGCTGGTG-39, using mouse midbrain cDNA as template. The PCR fragment was cloned
into the EcoRI and PstI sites (Takara) in the pGL3 luciferase vector (Promega,
Madison, WI). The mutant sequence had two mutations in the ‘seed’ sequence of
the miR-132 binding site, which is indicated in (Fig. 6A). We designed the primers
59-CTACCTGTCTAAAGTGTAGGGGAAGCTGCCA-39 and 59-TGGCAGCTTCCCCTACACTTTAGACAGGTAG-39 and amplified the pGL3-miR-132 plasmid.
Following overnight digestion with DpnI (Fermentas), the PCR products were
transformed into Escherichia coli DH10B.
All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing using an ABI 3730xl DNA
Analyzers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Lentivirus preparation

A mouse genomic DNA fragment comprising miR-132 was amplified by PCR using
the following primers set: 59-GGCGAATTCCTCGGGCACGCCTGTTCA-39; and
59-GGCGGATCCTGCCACCTCCGCAGACAC-39. The amplified fragment was
inserted into EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites of lentiviral vector pLVXEF1a-IRES-ZsGreen1.
Sequencing-verified plasmid was then transfected into 90% confluent HEK293FT cells together with packaging plasmid psPAX2 (Addgene, Cambridge, MA)
and envelope plasmid pMD2.G (Addgene; addgene.org) using the calcium
phosphate transfection method. The supernatants containing virus were collected
after 48 hours, then filtered through a 0.45 mm filter. Filtered supernatants were
concentrated 100-fold with a PEG Virus Precipitation Kit (BioVison, Mountain
View, CA) and resuspended in PBS, using the method of Tiscornia et al. (Tiscornia
et al., 2006). For ES cells infection, 100 ml concentrated virus supplemented with
10 mg/ml polybrene was used to infect ES cells. After an overnight incubation,
supernatants were replaced with fresh culture medium.
TH promoter engineered GFP-reporter ES cells, FACS, RNA isolation and
real-time PCR

The pTH-GFP construct containing the GFP reporter expressed under the 9-kb 59flanking region of the rat TH gene was a kind gift of Kazuto Kobayashi (Jomphe
et al., 2005; Sawamoto et al., 2001; Yoshizaki et al., 2004) (Fukushima Medical
University School of Medicine, Japan). The CGR8 ES cells were co-transfected
with the pTH-GFP plasmid and pCDNA3.1-neo plasmid containing antibiotic
resistant gene to obtain the stable transfection line. Stably transfected cells were
selected on ES medium containing 750 mg/ml G418 (Roche). We screened a large
number of independent, drug-resistant colonies (50 of the smaller-sized colonies of
each construct) to isolate those exhibiting a consistent coexpression pattern of TH
and GFP following in vitro differentiation on PA6 cells. A few clones that were
only transfected with pcDNA3.1 were selected as NCs for GFP expression. After
differentiation for 13 days on PA6, the clone that had the most overlap of GFP and
TH was selected for expansion.
Cells were differentiated for 13–14 days, harvested using 0.05% Trypsin–
EDTA, gently dissociated into a single-cell suspension, and resuspended in a
Mg2+- and Ca2+-free phosphate buffered-saline (PBS) solution containing PEST
and 2% FBS. Final cell density was 16107/ml. Samples were filtered with a
40 mm cell filter (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and sorted immediately
by BD FACSAria.
After differentiation and FACS sorting, total RNAs from ES cell-derived neural
progenitors, GFP-positive neurons and GFP-negative neurons were extracted using
Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen), followed by treatment with DNaseI (Promega). cDNA
was obtained using 2 mg of RNA in the ReverTra Ace first-strand synthesis system for
RT-PCR (Toyobo, Japan). The resulting cDNA was used as a template for the PCR
reactions. To reduce non-specific signals, primers for each gene were designed using
the Primer Premier software (Oxford Molecular Ltd., Oxford, UK). We selected

Journal of Cell Science

primer sets that yielded specific products without the presence of non-specific bands,
as evaluated by gel electrophoresis. The following primer sets were chosen for
semiquantitative RT-PCR and real time PCR analyses. b-actin: 59-GGCATTGTGATGGACTCCGG-39; 59-TGCCACAGGATTCCATACCC-39. TH: 59-AGTACTTTGTGCGCTTCGAGGTG-39; 59-CTTGGGAACCAGGGAACCTTG9. Pitx3:
59-CTCTCTGAAGAAGAAGCAGCG-39; 59-CCGAGGGCACCATGGAGGCAGC-39. Nurr1: 59-GTGTTCAGGCGCAGTATGG-39; 59-TGGCAG TAATTTCAGTGTTGGT-39. BDNF: 59-TGTGGACCCTGAGTTCCACCAG-39; 59-CTGCCCTGGGCCCATTCACG-39. GDNF: 59-TGTGGACCCTGAGTTCCACCAG-39; 59CTGCCCTGGGCCCATTCACG-39. Pre-miR-132: 59-ACCGTGGCTTTCGATTGTTA-39; 59-GGCGACCATGGCTGTAGACT-39.
For semiquantitative RT-PCR, PCR reactions were carried out with 16
reaction buffer, 0.8 mM of each primer and 2.5 IU Taq DNA polymerase
(Fermentas, Lithuania). Samples were amplified in a Thermocycler (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA) under the following conditions: denaturing step at 95 ˚C for
40 seconds; annealing step at 56–60 ˚C for 30 seconds; and amplification step at
72 ˚C for 1 minute for 26–39 cycles. cDNA templates were normalized on the
basis of the actin-specific signal, and PCR cycling was adjusted so that each
primer set amplified its corresponding gene product at its detection threshold, to
avoid saturation effects.
We performed real-time PCR to quantify expression levels. PCR amplification
was performed in a mixture of 16 real-time PCR Master Mix and 0.8 mM of each
primer in a final volume of 50 ml. Thermocycling was conducted with an Opticon
DNA Engine (Bio-Rad). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were determined using the
Opticon Monitor 2 software and a manual fluorescence threshold for all runs, and
data were exported into an Excel workbook for analysis.
The PCR reactions consisted of 45 cycles using the following temperature
profile: 95 ˚C for 30 seconds, 56–60 ˚C for 30 seconds, 72 ˚C for 30 seconds and
79 ˚C for 5 seconds. The purity of each PCR product (defined as the presence of a
single, specific band) was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. A standard curve was
constructed using b-actin and plasmid DNA (102–107 molecules). The fluorescent
signals from specific PCR products were normalized against that of the b-actin
gene, and then relative values were calculated by setting the normalized value as
one for each gene. Two independent samples were analyzed for each gene, and all
reactions were repeated more than twice.
For the real-time PCR measurement of mature miR-132 expression in GFPpositive cells, we used the commercial reverse transcription and PCR primer kit
(RiboBio, Guangzhou, China). First, we established the standard curve of miR-132
using synthesized miR-132 (supplementary material Fig. S1). Then we measured
the Ct value of GFP-positive cells, primary ventral mesencephalon (VM) cultures,
GFP-negative cells and neural progenitor cells by real-time PCR, and calculated
the absolute levels of miR-132 according to the standard curve.
miRNA profiling using the ABI qPCR system

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA quality was
assessed with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA), and only
samples with an RNA integrity number greater than eight were used. For the
miRNA expression analysis, TaqMan Low Density Assay v2.0 (Applied
Biosystems) was used to detect up to 585 mouse miRNAs using an Applied
Biosystems real-time instrument, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Normalization was performed with snoRNA202 and snoRNA429 as endogenous
controls. Relative expression was calculated with the comparative Ct method
(Zhao, X. et al., 2010).
Dual luciferase reporter assay

The wild-type and mutant sequences, containing miR-132 binding sites, were
amplified and cloned into the 39 UTR region of the luciferase gene in the pGL3
luciferase vector (Promega), according to methods described previously. The
obtained construct was co-transfected with PRLSV40 and miR-132 mimics or NC
mimics (Genepharma) into HEK-293T and SK-N-SH cells, as previously
described. After 48 hours, luciferase activity was determined as the average of
three independent assays using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter system (Promega),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Western blotting

Cells were harvested at different time points according to the experimental
treatments and lysed for 20 minutes in freshly prepared ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer
[50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; NaCl 150 mM; 1% NP40; 0.25% sodium deoxycholate;
1 mM EDTA; 1 mM Na2VO4; 1 mM NaF; 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF); aprotinin and leupeptin 5 mg/ml each]. Lysates were then centrifuged
for 20 minutes at 16,000 g at 4 ˚C. After protein concentrations were measured
using the Bradford method, 40 mg protein from each sample was loaded onto a
12% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane,
blocked for 1 hour in 5% non-fat milk and incubated with primary antibodies
[anti-Nurr1 (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-b-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)] overnight at
4 ˚C. After being washed with Tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST),
samples were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The
immunoreactions were developed using Super SignalH West Dura Extended

1681

Duration Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, Pittsburgh, PA), and the signal was
quantified by measuring the optical density of the bands.
Immunocytochemistry

Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 minutes, rinsed with PBS, and then
incubated with blocking buffer [5% normal horse serum (Vector Labs,
Burlingame, CA)] for 30 minutes. Cells for immunofluorescent staining were
then incubated overnight at 4 ˚C with rabbit anti-TH antibody (1:1000, Chemicon),
mouse anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) antibody (1:1000, Sigma)
and mouse anti-nestin (1:800, Chemicon). After being rinsed three more times in
PBS, cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:800) and
Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:400; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor,
ME) for 2 hours at room temperature. After being rinsed for 36 10 minutes in
PBS, cells were incubated with Hoechst for 20 minutes and examined under a
fluorescence or confocal microscope.
TH-, GFP- and MAP2-positive cells were counted in a ‘blind’ fashion in five
random optical fields per coverslip by an unrelated investigator. Experiments were
performed on two independent cell cultures.
Statistical analysis

All values are shown as means 6 s.e.m. Data were analyzed using one-way
ANOVA followed by post-hoc LSD multiple comparisons or independent-samples
t-test with the SPSS 13.0 program (SPSS). A P-value of ,0.05 was considered
significant.
