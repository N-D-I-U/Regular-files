Nur-related factor 1 (Nurr1), nerve growth factor-induced
gene B (NGFI-B) and neuron-derived orphan receptor-1
(NOR-1) constitute the orphan nuclear receptor subfamily
of transcription factors. Previous studies showed that midbrain dopaminergic neuronal precursor cells failed to differentiate in Nurr1-deficient mice. To investigate a role of
Nurr1 in human neuronal function, Nurr1 mRNA expression was studied in human neural cell lines by RT-PCR
and northern blot analysis. Nurr1, NGFI-B and NOR-1
mRNA were coexpressed in all human neural and nonneural cell lines under the serum-containing culture condition, except for SK-N-SH neuroblastoma, in which Nurr1
mRNA was undetectable. The levels of Nurr1, NGFI-B
and NOR-1 mRNA were elevated markedly in NTera2 teratocarcinoma-derived neurons (NTera2-N), a model of differentiated human neurons, following a 1.5 or 3 h-exposure
to 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP or 100 nM phorbol 12myristate 13-acetate. NGFI-B mRNA levels were also
elevated in NTera2-N cells by exposure to 100 ng/mL
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). To identify
Nurr1-target genes, the mRNA expression of 27 genes
potentially involved in dopaminergic neuronal differentiation and survival, including BDNF, glia-derived neurotrophic factor, their receptors, tyrosine hydroxylase and
a-synuclein, were studied in HEK293 cells following overexpression of Nurr1. None of these genes examined, however, showed significant changes. These results indicate
that Nurr1, NGFI-B and NOR-1 mRNA are expressed

INTRODUCTION
Nur-related factor 1 (Nurr1, also termed NR4A2), nerve
growth factor-induced gene B (NGFI-B; NR4A1), and
neuron-related orphan receptor-1 (NOR-1; NR4A3) are
three closely related, highly homologous nuclear transcription factors of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor
superfamily, and they are designated as orphan nuclear
receptors (ONR) because of lack of their cognate
ligands.1,2 They are encoded by immediate early genes
which are rapidly induced by exposure of cells to the
serum, growth factors, cytokines, and peptide hormones,
suggesting a biological role of ONR in intracellular signal
transduction involved in cell growth, differentiation and
survival.3–6
Increasing evidence indicates that Nurr1 plays a pivotal
role in terminal differentiation of ventral mesencephalic
dopaminergic precursor neurons into a complete dopaminergic phenotype at later stages of development.7–17 Nurr1
is expressed most abundantly in neurons of limbic areas
and the ventral midbrain in the mouse and rat central nervous system (CNS).7–11 Nurr1, not NGFI-B or NOR-1, is
expressed in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra

220
(SN, A9) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA, A10) in
the developing and adult rodent CNS. Nurr1 expression is
identified in the mouse midbrain, starting from embryonic
day 10.5, that is, 1.5 days earlier than the appearance of
dopaminergic neurons. Most importantly, Nurr1 knockout
(Nurr1-/-) mice die shortly after birth because of hypoactivity, due to selective agenesis of dopaminergic neurons in
both SN and VTA.12–17 Although a population of dopaminergic precursor cells expressing the early dopaminergic
neuronal markers such as aldehyde dehydrogenase 2
(AHD2), engrailed (En), and a homeodomain transcription factor Ptx-3 develops in the ventral midbrain of
Nurr1-deficient mice, they could not terminally differentiate into fully mature dopaminergic neurons characterized
by the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), Laromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), dopamine
transporter (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter, and
dopamine receptors (DR) D1 and D2. Overexpression of
Nurr1, in combination with a diffusable factor derived
from type 1 astrocytes isolated from ventral mesencephalon, induces neural stem cells to develop into midbrain
dopaminergic neurons.18 Heterozygous Nurr1+/– mice survive postnatally without obvious movement abnormalities,
but they exhibit enhanced vulnerability to the selective
dopaminergic
neurotoxin
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).19 All of these observations
suggest that Nurr1 acts as a key transcriptional factor
crucial for a set of genes which are activated during differentiation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and maintenance of their function in adulthood. However, the
relevance of these findings to the pathogenesis of human
neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease
remains to be established because most previous studies
have focused on induction of Nurr1 expression in rodent
cells.20
The ONR family has a structure composed of an Nterminal variable domain containing the activation function 1 (AF1) region, a central DNA-binding domain
(DBD) with two conserved zinc finger motifs and
sequences termed P-box, D-box, T-box and A-box, and a
C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) containing a
leucine-zipper motif and the activation function 2 (AF2)
region.21,22 Nurr1 binds to a cis-acting regulatory sequence termed the NGFI-B-responsive element (NBRE;
5¢AAAGGTCA3¢) as a monomer, and also interacts with
a direct repeat of the consensus half-site sequence
(5¢AGGTCANNNAAAGGTCA3¢; DR5) as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), a universal
heterodimeric partner for the retinoic acid (RA) receptor,
thyroid hormone receptor, vitamin D receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor.9,23,24 NGFI-B can
also heterodimerize with RXR, whereas NOR-1 is unable
to form a stable heterodimer with RXR. Furthermore,

J-I Satoh and Y Kuroda
Nurr1 has a capacity to interact with the Nur77 response
element (NurRE), a palindromic element containing a
six-nucleotide spacing between two consensus half-site
sequences as a Nurr1 homodimer or a heterodimer with
NGFI-B or NOR-1.25,26 At present, only a few Nurr1 target
genes have been identified, one of which is the TH gene
that contains two NBRE-like sequences in its promoter
region.27,28
The aim of this study is (1) to investigate Nurr1 mRNA
expression in human neural cell lines (2) to clarify
upstream signals regulating Nurr1 mRNA expression in
human neurons, and (3) to identify the target genes regulated by Nurr1 in human cell lines.

METHODS
Human neural and non-neural cell lines
and tissues
The human neural and non-neural cell lines were obtained
from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan) and the
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD,
USA).29–32 They were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL of penicillin and
100 mg/mL of streptomycin (feeding medium). NTera2/
c.D1 (NTera2) is a pluripotent human teratocarcinomaderived clonal cell line. When maintained under standard
culture conditions, NTera2 cells have characteristics of
undifferentiated neuronal progenitor cells (NTera2-U),
while they differentiate into postmitotic neurons (NTera2N) after a 4-week treatment with 10-5 M all trans retinoic
acid (RA) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) followed by the
procedure of repeated replating, as described previously.29–32 The source of human cerebral and cerebellar tissues, peripheral nerve, and skeletal muscle was specified in
a previous study.30
For treatment of NTera2-N cells with growth/differentiation factors, the cells were washed once with the serumfree DMEM and incubated for 48 h in the serum-free
DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and selenium (ITS-G; Gibco-BRL/Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) (experiment medium), to exclude the
effects of the serum. Then, they were incubated further for
1.5 or 3 h in the serum-free experiment medium, supplemented with 100 ng/mL of recombinant human b-nerve
growth factor (NGF; PeproTech, London, UK), brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; PeproTech), or
glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF; PeproTech), or
100 nM of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma),
an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), 1 mM of dibutyryl
cyclic AMP (dbcAMP; Sigma), an activator of protein
kinase A (PKA), either in the presence or absence of

Nurr1 induction in human neurons
10 mg/mL cycloheximide (CHX; ICN Pharmaceuticals,
Costa Mesa, CA, USA), or 200 mM of SKF-82958 hydrobromide (Sigma), a full D1DR agonist, followed by processing for RNA preparation.

RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis
Total RNA was extracted from the cells and tissues by the
acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method
using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). DNase-treated
RNA samples were processed for cDNA synthesis using
oligo(dT)12-18 primers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a panel of sense and
antisense primer sets listed in Table 1. PCR was carried
out in 25 mL of reaction mixture containing Taq DNA
polymerase buffer and 0.625 U HotStar Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The amplification
program consisted of an initial denaturating step at 95 ∞C
for 15 min, followed by a denaturing step at 94 ∞C for
1 min, an annealing step at 60 ∞C for 40 s and an extension
step at 72.9 ∞C for 50 s for 40 cycles, except for the
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH)
gene that was amplified for 30 cycles. For Southern blot
analysis, the PCR products separated on a 1.5% agarose
gel were transferred onto a nylon membrane. The membranes were hybridized at 60 ∞C overnight with the internal oligonucleotide probe specific for the Nurr1 PCR
product (5¢TCGAAGCGCATCTGGCAACTAGAC3¢)
labeled with digoxigenin (DIG)-11-dUTP by the DIG
oligonucleotide tailing kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany) according to the methods described previously.29,30,32 The specific reaction was visualized by the DIG
chemiluminescence detection kit (Roche Diagnositics).

Northern blot analysis
For northern blot analysis, 3 mg of total RNA separated on
a 1.5% agarose-6% formaldehyde gel was transferred onto
a nylon membrane. After prehybridization, the membranes were hybridized at 54 ∞C overnight with the DIGlabeled DNA probe synthesized by the PCR DIG probe
synthesis kit (Roche Diagnositics) using the specific
primer sets (Table 1), followed by re-hybridization with
the DIG-labeled human b-actin antisense RNA probe
(Roche Diagnositics) as described previously.31–33 The
specific reaction was visualized on Kodak X-OMAT AR
X-ray films by the DIG chemiluminescence detection kit
(Roche Diagnositics). The densitometric analysis was performed on an imaging system using an NIH image Version
1.61 software. The levels of Nurr1, NGFI-B, and NOR-1
mRNA were standardized against the corresponding bactin mRNA signals detected on the identical blots as
described previously.31–33

Transfection and expression of Nurr1 gene
The entire open reading flame (ORF) of Nurr1 gene
(1797 bp) was amplified by PCR using PfuTurbo DNA
polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) and the
sense and antisense primer set (5¢ATGCCTTGTGTTCAGGCGCAGTAT3¢ and 5¢TTAGAAAGGTAAAGTGTCCAGGAA3¢). Then, it was cloned in a mammalian
expression vector pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO (Invitrogen),
which contains an N-terminal Xpress tag for detection of
the recombinant protein. The orientation of the cloned
genes was verified by direct sequencing analysis. Either the
vector containing Nurr1 ORF or the vector pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO/LacZ (Invitrogen) was transfected by using
Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) in a battery of
human neural and non-neural cell lines, which were incubated in the serum-free experiment medium for 24 h
before transfection. After incubating the cells in the
serum-free experiment medium for a further 96 h, they
were processed for preparation of both total RNA and
protein. The efficiency of transfection and expression was
determined in the cells transfected with pcDNA4/HisMaxTOPO/LacZ by b-Gal staining kit (Invitrogen).

Western blot analysis
To prepare total protein extract, the cells were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors;
Roche Diagnositics), followed by centrifugation at
15 000 rpm. for 20 min at room temperature (RT). The
supernatants were collected and 100 mg of protein extract
was separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel as described previously.32,34 They were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane followed by immunolabeling for 1 h at RT
with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the Xpress
epitope (1 : 4000; Invitrogen). Then, the membranes were
incubated for 1 h at RT with HRP-conjugated antimouse
IgG (1 : 1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).
The specific reaction was visualized by the enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) western blot detection system
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). After the
antibodies were stripped by incubation of the membranes
in stripping buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS,
100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) at 50 ∞C for 30 min, they were
processed for relabeling with a rabbit polyclonal antibody
against the mouse Nurr1 protein (1:1000; M-196, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) or with a goat polyclonal antibody
against the human 60-kDa heat shock protein (HSP60),
a housekeeping gene product (1:2000; N-20, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), followed by incubation with HRPconjugated antirabbit or antigoat IgG (1:2000, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).

G3PDH mRNA, a housekeeping gene, were almost constant among the cells and tissues examined (Fig. 1,
panel (e), lanes 2–15), while no products were amplified
when total RNA was processed for PCR without inclusion
of the reverse transcription (RT) step, confirming that a
contamination of genomic DNA was excluded (Fig. 1,
panels (a)-(e), lane 1). These results indicate that Nurr1,
NGFI-B and NOR-1 mRNA are coexpressed constitutively in various human neural and non-neural cell lines
under the serum-containing culture condition, suggesting
their fundamental role in diverse cell types.

cells expressed mRNA encoding a battery of dopaminergic neuron-associated molecules, such as synaptophysin, a-synuclein, synphilin-1, D1 dopamine receptor
(D1DR), and the long form of D2 dopamine receptor
(D2LDR) (Fig. 2, lanes 14,16,18,20,22). By contrast, no
products were amplified when total RNA was processed for PCR omitting the RT step (Fig. 2, lanes
1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21).

Nurr1, NGFI-B and NOR-1 mRNA expression is
up-regulated in NTera2-N cells by exposure to
PKA and PKC activators

Neurotrophic factor receptors are expressed in
NTera2-N cells, a model of differentiated
human neurons

In the next step, the extracellular stimuli inducing Nurr1,
NGFI-B, and NOR-1 mRNA expression were studied by
northern blot analysis in NTera2-N cells incubated in the
serum-free experiment medium to exclude any effects of
the serum. A very low level of Nurr1 mRNA expression
(3.8 kb) was identified in unstimulated NTera2-N cells
when incubated in the experiment medium without supplement of the serum (Fig. 3, left and right panels (a), lane
1). The levels of Nurr1 mRNA were elevated markedly in
NTera2-N cells after an 1.5 or 3 h treatment with 100 nM
PMA or 1 mM dbcAMP, when the levels of its expression
were standardized against corresponding b-actin mRNA
signals (1.8 kb) detected on the identical blots (Fig. 3, left

NTera2-N cells exhibiting extensive neurite outgrowth
represent a model system of differentiated human neurons

cells by RT-PCR analysis. They include the low-affinity
NGF receptor (LNGFR), tyrosine kinase receptors (trkA,
trkB, and trkC), GDNF receptor-a (GDNFRa), and the
receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) (Fig. 2, lanes 2,4,6,8,10,12),

were reduced at 6 h after initiation of the treatment (data
not shown). The inclusion of 10 mg/mL CHX in the
experiment medium containing 1 mM dbcAMP greatly
enhanced Nurr1 mRNA expression in NTera2-N cells,
indicating the superinduction of Nurr1 mRNA where no
de novo protein synthesis is required for its induction
(Fig. 3, left and right panels (a), lane 4).4,6 Treatment with
SKF-82958 hydrobromide, a full D1DR agonist at a concentration of 200 mM, induced a discernible level of Nurr1
mRNA expression in NTera2-N cells (Fig. 3, left and right

NGF, BDNF or GDNF did not significantly elevate Nurr1
mRNA levels (Fig. 4, left and right panels (a), lanes 1–4).
A low level of NGFI-B mRNA expression (2.8 kb) was
identified in unstimulated NTera2-N cells incubated in
the serum-free experiment medium (Fig. 3, left and right

elevated markedly in NTera2-N cells after a 1.5 or 3 htreatment with 100 nM PMA or 1 mM dbcAMP, most
robustly by treatment with 1 mM dbcAMP plus 10 mg/mL
CHX, and moderately by exposure to 200 mM SKF-82958

NOR-1 mRNA expression was not found in unstimulated NTera2-N cells when incubated in the serum-free
experiment medium (Fig. 3, left and right panels (c), lane
1). The levels of NOR-1 mRNA, composed of two distinct
transcripts (4.0 kb and 5.5 kb), were elevated markedly in
NTera2-N cells following a 1.5 or 3 h treatment with
100 nM PMA or 1 mM dbcAMP, most strongly induced by
treatment with 1 mM dbcAMP plus 10 mg/mL CHX, but
not by exposure to 200 mM SKF-82958 hydrobromide
(Fig. 3, left and right panels(c), lanes 2–5). Again, NOR-1
mRNA expression was not found in NTera2-N cells after
a 1.5 or 3 h treatment with 100 ng/mL NGF, BDNF or
GDNF (Fig. 4, left and right panels (c), lanes 1–4). The levels of synaptophysin mRNA (2.6 kb) remained unchanged
after exposure to PMA, dbcAMP, dbcAMP plus CHX,
SKF-82958 hydrobromide, NGF, BDNF or GDNF (Figs. 3
and 4, left and right panels (d), lanes 1–5). These results
indicate that Nurr1, NGFI-B and NOR-1 mRNA expression is coordinately up-regulated in NTera2-N cells following activation of the PKA or PKC pathway, while it is
regulated differentially by treatment with NGF, BDNF or

Finally, to identify the target genes whose expression is
regulated by Nurr1, the expression vector containing
either the ORF of Nurr1 gene or LacZ gene was transfected in HEK293, IMR-32, SK-N-SH, U-373MG or
NTera2-U cells, and then incubated for 96 h in the serumfree experiment medium to exclude any effects of the
serum. The expression of recombinant Nurr1 protein
(70 kDa) or LacZ (120 kDa) was identified in HEK293
cells at 96 h after transfection (Fig. 5, left and right
panels (a)-(c), lanes 2,4), with the transfection efficiency
being over 80% determined by b-Gal staining of HEK293
cells transfected with the LacZ gene expression vector
(data not shown). Neither Nurr1 mRNA nor Nurr1 protein were found to be expressed in non-transfected
HEK293 cells under the serum-free culture condition

vations indicate that the induction of Nurr1 alone is insufficient for transcriptional activation of Nurr1 target genes
in HEK293 cells.

DISCUSSION
The present study by using RT-PCR analysis has shown
that Nurr1, NGFI-B and NOR-1 mRNA were coexpressed
constitutively in various human neural and non-neural cell
lines incubated in culture medium containing 10% FBS, a
potent inducer for ONR expression.3,4,41 These findings are
apparently inconsistent with a previous study by northern
blot analysis showing that Nurr1 mRNA is undetectable in

both IMR-32 cells and HeLa cells under the serumcontaining culture condition,4 although this discrepancy is
derived from the different sensitivities of the methods
employed. Importantly, in spite of the widespread expression, targeted disruption of Nurr1 gene specifically inhibits
terminal differentiation of midbrain dopaminergic neuronal precursor cells.12–17 We found that the levels of
Nurr1, NGFI-B and NOR-1 mRNA were elevated rapidly
in NTera2-N cells, a model of differentiated human neurons, following exposure to dbcAMP or PMA without
requirement of de novo protein synthesis, indicating that
they represent immediate early-response genes.4,6 We
investigated the expression of 27 genes in HEK293 cells
after overexpression of Nurr1, including the genes potentially involved in dopaminergic neuronal differentiation
and survival. However, none of them showed significant
alterations. Unexpectedly, HEK293 cells, a prototype of
non-neural cell lines, expressed constitutively mRNA coding for a-synuclein, BDNF, LNGFR, FGFR-1 and GDNFRa, all of which play important roles in differentiation of
dopaminergic neurons. These observations indicate that
Nurr1, NGFI-B and NOR-1 mRNA expression is upregulated in human neurons following activation of PKA
or PKC pathway, and suggest that the induction of
Nurr1 alone might be insufficient for transcriptional activation of Nurr1-target genes in HEK293 cells. Previous
studies showed that treatment with forskolin or 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) elevates Nurr1,
NGFI-B, and NOR-1 mRNA levels in human and rodent
neural and non-neural cells,5,6 supporting the present
observations.
Recent studies showed that the promoter region of
human Nurr1 gene has cis-acting regulatory elements
activated through PKA or PKC pathways, such as a cyclic
AMP-responsive element (CRE) and a consensus
sequence for nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB).42,43 Nurr1,
NGFI-B and NOR-1 differ not only in the spatial and temporal distribution, but also in the inducibility in response
to various stimuli.6,9 NGFI-B was originally identified as a
gene induced by NGF in the rat pheochromocytoma cell
line PC12.44 Unlike NGFI-B, Nurr1 is not induced in PC12
cells by NGF treatment, while the expression of both
NGFI-B and Nurr1 is triggered by potassium-induced
depolarization of PC12 cells.1,44 We found that NGFI-B
mRNA expression was up-regulated in NTera2-N cells
preferentially by exposure to BDNF. BDNF elevates intracellular cyclic AMP levels in cultured cerebellar and hippocampal neurons,45,46 suggesting a possible involvement
of PKA pathway in BDNF-induced NGFI-B expression in
NTera2-N cells, although a recent study indicated that
BDNF stimulates c-fos mRNA transcription in cerebellar
neurons through activation of CRE, but independently of
the PKA pathway.47 The CRE sequence is also identified

following cerebral ischemia.52 Nurr1 mRNA expression is
up-regulated in neurons of rat hippocampal dentate gyrus
following kainic acid-induced and electroconvulsive seizures.53,54 These observations suggest that diverse neuronal
activity-dependent stimuli promptly induce Nurr1 expression in defined populations of neurons. Nurr1, NGFI-B
and NOR-1 are also found to be expressed abundantly
in tissues of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
axis, where both Nurr1 and NGFI-B activate the transcription of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and
proopiomelanocortin (POMC) genes, suggesting a fundamental role of ONR in regulation of neuroendocrine
function.55–58
The NBRE-like sequences have been identified in promoter regions of the genes encoding CRH, POMC, steroid
21-hydroxylase, cholesterol desmolase, DAT, TH, NGF,
BDNF, vasopressin, oxytocin, CRABP-II, apolipoproteins C-III and B-100, prealbumin, acyl-coenzyme A oxidase, alkaline phosphatase, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin,
type I collagen, collagenase, insulin-like growth factor I,
acetylcholine receptor and N-myc.15,27,28,39,40,58–60 Furthermore, previous studies suggest that the expression of both
GDNFRb and RET genes is regulated by Nurr1 in mouse
neural cells.18,61 However, we found that the expression of
mRNA encoding TH, NGF, BDNF, GDNFRb, RET or
CRABP-II was not affected by overexpression of Nurr1 in
HEK293 cells. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that HEK293 cells might lack auxiliary proteins
acting as a coactivator for transcription of Nurr1-target

genes in dopaminergic neuronal precursor cells.21,22,24 The
expression of Nurr1 protein was not identified in IMR-32,
SK-N-SH, U-373MG or NTera2-U cells after transfection
of the expression vector, hampering the use of neural cell
lines as a preferable source to identify Nurr1-target genes.
The lack of Nurr1 expression in these cell lines is attributable either to the lower transfection efficiency or to the
reduced activity of promoter elements of the vector in certain cell types.
Another possibility could be proposed that HEK293
cells which do not express RXRa, a heterodimeric partner
for Nurr1 and NGFI-B,9,23,24 are not fully competent for
transcriptional activation of Nurr1-target genes. However,
a recent study indicates that Nurr1, without formation
of a heterodimer with RXR, promotes differentiation of
dopaminergic MN9D cells.62 Nurr1, NGFI-B, and NOR-1
exhibit different selectivities for the NBRE-responsive
genes and the LBD of Nurr1 influences the ability to activate transcription of the target genes, depending on cell
type and mode of DNA binding.21,63 Nurr1 activates transcription of the human DAT gene in a mouse dopaminergic neuronal cell line by acting as a coactivator of an
undefined protein.64 By contrast, Nurr1 represses transcription of the glutamate receptor ionotropic kainate 5
(GIRK5) gene by binding to a small intronic element.65
Furthermore, post-translational modifications of Nurr1
protein might affect transcriptional activation of the target
genes.4,56 All of these observations indicate that the mechanisms underlying Nurr1-mediated transcriptional regula-

230

tion are highly complex, involving NBRE-independent
mechanisms.
In conclusion, Nurr1 mRNA expression is up-regulated
in differentiated human neurons following activation of
PKA or PKC pathway, suggesting that diverse extracellular stimuli activate transcription of Nurr1 in human neurons, although its target genes remain to be identified.
