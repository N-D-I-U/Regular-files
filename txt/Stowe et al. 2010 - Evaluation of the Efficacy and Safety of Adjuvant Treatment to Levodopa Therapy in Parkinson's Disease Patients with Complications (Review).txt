ABSTRACT
Background
One of the complications of long-term treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) with levodopa is the development of motor complications.
Generally, when motor complications develop, clinicians add in an additional drug (to the levodopa regimen) from one of three other
classes of anti-Parkinsonian treatments (dopamine agonists, catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors (COMTIs) or monoamine oxidase
type B inhibitors (MAOBIs)). However, despite trials having shown that these drugs are beneficial compared to placebo, it remains
unclear as to the best way to treat patients experiencing motor complications and whether one class of drug is more effective than
another.
Objectives
This meta-analysis aims to assess more reliably the benefits and risks of the three classes of drugs (dopamine agonists, COMTIs and
MAOBIs) currently used as adjuvant treatment to levodopa in PD patients suffering from motor complications. The three drug classes
were compared with the aim of determining whether one class of drug provides better symptomatic control than another.
Search methods
We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, LILACS and Web of Science, plus major journals
in the field, abstract books, conference proceedings and reference lists of retrieved publications.
Selection criteria
Randomised trials comparing an orally administered dopamine agonist, COMTI or MAOBI versus placebo, both on a background of
levodopa therapy, in PD patients experiencing motor complications.

Data collection and analysis
Two authors independently extracted data on off-time, levodopa dose, motor complications, side-effects, treatment concordance,
clinician-rated disability, mortality, quality of life and health economic data.
Main results
Forty-four eligible trials, involving 8436 participants were identified. Compared to placebo, adjuvant therapy significantly reduced offtime (-1.05 hours/day, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.19 to -0.90; P<0.00001), the required levodopa dose (-55.65 mg/day, CI 62.67 to -48.62; P<0.00001) and improved UPDRS scores (UPDRS ADL score: -1.31 points, CI -1.62 to -0.99; P<0.00001; UPDRS
motor score: -2.84 points, CI -3.36 to -2.32; P<0.00001; UPDRS total score: -3.26 points, CI -4.52 to -2.00; P<0.00001). However,
dyskinesia (odds ratio (OR) 2.50, CI 2.21 to 2.84; P<0.00001) and side-effects including constipation (OR 3.19, CI 2.17 to 4.68;
P<0.00001), dizziness (OR 1.57, CI 1.30 to 1.90; P<0.00001), dry mouth (OR 2.33, CI 1.22 to 4.47; P=0.01), hallucinations (OR
2.16, CI 1.70 to 2.74; P<0.00001), hypotension (OR 1.47, CI 1.18 to 1.83; P=0.0007), insomnia (OR 1.38, CI 1.09 to 1.74; P=
0.007), nausea (OR 1.78, CI 1.53 to 2.07; P<0.00001), somnolence (OR 1.87, CI 1.40 to 2.51; P<0.0001) and vomiting (OR 2.56,
CI 1.67 to 3.93; P<0.0001) were all increased with adjuvant therapy.
Indirect comparisons of the three drug classes suggested that dopamine agonists were more efficacious in reducing off-time (dopamine
agonist: -1.54 hours/day; COMTI: -0.83 hours/day; MAOBI: -0.93 hours/day; test for heterogeneity between drug classes P=0.0003)
and levodopa dose (dopamine agonist: -116 mg/day; COMTI: -52 mg/day; MAOBI: -29 mg/day; test for heterogeneity between drug
classes P<0.00001). UPDRS scores also improved more with dopamine agonists than with COMTI or MAOBI (UPDRS total scores dopamine agonist: -10.01 points versus COMTI: -1.46 points versus MAOBI: -2.20 points; test for heterogeneity between drug classes
P<0.00001), although more dyskinesia were seen with dopamine agonists (OR 2.70) and COMTI (OR 2.50) than with MAOBI (OR
0.94) (test for heterogeneity between drug classes P=0.009). Although the increase in the overall incidence of side-effects was generally
more marked with dopamine agonists (OR 1.52) and COMTI (OR 2.0) than with MAOBI (OR 1.32), heterogeneity between drug
classes was only of borderline significance (P=0.07).
Authors’ conclusions
Compared to placebo, adjuvant therapy reduces off-time, levodopa dose, and improves UPDRS scores in PD patients who develop
motor complications on levodopa therapy. However, this is at the expense of increased dyskinesia and numerous other side-effects.
Indirect comparisons suggest that dopamine agonist therapy may be more effective than COMTI and MAOBI therapy, which have
comparable efficacy. However, as indirect comparisons should be interpreted with caution, direct head-to-head randomised trials
assessing the impact of these different drug classes on overall patient-rated quality of life are needed.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY
Drugs for motor complications in people with Parkinson´ s disease who are already taking levodopa
One of the complications of long-term treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) with levodopa is the development of motor complications
e.g. dyskinesia; a jerky, dance-like movement of the body. Generally clinicians add on drugs (to the levodopa regimen) from one
of the other three classes of anti-Parkinsonian treatments available (e.g. dopamine agonists, catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors
(COMTIs) or monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors (MAOBIs)). However, despite trials having shown that these drugs are beneficial
compared to placebo, it remains unclear as to the best way to treat patients experiencing motor complications and, in particular, whether
one class of drug may be more effective than another.
This review assesses data from randomised trials of the three classes of drugs commonly used as add-on (adjuvant) treatment to
levodopa therapy in people with PD who have motor complications. Forty-four randomised trials, involving 8436 participants were
identified as suitable for this review. The review confirms reports from individual trials that, compared to placebo, add-on therapy (on a
background of levodopa) significantly reduces patient off-time, reduces the required levodopa dose and improves overall disability scores
(measured on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale - UPDRS). However, dyskinesia and other side-effects such as constipation,
hallucinations and vomiting are increased with adjuvant therapy.
Indirect comparisons of the three drug classes (dopamine agonists, COMTIs and MAOBIs) suggest that dopamine agonists may provide
more effective symptomatic control than COMTI and MAOBI therapy. COMTI and MAOBI have comparable efficacy. There was
no significant evidence of differences in efficacy between individual drugs within the drug classes, other than tolcapone appearing

more effective than entacapone. However these observations are based on indirect comparisons between trials, so could be due to other
factors, e.g. differences in the types of people included in the trials, and so should to be interpreted with caution.
This review highlights the need for large randomised studies that directly compare the different drug classes with patient-rated overall
quality of life and health economic measures as the primary outcomes.

BACKGROUND
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive disorder affecting over six
million people worldwide, making it the most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease (Schapira 1999). With
a growing elderly population and a reduction in other causes of
mortality, the prevalence of PD is likely to increase (Quinn 1997).
In the absence of curative therapy, treatment is directed towards alleviating the characteristic symptoms of PD such as bradykinesia,
tremor, rigidity and postural instability (Clarke 2002). Levodopa
combined with a peripheral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor provides
effective symptomatic control. However, it is now well established
that most patients who are treated with levodopa in the early stages
of PD, particularly at higher doses, develop motor complications
such as abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesia) and motor
fluctuations (early wearing-off after each dose of medication and
unpredictable switching between the mobile ’on’ phase and the
relatively immobile ’off ’ phase). Once motor complications have
developed on levodopa therapy, clinicians add on other classes of
anti-Parkinsonian drugs such as dopamine agonists, catechol-Omethyl transferase inhibitors (COMTIs) or monoamine oxidase
type B inhibitors (MAOBIs). This is referred to as ’add-on’, ’adjuvant’ or ’adjunct’ therapy in later PD. Previous randomised controlled trials have shown that these drugs can reduce a patient’s
off-time, reduce the required levodopa dose and improve motor
function. However, there is uncertainty whether one add-on drug
class is more effective than another, and a meta-analysis of the
randomised evidence would be useful to clinicians and patients to
help inform the best order in which to use these drugs.

OBJECTIVES
This ’umbrella’ meta-analysis aims to compare the effectiveness
and safety of the three main classes of add-on drugs that are used
in the management of patients with later PD. We have undertaken a meta-analysis of data from all published randomised trials
comparing any orally administered dopamine agonist, COMTI
or MAOBI with placebo in patients with PD who are already established on levodopa and suffering from motor complications to
quantify more reliably the evidence-base and to determine whether

one class of drug provides better symptomatic control than another.
Thus, this review both complements previous individual reviews
by updating and clarifying the existing evidence-base, and provides
important information on possible class effects of add-on therapy
in later PD.

METHODS

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies
Eligible studies were any randomised trials (including the first
phase of crossover trials) in later PD comparing an orally administered dopamine agonist, COMTI or MAOBI versus placebo, both
on a background of levodopa therapy, with all other aspects of
planned treatment being the same in both arms.

Types of participants
Studies with PD patients (diagnosed by the enrolling investigators)
receiving levodopa and who had developed motor complications.
All durations of levodopa therapy were included. There were no
age restrictions.

Types of interventions
Any orally administered dopamine agonist, COMTI or MAOBI
(on a background of levodopa) versus placebo (also on a background of levodopa), with all other aspects of planned treatment
being the same in both arms.
When this literature search was performed only three trials of
transdermal skin patch agonists (rotigotine and piribedil) were
identified (DA (Pi): Toulouse; DA (Ro): CLEOPATRA; DA (Ro):
PREFER) (See Characteristics of excluded studies). These trials
were excluded at this stage as (1) transdermal administered agents

may have different properties to oral preparations and (2) transdermal patches were not widely used at that time. In 2008, manufacturing problems with the rotigotine patch led to supply problems, meaning that initiation was not possible in most countries
for a while and is still not possible in some. However, trials of
transdermal patch agents will be included in the next update of
this review.

Types of outcome measures
Outcome measures were time spent in the ’off ’ state, levodopa
dose, changes in clinician-rated disability scales, e.g. Unified
Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the incidence of dyskinesia and dystonia, frequency of adverse events, mortality, treatment compliance and withdrawals, quality of life and health economic data.

Search methods for identification of studies
See: Cochrane Movements Disorders Group methods used in reviews.
We undertook a systematic search of the literature up to the end
of 2008 for publications or abstracts describing relevant trials.
This included searching electronic databases such as the Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane
Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, LILACS and Web of
Science. Ongoing and recently completed trials were identified by
searching the Meta Register of Controlled Clinical Trials (mRCT).
This electronic search was supplemented by handsearching of general (Lancet, BMJ, JAMA) and major journals (Movement Disorders, Neurology) in the field and abstract books and conference proceedings from the main society meetings (International
Congress of Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders, World
Congress on Parkinson’s Disease and Related Disorders) to identify trials not yet indexed on the main databases and new trials presented as abstracts at meetings. Further information was
sought from scanning reference lists of retrieved papers, in particular review papers and searching for grey literature (e.g. dissertations, government reports). Authors of trials were contacted for
further information as required. Additional assistance including
information on unpublished data was requested from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Randomised controlled trials were identified
using the highly sensitive search strategy as recommended by The
Cochrane Collaboration (Dickersin 1994), combined with added
terms for Parkinson’s disease (Parkinson’s disease, parkinson*) and
all adjuvant agents (dopamine agonist*, bromocriptine*, ropinirole*, cabergoline*, lisuride*, pergolide*, piribedil*, MAOB*, selegiline*, rasagiline*, COMT*, tolcapone*, entacapone*) (using
free text or MESH terms, or both, where appropriate).

Data collection and analysis
Study Selection
From the search results, two review authors independently
screened the abstracts of potentially relevant studies, with the full
paper being obtained if the abstract did not provide sufficient information to determine eligibility for inclusion in the review. Disagreement was resolved by referral to a third review author.
Data Extraction
Two review authors independently assessed the eligible papers or
abstracts for trial details and outcome data. This was validated by a
third review author with any discrepancies resolved by consensus.
Trial details were recorded on a standard trial description form
and included: trial name, trial group, principal investigators and
authors, randomised comparison, treatment schedule (including
dose, duration, route), other therapy, eligibility criteria, method of
randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, accrual period,
number of participants randomised, number of drop outs, duration of follow-up, analysis methods, outcomes planned, outcomes
reported, use of intention-to-treat analysis and publication date(s).
Outcome data extracted included data on off-time, levodopa dose,
clinician-rated disability scales, e.g. UPDRS, dyskinesia, dystonia,
adverse events, mortality, treatment compliance and withdrawals,
quality of life and health economic data.
Data Analysis
Results of each trial were combined using standard meta-analytic
methods to estimate an overall effect for adjuvant treatment versus
control (placebo-treated) participants. For event data (e.g. mortality), estimates of the treatment effects were obtained for most
trials from the number of events reported in each arm and combined using the methods of Mantel and Haenszel (Mantel 1959;
Peto 1977). This involved comparing the number of events observed (O) with the number of events that would have been expected (E) if the probability of that event was unrelated to treatment. For each trial the ’observed minus expected’ (O-E) difference and its variance was calculated for the treatment arm, then
used to calculate odds ratios together with 95% confidence intervals (EBCTCG 1990). If an odds ratio, hazard ratio, relative risk
or odds reduction, plus a confidence interval or a P value, were
stated in the publication then this information was used to obtain
a more accurate estimate of the treatment effect (Parmar 1998).
Summing the statistics for each trial provides the overall statistics,
which were then used to calculate reductions in the odds of each
event, for example dyskinesia or death.
For continuous variables (e.g. levodopa dose), we calculated the
mean differences (Fleiss 1993). For each trial the difference between the outcome measure means for each treatment group was
calculated, along with its variance. These values were combined to
give the overall mean difference and its standard error, with 95%
confidence interval for this pooled estimate of the mean difference.
If any trials with three or more treatment arms were identified,
then the following assumptions were made for the analysis:
1. If the trial was comparing two different drugs within the same

complications (Review)

drug class versus control , then the data for those drugs were combined to give one comparison of adjuvant therapy versus control.
2. If the trial was comparing the same drug but at different doses
versus control, then the arm using the licensed or generally recommended dose was chosen for inclusion in the analysis.
This meant that trials were not included multiple times in the
analysis, and the control arms from each trial were counted only
once in the analysis.
The primary outcome measure was mean off-time reduction, with
secondary outcome measures of levodopa dose reduction, changes
in clinician-rated disability scales, e.g. UPDRS, the incidence of
dyskinesia and dystonia, frequency of adverse events, mortality,
treatment compliance and withdrawals, quality of life and health
economic data.
The three adjuvant drug classes compared in this meta-analysis
have different mechanisms of action: dopamine agonists directly
stimulate post-synaptic dopamine receptors; COMTIs inhibit the
metabolism of levodopa mainly in the periphery, but in the case
of tolcapone, in the brain; and MAOBIs inhibit the metabolism
of intracerebral dopamine. Given these different mechanisms of
action, the adjuvant trials included in this meta-analysis were divided according to drug class:
Dopamine agonist versus placebo (both on a background of levodopa therapy)
COMTI versus placebo (both on a background of levodopa therapy)
MAOBI versus placebo (both on a background of levodopa therapy).
To assess for differences across the three add-on drug classes (interclass comparisons), indirect comparisons using tests for heterogeneity were used to investigate whether the treatment effect
differed across the different drug classes (EBCTCG 1990; Deeks
2001). These tests may suggest the possible superiority of one drug
class over another, and may provide clinicians and patients with
more reliable information upon which to base decisions about addon drug therapy. We also used tests for heterogeneity to indirectly
investigate for differences between the drugs used within each of
the add-on drug classes (intraclass comparisons). As with all subgroup comparisons, these analyses should be interpreted with caution and should be considered hypothesis generating (Assmann
2000; Clarke 2001).
No other subgroup analyses were planned or performed.

RESULTS

Description of studies
See: Characteristics of included studies; Characteristics of excluded
studies; Characteristics of ongoing studies.

Seventy-eight randomised trials of adjuvant therapy using either
a dopamine agonist, MAOBI or COMTI (on a background of
levodopa) in PD patients experiencing motor complications were
identified. Thirty-four studies were excluded (See Characteristics
of excluded studies) - eighteen trials of dopamine agonist, seven of
COMTI and nine of MAOBI. The reasons for excluding these trials were crossover study with data not presented for the first treatment period (n=16), patients with later PD but it was not clear if
they were all suffering from motor complications (n=8), partial or
skin patch agonist (n=5), not clear if properly randomised (n=2),
single-dose study (n=2) and drug administered using intravenous
infusion (also no outcome data reported) (n=1). There was also
one trial comparing pramipexole versus rotigotine versus placebo
(CLEOPATRA). For this trial, the comparison of the transdermal
patch rotigotine versus placebo was excluded from this analysis
(but will be included in the next update of the review) (DA (Ro):
CLEOPATRA). The literature search also identified eight publications that were related to five studies (COMTI (T): TFSG 3; DA
(C): USA 1; DA (Pe): N America; DA (Pr): US/Canada; MAOBI
(S): USA) already included in the meta-analysis, with these additional publications reporting the results on a subset of participants
from the main trial. To avoid duplication of results, data from
these additional publications were not included in the analysis.
Therefore, there were forty-four trials eligible for inclusion in the
review.
The number of participants randomised into the forty-four trials
included in this meta-analysis ranged from 23 to 687 participants,
with 8436 randomised participants in total (giving an average trial
size of less than 200 participants) (See Characteristics of included
studies). The average length of follow-up was 20 weeks (range: 4
weeks to 2 years), and the majority of studies (36/44, 82%) were
of six months or less in duration of follow-up. The mean age of the
participants in the trials was approximately 63 years, 60% were
male and they had had PD for approximately 9 years.
There was one three-arm trial comparing two dopamine agonists
(bromocriptine and pramipexole) with placebo, for this trial the
data from the two agonist arms were combined to give one comparison of dopamine agonist versus placebo (DA (Pr/B): Interntl). In
the COMTI trials, there were seven trials with three or more arms.
These were generally trials comparing different doses of COMTI
treatment versus placebo. In these cases, where possible, the arm
using the licensed or generally recommended dose of the drug (entacapone 200mg with each levodopa dose and tolcapone 100mg
t.i.d) was chosen for inclusion in the data analysis. Thus for the
COMTI (E): Japan trial comparing entacapone 100mg or 200mg
versus placebo, the 200mg arm (with each levodopa dose) was
included in the analysis; for the COMTI (T): Europe, COMTI
(T): TFSG 3 and COMTI (T): US/Canada trials comparing tolcapone 100mg t.i.d. or 200mg t.i.d. versus placebo, the 100mg
t.i.d arms were included in the analysis; for the COMTI (T): TFSG
1 and COMTI (T): TIPS I trials comparing tolcapone 50mg t.i.d.,
200mg t.i.d. or 400mg t.i.d. versus placebo, the 200mg t.i.d. arms

were included in the analysis; and for the COMTI (T): TIPS
II trial comparing tolcapone 200mg t.i.d. or 400mg t.i.d. versus
placebo, the 200mg t.i.d. arm was included in the analysis. In the
MAOBI trials, there was one three-arm trial comparing 0.5mg or
1mg rasagiline versus placebo (MAOBI (R): PRESTO), and one
four-arm trial comparing 0.5mg, 1mg or 2mg rasagiline versus
placebo (MAOBI (R): Isra/Hun), with the 1mg arm (the licensed
dose for rasagiline) from both trials being included in the analysis. There were also two trials that included both fluctuating and
non-fluctuating patients, where the results were split by type of
patient, so only the fluctuating patients were included in the analysis (COMTI (E): UK/Irish; MAOBI (R): Isra/Hun). Thus, of
the 8436 participants randomised into the forty-four trials, 7590
(90%) participants were included in the analysis.
There was one three-arm trial that contributed data to two add-on
drug class comparisons (COMTI (E): LARGO). This was a trial
of the COMTI entacapone versus the MAOBI rasagiline versus
placebo, which contributed to both the COMTI versus placebo
and MAOBI versus placebo add-on drug class comparisons. There
were therefore, forty-four trials contributing to forty-five comparisons within the three add-on drug classes - twenty comparisons of dopamine agonist versus placebo, eighteen comparisons of
COMTI versus placebo and seven comparisons of MAOBI versus
placebo. In the dopamine agonist trials, pramipexole was being
assessed in seven trials, bromocriptine in five, cabergoline in four,
ropinirole in four and pergolide in one (note: DA (Pr/B): Interntl
had two agonist arms - bromocriptine and pramipexole). There
were eleven trials assessing the COMTI entacapone and seven assessing the COMTI tolcapone, and for the MAOBI trials, there
were three trials of rasagiline and four of selegiline (two of deprenyl
(selegiline) and two of zydis selegiline (sublingual - Zelapar using
the Zydis fast-dissolving technology)).

Risk of bias in included studies
None of the available trial quality scoring systems are widely accepted, so these were not used in this review. The Characteristics of
included studies and Risk of bias in included studies tables shows
some aspects of the methodological quality of the included trials.
Twenty-six trials (of the 44 eligible trials included in this metaanalysis) described the method of randomisation used (for example, random number generator, computer generated), but only
five trials gave information that allowed the assessment of whether
an adequate concealment of allocation procedure (by virtue of a
central randomisation service) was used. All trials were doubleblind, placebo-controlled and all trials reported follow-up data,
although it was often unclear whether all randomised participants
were included in the analyses, despite analyses being described as
intention-to-treat.

Effects of interventions
Off-Time Reduction (Analysis 1.1 to Analysis 1.4)
Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy versus Placebo ( Analysis 1.1;
Figure 1 )
Data on off-time reduction were available from twenty-nine (of
the 44) trials for thirty comparisons, with fifteen (out of 20) trials of dopamine agonists, twelve (out of 18) trials of COMTI
and three (out of 7) trials of MAOBI. There were 5331 participants included in the analysis which represented 70% of the 7590
participants included in the meta-analysis. Compared to placebo,
adjuvant therapy (on a background of levodopa) significantly reduced off-time by approximately one hour a day (mean reduction -1.05 hours/day, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.19 to -0.90;
P<0.00001; Analysis 1.1; Figure 1). There was however significant
heterogeneity between trials (P=0.0002) and between the three
add-on drug classes (test for heterogeneity between drug classes,
P=0.0003).

Interclass Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy ( Analysis 1.1;
Figure 1 )
Although (compared to placebo) all three adjuvant therapy drug
classes significantly reduced patients’ off-time, there was significant heterogeneity between the three add-on drug classes (test for
heterogeneity between drug classes, P=0.0003), suggesting that
there may be differences in off-time reduction across the different drug classes. Indirect comparisons of the three drug classes
suggested that dopamine agonists (-1.54 hours/day, CI -1.83 to 1.26; P<0.00001; Analysis 1.1; Figure 1) reduced off-time more
than COMTI (-0.83 hours/day, CI -1.04 to -0.62; P<0.00001)
and MAOBI (-0.93 hours/day, CI -1.25 to -0.62; P<0.00001).
Intraclass Comparison of Drugs used as Adjuvant Therapy (
Analysis 1.2 to Analysis 1.4 )
A comparison of the different drugs used as adjuvant therapy
found that although dopamine agonists produced the greatest
overall reduction in off-time (-1.54 hours/day), there was no evidence of a difference across the different dopamine agonists for
which data were available (test for heterogeneity between drugs,
P=0.15). The greatest reductions in off-time were observed with
pramipexole (-1.81 hours/day, CI -2.19 to -1.43; P<0.00001;
Analysis 1.2) followed by bromocriptine (-1.78 hours/day, CI 2.91 to -0.65; P=0.002); pergolide (-1.60 hours/day, CI -2.57 to
-0.63; P=0.001); cabergoline (-1.29 hours/day, CI -1.89 to -0.69;
P<0.0001) and ropinirole (-0.93 hours/day, CI -1.53 to -0.33; P=
0.002). Similarly, there was no difference in off-time reduction
between the MAOBIs rasagiline (-0.84 hours/day, CI -1.17 to 0.50; P<0.00001; Analysis 1.4) and sublingual selegiline (-1.60
hours/day, CI -2.47 to -0.73; P=0.0003) (test for heterogeneity
between drugs, P=0.11). In contrast, for the two COMTIs (enta-

capone and tolcapone) there was evidence of a difference between
the two drugs (test for heterogeneity between drugs, P=0.0001),
with participants randomised to tolcapone getting an extra hour of
on-time (-1.60 hours/day, CI -2.04 to -1.15; P<0.00001; Analysis
1.3) compared to those randomised to entacapone (-0.61 hours/
day, CI -0.85 to -0.37; P<0.00001).
Levodopa Dose Reduction (Analysis 2.1 to Analysis 2.4)
Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy versus Placebo ( Analysis 2.1;
Figure 2 )
Data on levodopa dose were available from twenty-eight (of the
44) trials. Two of these trials stated that the levodopa dose should
remain constant throughout the trial (DA (C): UK; DA (Pr):
Aust/Germ). Since these trials were not trying to reduce the levodopa dose, they were excluded from this analysis. This left twentysix trials for twenty-seven comparisons, with nine (out of 20) trials of dopamine agonist, fifteen (out of 18) trials of COMTI and
three (out of 7) trials of MAOBI. All these trials allowed changes in
levodopa dose, though some requested that the dose be kept stable
in the period prior to an assessment point. One trial stated that
the levodopa dose should be kept stable for the first six weeks of
the trial, and then the dose could be reduced (DA (R): UK/Israel),
and two other trials stated that changes in levodopa dose were allowed only in the first 6 weeks of the trial (MAOBI (R): LARGO;
MAOBI (R): PRESTO). An analysis excluding these trials made
little difference to the results, so these three trials were included.
There were 4628 participants included in the analysis, which accounted for 61% of the 7590 randomised participants included in
this meta-analysis. The required mean daily dose of levodopa was
reduced with adjuvant therapy (compared to placebo) by 55.65
mg/day (CI -62.67 to -48.62; P<0.00001; Analysis 2.1; Figure 2).

Figure 2. Levodopa Dose Reduction (mg/day) (Adjuvant Therapy versus Placebo).

Interclass Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy ( Analysis 2.1;
Figure 2 )
As with off-time reduction, although all three adjuvant therapy drug classes significantly reduced the required daily dose
of levodopa, there were again differences across the different add-on drug classes (test for heterogeneity between drug
classes, P<0.00001), with greater reductions in levodopa dose
with dopamine agonists (-116.03 mg/day, CI -134.45 to -97.61;
P<0.00001; Analysis 2.1; Figure 2) compared with both COMTI
(-52.07 mg/day, CI -61.09 to -43.05; P<0.00001) and MAOBI (29.11 mg/day, CI -43.18 to -15.04; P<0.0001).
Intraclass Comparison of Drugs used as Adjuvant Therapy (
Analysis 2.2 to Analysis 2.4 )
The greatest reductions in required levodopa dose were observed
with dopamine agonists (-116.03 mg/day), but there was little

evidence of a difference between the various dopamine agonists
used (test for heterogeneity between drugs, P=0.03). The largest
reduction in levodopa dose was seen with pergolide (-183.90 mg/
day, CI -259.09 to -72.71; P=0.001; Analysis 2.2), though this
was based on data from just one trial (DA (Pe): N America).
Cabergoline reduced the required levodopa dose by 149.60 mg/
day (CI -208.79 to -90.41; P<0.00001), ropinirole by 119.81 mg/
day (CI -150.63 to -89.00; P<0.00001), pramipexole by 114.82
mg/day (CI -143.01 to -86.64; P<0.00001) and bromocriptine by
52.17 mg/day (CI -95.16 to -9.18; P=0.02). There was evidence
of heterogeneity between the trials of pramipexole (test for heterogeneity between trials, P=0.003; Analysis 2.2) for which there was
no obvious explanation. A comparison of the two MAOBIs also
found little evidence to suggest that there was a difference between

rasagiline and selegiline (test for heterogeneity between drugs, P=
0.02; Analysis 2.4). A greater reduction in levodopa dose was observed with selegiline (-257.4 mg/day, CI -454.80 to -60.00; P=
0.01; Analysis 2.4) than with rasagiline (-27.94 mg/day, -42.05
to -13.84; P=0.0001), but the selegiline data was based on data
from just one trial (MAOBI (S): Norw/Fin), and the two trials
of rasagiline only allowed the levodopa dose to be adjusted in the
first 6 weeks of the trial (MAOBI (R): LARGO; MAOBI (R):
PRESTO). In contrast, differences were again observed between
tolcapone and entacapone, with greater reductions in levodopa
dose seen with tolcapone (-116.47 mg/day, CI -140.62 to -92.32;
P<0.00001; Analysis 2.3) compared with entacapone (-41.62 mg/
day, CI -51.35 to -31.89; P<0.00001) (test for heterogeneity between drugs, P<0.00001). However, for both COMTIs there was
significant heterogeneity between trials (test for heterogeneity between trials, entacapone P=0.001, tolcapone P=0.002), which was
not explained by drug dose (all trials used 200mg of entacapone) or
treatment schedule (in all the COMTI studies changes in levodopa
dose were allowed, though in some studies the dose had to be kept
stable in the run-up to an assessment point) (See Characteristics
of included studies).

Clinician-Rated Disability Scales (Analysis 3.1 to Analysis 3.11)
Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy versus Placebo ( Analysis 3.1
to Analysis 3.3; Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 )
Data on the clinician-rated UPDRS activities of daily living
(ADL), motor and total (parts I-III or parts I-IV) scores were available from twenty-three (of the 44) trials for twenty-four comparisons, with eight (out of 20) trials of dopamine agonist, fourteen
(out of 18) trials of COMTI and two (out of 7) trials of MAOBI.
For the UPDRS ADL score, sixteen trials had data available (six trials of dopamine agonist and ten trials of COMTI) with 2655 participants included in the analysis (2655/7590; 35% of randomised
participants). Nineteen trials (for twenty comparisons) provided
data on the UPDRS motor score (seven trials of dopamine agonist, twelve trials of COMTI and one trial of MAOBI) with 3682
participants included (3682/7590; 49% of all randomised participants). Finally, UPDRS total score data were available from ten
trials (three trials of dopamine agonist reporting total parts I-IV,
six trials of COMTI reporting total parts I-III and one trial of
MAOBI reporting total parts I-IV) and included 1513 participants (1513/7590; 20% of all randomised participants).

and a 3.26 point (CI -4.52 to -2.00; P<0.00001; Analysis 3.3;
Figure 5) improvement in the UPDRS total score. For all three
UPDRS scores there was significant heterogeneity between trials
(P<=0.008) and between the three drug classes (P<=0.0008).
Interclass Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy ( Analysis 3.1 to
Analysis 3.3; Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 )
Indirect comparisons of the three adjuvant drug classes suggest
that improvements in all the UPDRS scores were greater with
dopamine agonists compared with COMTI and MAOBI (though
there were only two trials of MAOBI that reported UPDRS data
(MAOBI (R): Isra/Hun; MAOBI (R): LARGO). For the UPDRS
ADL score, there was a two point improvement with dopamine
agonist (-2.05 points, CI -2.58 to -1.51; P<0.00001; Analysis
3.1; Figure 3) compared to nearly a one point improvement with
COMTI (-0.91 points, CI -1.30 to -0.52; P<0.00001) (test for heterogeneity between drug classes, P=0.0008). Similarly, for the UPDRS motor score, a larger improvement was seen with dopamine
agonists, with a five point improvement (-4.86 points, CI -5.90
to -3.82; P<0.00001; Analysis 3.2; Figure 4) compared with a two
point improvement with COMTI (-2.02 points, CI -2.68 to -

1.37; P<0.00001) and a three point improvement with MAOBI
(-2.90 points, CI -4.29 to -1.51; P<0.0001) (test for heterogeneity between drug classes, P<0.0001). For the UPDRS total
score, dopamine agonists improved the score by ten points (-10.01
points, CI -12.76 to -7.26; P<0.00001; Analysis 3.3; Figure 5)
compared to improvements of one and half points with COMTI
(-1.46 points, CI -2.89 to -0.04; P=0.04) and two points with
MAOBI (-2.20 points, CI -16.56 to 12.16; p=0.76) (test for heterogeneity between drug classes, P<0.00001).
Intraclass Comparison of Drugs used as Adjuvant Therapy (
Analysis 3.4 to Analysis 3.11 )
Comparisons of the different drugs used as adjuvant therapy was
limited to trials of dopamine agonist and COMTI (as there were
only two trials of MAOBI, both of rasagiline). Indirect comparisons of dopamine agonists was limited to the agonists cabergoline, pramipexole and ropinirole for the UPDRS ADL and motor scores - UPDRS total data were only available for pramipexole. The agonist pramipexole appeared to produce larger improvements for both the UPDRS ADL (-2.07 points, CI -2.63 to 1.51; P<0.00001; Analysis 3.4) and UPDRS motor (-6.31 points,
CI -7.69 to -4.93; P<0.00001; Analysis 3.6) scores compared to
ropinirole (UPDRS motor: -4.80 points, CI -7.32 to -2.28; P=
0.0002) and cabergoline (UPDRS ADL: -1.78 points, CI -3.72 to
0.17; P=0.07; UPDRS motor: -1.74 points, CI -3.78 to 0.30; P=

0.09). Though these differences between agonist drugs was only
significant for the UPDRS motor score (test for heterogeneity between drugs, P=0.001). For COMTI (the drug class for which
the most data were available for analysis), there were no significant differences between entacapone and tolcapone for any of the
three UPDRS scores - UPDRS ADL (entacapone -1.16 points,
CI -1.68 to -0.64; P<0.0001 versus tolcapone -0.58 points, CI 1.18 to 0.02; P=0.06; test for heterogeneity between drugs, P=
0.15; Analysis 3.5); UPDRS motor (entacapone -2.14 points, CI
-2.92 to -1.36; P<0.00001 versus tolcapone -1.73 points, CI 2.96 to -0.51; P=0.006; test for heterogeneity between drugs, P=
0.59; Analysis 3.7); and UPDRS total (entacapone -1.88 points,
CI -3.94 to 0.18; P=0.07 versus tolcapone -1.08 points, CI -3.05
to 0.89; P=0.28; test for heterogeneity between drugs, P=0.58;
Analysis 3.10).
Dyskinesia and Dystonia (Analysis 4.1 to Analysis 4.5)

Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy versus Placebo ( Analysis 4.1
to Analysis 4.2; Figure 6 )
Dyskinesia and dystonia were reported within the papers as adverse events without further definition. Data on dyskinesia were
available from thirty-two (of the 44) trials for thirty-three comparisons, with fourteen (of the 20) trials of dopamine agonist, sixteen
(of the 18) trials of COMTI and three (of the 7) trials of MAOBI.
Dystonia was also reported in just five of these thirty-two trials
(two trials of dopamine agonist and three trials of COMTI). The
analysis of the incidence of dyskinesia included 6476 participants,
which represented 85% of the 7590 randomised participants included in this meta-analysis. Compared to placebo, the incidence
of dyskinesia (odds ratio (OR) 2.50, CI 2.21 to 2.84; P<0.00001;
Analysis 4.1; Figure 6), but not dystonia (OR 0.77, CI 0.48 to
1.23; P=0.28; Analysis 4.2), was increased with adjuvant therapy.

Interclass Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy ( Analysis 4.1 to
Analysis 4.2; Figure 6 )
Indirect comparisons of the three add-on drug classes suggest that
there may be differences across the classes in the incidence of dyskinesia (test for heterogeneity between drug classes, P=0.009), but
not dystonia (P=0.69). For dyskinesia, there was no difference
between MAOBI and placebo (OR 0.94, CI 0.49 to 1.80; P=
0.86), but for both dopamine agonist (OR 2.70, CI 2.26 to 3.22;
P<0.00001) and COMTI (OR 2.50, CI 2.07 to 3.01; P<0.00001),
the incidence of dyskinesia was significantly increased with adjuvant therapy (Analysis 4.1; Figure 6).
Intraclass Comparison of Drugs used as Adjuvant Therapy (
Analysis 4.3 to Analysis 4.5 )
Data on the incidence of dystonia was limited (5 trials reporting
just 85 cases of dystonia in 721 participants), so comparisons of
the individual drugs were performed only for dyskinesia for which
more data were available (1493 cases of dyskinesia in 6476 participants). Comparisons of the different dopamine agonist and
COMTI drugs used suggested that there were some differences
between the drugs and the risk of dyskinesia (test for heterogeneity
between dopamine agonists, P=0.002; COMTI, P=0.01; MAOBI,
P=0.24). For dopamine agonists, the incidence of dyskinesia was
greatest with pergolide (OR 4.64, CI 3.09 to 6.97; P<0.00001;
Analysis 4.3), though this was based on data from just one trial
(DA (Pe): N America), followed by ropinirole (OR 3.21, CI 1.98
to 5.21; P<0.00001), pramipexole (OR 2.63, CI 2.01 to 3.42;
P<0.00001), bromocriptine (OR 2.52, CI 1.42 to 4.48; P=0.002)
and cabergoline (OR 1.44, CI 0.96 to 2.16; P=0.08). Dyskinesia

was also increased with COMTI, with again a significant difference between the two drugs used, entacapone (OR 2.16, CI 1.73
to 2.70; P<0.00001; Analysis 4.4) and tolcapone (OR 3.66, CI
2.55 to 5.25; P<0.00001) (test for heterogeneity between drugs,
P=0.01).
Adverse Events (Analysis 5.1 to Analysis 5.40)
Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy versus Placebo ( Analysis 5.1,
Analysis 5.5 to Analysis 5.40; Figure 7 )
The incidence of any side-effect was increased with adjuvant therapy (OR 1.67, CI 1.46 to 1.92; P<0.00001; Analysis 5.1; Figure
7), with some evidence of a difference between the drug classes
(test for heterogeneity between drug classes, P=0.07), but not between the individual trials (test for heterogeneity between trials, P=
0.41). Analysis of individual side-effects showed that constipation
(OR 3.19, CI 2.17 to 4.68; P<0.00001; Analysis 5.5), dizziness
(OR 1.57, CI 1.30 to 1.90; P<0.00001; Analysis 5.6), dry mouth
(OR 2.33, CI 1.22 to 4.47; P=0.01; Analysis 5.7), hallucinations
(OR 2.16, CI 1.70 to 2.74; P<0.00001; Analysis 5.8), hypotension
(OR 1.47, CI 1.18 to 1.83; P=0.0007; Analysis 5.9), insomnia
(OR 1.38, CI 1.09 to 1.74; P=0.007; Analysis 5.10), nausea (OR
1.78, CI 1.53 to 2.07; P<0.00001; Analysis 5.11), somnolence
(OR 1.87, CI 1.40 to 2.51; P<0.0001; Analysis 5.12) and vomiting (OR 2.56, CI 1.67 to 3.93; P<0.0001; Analysis 5.13) were all
increased with adjuvant therapy. Urine discolouration (OR 6.42,
CI 4.63 to 8.90; P<0.00001; Analysis 5.40) was also increased
with adjuvant therapy, but this side-effect was only reported in
trials of COMTI.

Interclass Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy ( Analysis 5.1,
Analysis 5.5 to Analysis 5.40; Figure 7)
There was little evidence of a difference across the drug classes
with regards to the incidence of side-effects (test for heterogeneity between drug classes, P=0.07), with slightly more side-effects
seen with both dopamine agonist (OR 1.52, CI 1.22 to 1.90; P=
0.0002) and COMTI (OR 2.00, CI 1.62 to 2.47; P<0.00001)
than with MAOBI (OR 1.32, CI 0.95 to 1.84, P=0.1) (Analysis
5.1; Figure 7). The only individual side-effect for which there was
evidence of a difference between the drug classes was for diarrhoea
(test for heterogeneity between drug classes, P=0.006; Analysis
5.23). Diarrhoea was significantly more frequent with COMTI
(OR 2.34, CI 1.67 to 3.28; P<0.00001), but not with dopamine
agonist (OR 0.84, CI 0.27 to 2.63; P=0.77) or MAOBI (OR 0.39,
CI 0.12 to 1.29; P=0.12).
Intraclass Comparison of Drugs used as Adjuvant Therapy (
Analysis 5.2 to Analysis 5.4 )
Although side-effects were increased with all types of adjuvant
therapy, there was no evidence of any differences between the different drugs used. More side-effects were seen with the dopamine
agonists cabergoline (OR 2.08, CI 1.01 to 4.29; P=0.05; Analysis
5.2) and pramipexole (OR 1.67, CI 1.16 to 2.39; P=0.005) than
with ropinirole (OR 1.44, CI 0.99 to 2.09; P=0.05) or bromocriptine (OR 1.25, CI 0.77 to 2.03; P=0.36), but these differences
between the drugs were not statistically significant (test for heterogeneity between drugs, P=0.64). This was similar for COMTI
(entacapone OR 1.85, CI 1.47 to 2.33; P<0.00001 versus tolcapone OR 2.89, CI 1.74 to 4.79; P<0.0001; test for heterogeneity between drugs, P=0.12; Analysis 5.3) and MAOBI (rasagiline
OR 1.22, CI 0.84 to 1.79; P=0.3 versus selegiline OR 1.87, CI
0.48 to 7.23; P=0.36 versus sublingual selegiline OR 1.64, CI
0.75 to 3.57; P=0.21; test for heterogeneity between drugs, P=0.7;
Analysis 5.4).
Mortality (Analysis 6.1 to Analysis 6.4)
Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy versus Placebo ( Analysis 6.1
)
Most trials investigated only short-term efficacy, so data on mortality were available from just twelve of the 44 trials (with six of

these trials reporting that there were no deaths during the trial):
eight (out of 20) trials of dopamine agonist, two (out of 18) trials
of COMTI and two (out of 7) trials of MAOBI. The analysis of
mortality included 1845 participants, which represented 24% of
the 7590 randomised participants included in this meta-analysis.
The number of deaths reported in the twelve trials was small (n=
16), with the risk of mortality lower with adjuvant therapy (OR
0.32, CI 0.12 to 0.89; P=0.03; Analysis 6.1).
Interclass Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy ( Analysis 6.1 )
Mortality was reduced with all three add-on drug classes, and there
was no evidence of a difference between the classes (dopamine
agonist OR 0.35, CI 0.09 to 1.41; P=0.14; COMTI OR 0.33, CI
0.07 to 1.62, P=0.17; and MAOBI OR 0.14, CI 0.00 to 6.82; P=
0.32; test for heterogeneity between drug classes, P=0.9; Analysis
6.1).
Intraclass Comparison of Drugs used as Adjuvant Therapy (
Analysis 6.2 to Analysis 6.4 )
There was also no evidence that mortality differed depending on
the adjuvant therapy drug being used, though this analysis is based
on very small numbers (test for heterogeneity between agonists, P=
0.82 - the only drug class with data available for >2 drugs; Analysis
6.2).
Patient Withdrawal (Analysis 7.1 to Analysis 7.12)
Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy versus Placebo ( Analysis 7.1
to Analysis 7.3; Figure 8, Figure 9 and Figure 10 )
Data on patient withdrawal from treatment or from the trial were
available from most trials (32/44 trials), and the analyses included
6176 participants (81% of the 7590 randomised participants).
Overall patient withdrawal from the trials was less frequent with
adjuvant therapy (OR 0.71, CI 0.62 to 0.81; P<0.00001; Analysis
7.1; Figure 8), though there was evidence of heterogeneity between
trials (P<0.00001) and between the three drug classes (P<0.0001).
Investigation into the reasons for patient withdrawal suggested that
adjuvant therapy reduced the likelihood of a participant withdrawing due to lack of efficacy (OR 0.19, CI 0.13 to 0.28; P<0.00001;
Analysis 7.3; Figure 10), but increased the risk of withdrawal due
to adverse events (OR 1.20, CI 1.00 to 1.43; P=0.05; Analysis 7.2;
Figure 9).

Figure 10. Patient Withdrawal due to Lack of Efficacy (Adjuvant Therapy versus Placebo).

Interclass Comparison of Adjuvant Therapy ( Analysis 7.1 to
Analysis 7.3; Figure 8, Figure 9 and Figure 10 )
Although overall patient withdrawal was decreased with adjuvant
therapy, there was significant heterogeneity between the three drug
classes, suggesting that there may be differences between the types
of adjuvant therapy used (test for heterogeneity between drug
classes, P<0.0001). Patient withdrawal was less likely with either a
dopamine agonist (OR 0.56, CI 0.46 to 0.66; P<0.00001; Analysis
7.1; Figure 8) or MAOBI (OR 0.74, CI 0.50 to 1.11; P=0.15),
though for MAOBI this was not statistically significant. In contrast, patient withdrawal was slightly increased with COMTI (OR

1.06, CI 0.84 to 1.34; P=0.62), though the confidence interval is
compatible with a 16% reduction or a 34% increase in the risk
of patient withdrawal. For both patient drop-out due to adverse
events and patient drop-out due to lack of efficacy, there was no
evidence of a difference between the different drug classes (test for
heterogeneity between drug classes, P>=0.05). Patient withdrawal
due to adverse events were significantly increased with COMTI
(OR 1.46, CI 1.13 to 1.90; P=0.004; Analysis 7.2; Figure 9), but
not with dopamine agonist (OR 1.05, CI 0.82 to 1.35; P=0.69)
or MAOBI (OR 0.62, CI 0.27 to 1.41; P=0.25) (test for heterogeneity between drug classes, P=0.05). However, the reverse was

observed for patient withdrawal due to a lack of efficacy, which
were significantly reduced with dopamine agonist (OR 0.18, CI
0.12 to 0.28; P<0.00001; Analysis 7.3; Figure 10) and COMTI
(OR 0.18, CI 0.06 to 0.56; P=0.003). The MAOBI data included
only one patient withdrawal for lack of efficacy in two trials, and
did not differ significantly from the other drug classes (test for
heterogeneity between drug classes, P=0.33).
Intraclass Comparison of Drugs used as Adjuvant Therapy (
Analysis 7.4 to Analysis 7.12 )
Indirect comparisons of the drugs within each drug class found no
strong evidence to suggest there were differences in overall patient
withdrawal (P>=0.02; Analysis 7.4 to Analysis 7.6), patient withdrawal due to adverse events (P>0.2; Analysis 7.7 to Analysis 7.9)
or patient withdrawal due to lack of efficacy (P>0.6; Analysis 7.10
to Analysis 7.12). For dopamine agonists, the smallest number of
patient withdrawals was observed with pramipexole (OR 0.43, CI
0.33 to 0.55; P<0.00001; Analysis 7.4) and ropinirole (OR 0.53,
CI 0.37 to 0.76; P=0.0006), but there was only weak evidence of
a difference between the agonists (test for heterogeneity between
drugs, P=0.02). Comparisons of the two COMTIs, showed that
overall patient withdrawal was increased with entacapone (OR
1.08, CI 0.85 to 1.36; P=0.54; Analysis 7.5), but decreased with
tolcapone (OR 0.77, CI 0.26 to 2.26; P=0.63), but this difference
between the two drugs was not significant (test for heterogeneity between drugs, P=0.55). Similarly, for MAOBI, where patient
withdrawal was reduced with both rasagiline (OR 0.73, CI 0.47
to 1.12; P=0.15) and selegiline (OR 0.13, CI 0.02 to 0.93; P=
0.04), but increased with sublingual selegiline (OR 2.64, CI 0.58
to 12.01), the differences across the three MAOBI drugs was not
significant (test for heterogeneity between drugs, P=0.06).
Patient withdrawal due to adverse events were increased for the
dopamine agonists cabergoline (OR 1.24, CI 0.46 to 3.33; P=
0.67; Analysis 7.7) and pergolide (OR 2.25, CI 1.02 to 5.00;
P=0.05), similar for ropinirole (OR 1.00, CI 0.58 to 1.70; P=
0.99) and decreased for bromocriptine (OR 0.93, CI 0.56 to 1.53;
P=0.77) and pramipexole (OR 0.79, CI 0.55 to 1.14; P=0.21),
but there was no evidence of a difference between the agonists
(test for heterogeneity between drugs, P=0.22). Increases in patient
withdrawal due to adverse events were seen for both entacapone
(OR 1.45, CI 1.09 to 1.94; P=0.01; Analysis 7.8) and tolcapone
(OR 1.50, CI 0.85 to 2.65; P=0.16), with no difference between
the two COMTIs (test for heterogeneity between drugs, P=0.92).
Similarly, for MAOBI, where although patient withdrawal due to
adverse events were lower with rasagiline (OR 0.62, CI 0.24 to
1.60; P=0.33; Analysis 7.9) and selegiline (OR 0.13, CI 0.01 to
2.11; P=0.15), but higher with sublingual selegiline (OR 1.44, CI
0.17 to 11.86; P=0.74), there was no evidence that this differed
across the drugs (test for heterogeneity, P=0.40).
Patient withdrawal due to lack of efficacy was decreased for all
dopamine agonists (Analysis 7.10) and COMTIs (Analysis 7.11),
and there was no evidence that this patient withdrawal rate differed
across the different drugs (test for heterogeneity between drugs,

dopamine agonists P=0.61, COMTI P=0.81).
Quality of Life
Only three studies included a patient-rated quality of life assessment (COMTI (E): ComQol; COMTI (E): INT-02; DA (R):
EASE-PD). Two trials reported data on the eight domains of the
PDQ-39 - one trial of ropinirole (DA (R): EASE-PD) and one
trial of entacapone (COMTI (E): ComQol). The other trial (also
of entacapone) reported data using the mental and physical scores
of the SF-36 (COMTI (E): INT-02). No significant differences
in patient quality of life were observed between treatments in the
two trials of entacapone (COMTI (E): ComQol; COMTI (E):
INT-02). However, in the trial of ropinirole, there were significant
differences (in favour of ropinirole) in the mobility (difference: 6.8 points, CI -10.07 to -3.53; p<0.0001), activities of daily living (difference: -6.5 points, CI -9.71 to -3.25; p<0.0001), emotional well-being (difference: -3.7 points, CI -6.68 to -0.82; p=
0.01), stigma (difference: -4.5 points, CI -8.06 to -0.87; p=0.02)
and communication (difference: -3.7 points, CI -6.88 to -0.61;
p=0.02) domains of the PDQ-39 (DA (R): EASE-PD).
Health Economics
No studies reported data on health economic outcomes.

DISCUSSION
Summary of main results
This is the first reported ’umbrella’ meta-analysis to compare the
three drug classes used as adjuvant therapy for patients with later
PD who have developed motor complications (on levodopa therapy). It also reports the comparison of the different drugs used
within the adjuvant therapy drugs classes, and thus provides a comprehensive assessment of adjuvant therapy. Previous Cochrane reviews have investigated individual drugs within the three classes of
adjuvant therapy separately, making it difficult to compare the different add-on therapy regimens or the different drugs used as adjuvant therapy (Clarke 1999a; Clarke 1999b; Clarke 2000; Clarke
2001a; Clarke 2001b; Deane 2004; van Hilten 1998). This metaanalysis includes all oral drugs (excluding patches and pumps)
commonly used as adjuvant therapy (on a background of levodopa) for the treatment of later PD, and includes a more comprehensive range of outcomes than previous reviews, and thus provides the most reliable summary available of the current published
evidence.
Adjuvant Therapy versus Placebo
This review confirms reports from individual studies that adjuvant
therapy with a dopamine agonist, COMTI or MAOBI can reduce
patients’ off-time, reduce the required levodopa dose and improve
UPDRS scores in those patients with PD who have developed
motor complications on levodopa therapy. However, this is at the
expense of increased dyskinesia and numerous other side-effects
including constipation, dizziness, hallucinations, hypotension, in-

somnia, nausea, somnolence and vomiting. It is unclear from the
publications how severe or prolonged these side-effects were (most
studies were of short duration), although there was a trend towards
increased patient withdrawal due to adverse events in patients on
adjuvant therapy. However, patient withdrawal from treatment or
trial for any reason was less in those on adjuvant therapy indicating
that the balance of efficacy versus side-effects favoured adjuvant
therapy.
Interclass Comparisons of Adjuvant Therapy
Whilst it is clear that add-on therapy is beneficial in the treatment
of later PD, it is less clear which class of add-on drug therapy, if any,
is more efficacious. Clinicians and patients are obviously interested
in whether one add-on drug class may be more effective than another, as such information may help to establish an order in which
to use these drugs. Since the different drug classes target different
pharmacodynamic mechanisms, the trials included in this metaanalysis were divided according to drug class (dopamine agonist,
COMTI or MAOBI), and these classes were compared to investigate whether the treatment effect differed across the different
adjuvant therapy drug classes. These indirect comparisons should
however be interpreted cautiously, as differences in the trial populations studied, protocol specified dose modification schedules
and the outcome measures assessed can introduce spurious differences between drug classes. In this meta-analysis, there was only
one trial that included a randomisation between drugs from different classes (MAOBI and COMTI), but the study was not powered to compare the two active drugs (rasagiline and entacapone)
(COMTI (E): LARGO). Thus, indirect comparisons such as those
reported here are useful for generating hypotheses, but these hypotheses need to be tested in large randomised head-to-head trials.
To date, there are only three small randomised trials in adjuvant
PD therapy with direct class to class (COMTI versus DA) comparisons (CAMP Study Group 2007; Tolcapone/Pergolide Study
Group 2001; Tolcapone Study Group 1999).
As expected there was considerable heterogeneity between the different adjuvant therapy drugs, whether examined by individual
trial or when considering each class as a whole. In terms of the
efficacy outcome measures (off-time, levodopa dose and UPDRS
scores), the heterogeneity observed between the trials was probably due to real differences in efficacy between the three add-on
drug classes, as there were significantly greater reductions in both
off-time and levodopa dose, and greater improvements in UPDRS
scores with dopamine agonists than with COMTI and MAOBI.
For all cause withdrawal, the heterogeneity between trials was again
probably due to differences between the adjuvant therapy drug
classes, with the risk of patient withdrawal being significantly reduced with dopamine agonist therapy (compared with placebo),
but not with MAOBI or COMTI. These benefits for dopamine
agonists must however, be balanced against an increased risk of
dyskinesia and other side-effects. There was a greater incidence of
dyskinesia with dopamine agonists and COMTIs, but no increase
with MAOBIs (when compared with placebo). The risk of side-

effects was increased for all three add-on drug classes, with little
evidence that the risk of side-effects differed between the three
adjuvant therapy drug classes.
These indirect comparisons of placebo-controlled trials using tests
of heterogeneity to compare the three adjuvant therapy drug classes
indicates that dopamine agonist therapy may be more effective
than COMTI and MAOBI therapy. In terms of safety, dopamine
agonists and COMTIs have a similar prevalence of side-effects,
though more than MAOBIs. Thus, this meta-analysis suggests that
the greater efficacy and reduced likelihood of patient withdrawal
with dopamine agonist therapy possibly outweighs the disadvantage of increased side-effects.
Intraclass Comparisons within the Adjuvant Therapy Drug
Classes
In this review, we also compared the efficacy and safety of the individual drugs used within the different add-on drug classes. There
were generally insufficient data to draw any reliable conclusions
about the relative merits of for example, selegiline versus rasagiline, and between the different dopamine agonists. Only for the
two COMTIs entacapone and tolcapone was there evidence of a
possible difference in the efficacy of these drugs. Significant heterogeneity was found between entacapone and tolcapone for offtime reduction and levodopa dose reduction, which seems most
likely to be explained by greater efficacy of tolcapone compared
with entacapone. However, tolcapone has been associated with
several cases of fatal hepatic toxicity. Consequently, in Europe it
is licensed for use only after entacapone has been tried and failed,
and with mandatory long-term liver function tests. This makes
tolcapone therapy impractical for some patients.

Quality of the evidence
The majority of the trials included in this review were designed by
the pharmaceutical industry. Most had narrow inclusion criteria,
with patients being relatively young (early 60s) and predominantly
white compared to typical clinical populations. It is not possible to
examine differences in efficacy or side-effects by age in a published
data meta-analysis. Therefore, it is possible, that the findings of this
meta-analysis may be less applicable to, for example, older patients
with PD, who form the majority of PD patients. It is certainly
conceivable that older patients may not tolerate adjuvant therapy
as well as the generally younger patients involved in these trials.
Toxicity by age may well be better studied in a carefully conducted,
and adequately large, individual trial rather than in meta-analyses.
Another shortcoming of this meta-analysis is that the majority of
the trials included in this review were of six months or less in
duration. Only eight trials followed-up patients for longer than
six months, the longest being just two years, meaning that there
are inadequate data on the comparative efficacy and tolerability
of these drugs beyond six months. In such a long-term disease
as PD, it would obviously be valuable to know whether the drug
effects persist for a much longer period. Further, only three studies

included a patient-rated quality of life assessment (PDQ-39 in
two, SF-36 in one) (COMTI (E): ComQol; COMTI (E): INT02; DA (R): EASE-PD) and no studies reported data on health
economic outcomes. In the current cost-conscious health climate,
such information on both clinical and cost-effectiveness is clearly
important.
In summary, adjuvant therapy using dopamine agonists, COMTI
or MAOBI therapy on a background of levodopa is clearly effective in the management of later PD. This review suggests
that dopamine agonists may be more effective than COMTI and
MAOBI therapy. However, these comparisons are based on inference from indirect comparisons rather than direct head-to-head
comparisons - surprisingly few of which have been undertaken so uncertainty remains as to which class of drug is really the most
clinically and cost-effective in the treatment of PD patients experiencing motor complications. To clarify the long-term balance of
benefits and risks of adjuvant therapy, further large well-designed
randomised controlled trials directly comparing the differential
impact of these drugs on patient-rated quality of life and costeffectiveness are needed.

be more effective than COMTI and MAOBI therapy, which have
similar efficacy, and that the overall incidence of side-effects may
be comparable between all three drug classes. Intraclass comparisons generally showed no differences between individual drugs
within the drug classes, other than tolcapone appearing more effective than entacapone.
Clinicians need to choose between different adjuvant agents for
individual patients. Dopamine agonists appear more effective, but
may have a greater risk of the patient experiencing side-effects,
particularly in the elderly. The choice of a less effective drug class,
such as a COMTI or MAOBI, may reasonably be considered more
appropriate in view of the lower risk of side-effects (at least with
MAOBI).

Implications for research
The interclass and intraclass comparisons presented here are based
on indirect comparisons between results of different trials. A more
reliable comparison would be obtained in large randomised controlled clinical trials with direct head-to-head comparisons of these
drug classes. One such trial is ongoing in the UK (PD MED: http:
//www.pdmed.bham.ac.uk/), but others are needed.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Adjuvant treatment (on a background of levodopa) with either a
dopamine agonist, COMTI or MAOBI is effective in the management of patients with later Parkinson’s disease with motor complications. Indirect comparisons suggest that dopamine agonists may
