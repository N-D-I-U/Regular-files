MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an evolutionarily conserved class of small, regulatory non-coding RNAs that negatively
regulate protein coding gene and other non-coding transcripts expression. miRNAs have been established as
master regulators of cellular processes, and they play a vital role in tumor initiation, progression and metastasis.
Further, widespread deregulation of microRNAs have been reported in several cancers, with several microRNAs
playing oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles. Based on these, miRNAs have emerged as promising therapeutic
tools for cancer management. In this review, we have focused on the roles of miRNAs in tumorigenesis, the
miRNA-based therapeutic strategies currently being evaluated for use in cancer, and the advantages and current
challenges to their use in the clinic.

MiRNAs were originally identiﬁed as small non-coding RNAs that
control the timing of larval development in Caenorhabditis elegans
(Lee et al., 1993). MiRNAs are short, single stranded RNA molecules
that serve as master regulators of gene expression. They have been
widely implicated in pathogenesis of several human diseases, including
cancers (Berindan-Neagoe et al., 2014). Their abnormal levels in tumors
have important pathogenetic consequences: miRNAs overexpressed in
tumors contribute to oncogenesis by downregulating tumor suppressors. For example, miR17–92 cluster reduces tumorigenic levels of
E2F1 transcription factor in lymphomas (Ji et al., 2011), or miR-21 represses PTEN tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinomas (Meng
et al., 2007). On the other hand, miRNAs lost by malignant cells generally result in oncogene overexpression. For example, let-7 family represses RAS, HMGA2 and MYC in lung cancers (Wang et al., 2012), or
miR-15a and miR-16-1 downregulate BCL2 in chronic lymphocytic leukemias and cyclin D1 in prostate cancer and mantle cell lymphoma
(Calin and Croce, 2006a). However, several studies have shown that
miRNAs' roles in cancer are tissue and tumor speciﬁc: for example, in
breast cancer models, miR-200 family has been shown to work as an oncogene and enhance distant metastasis (Korpal et al., 2011), whereas in
ovarian, renal and lung tumors low expression of miR-200 family members signiﬁcantly associated with worse overall survival and also
inhibited angiogenesis (Pecot et al., 2013).
1. MiRNA Biogenesis and Mechanism of Action
miRNAs are short (19 to 24 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that are
processed from longer primary transcripts by successive endonuclease
enzymatic maturation steps (by Drosha in the nucleus and Dicer in
the cytoplasm) (Fig. 1). Functionally, miRNAs regulate gene expression
in a sequence speciﬁc manner. Following incorporation into the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex RISC (RNA induced silencing complex (comprising of proteins like Dicer and members of the Argonaute (AGO)
family), miRNAs bind messenger RNAs (mRNAs) primarily at their 3′

35

UTRs, via partial complementarity with their “seed” sequence (the
ﬁrst 2 to 8 nts at the miRNA's 5′ end, which deﬁnes miRNA families
and is important for proper target recognition). Consequently, mRNA
translation and/or stability are impaired (Filipowicz et al., 2008;
Valencia-Sanchez et al., 2006) with an ultimate reduction in protein expression levels (Bartel, 2004; Kim, 2005).
In addition to conventional 3′-UTR mechanism of action, we now
know that miRNAs can function in multiple ways. For example, miR363 and let-7 can activate mRNA expression of proteins they normally
repress during cell proliferation via recruitment of speciﬁc micro-RNPs
(like AGO2 and FXR1) to AU-rich elements inside mRNA 3′UTRs
(Vasudevan et al., 2007). It has also been shown that miRNAs are able
to target to 5′UTR and 3′UTR sequences alike. miR-10a can bind to the
5′UTR of ribosomal proteins following starvation and enhance their
translation (Vasudevan et al., 2007; Orom et al., 2008). In addition,
miRNA dependent mRNA repression can also occur via binding sites located inside mRNA coding sequences, as shown for miRNAs regulating
embryonic stem cell differentiation (Tay et al., 2008). Some studies
have suggested non-cytoplasmic functions of miRNAs in different subcellular compartments. miR-29b, for example, carries a distinct
hexanucleotide terminal motif that allows its nuclear translocation
and subsequent enrichment in the nucleus (Hwang et al., 2007).
miRNAs in the nucleus have been shown to act at the promoter level affecting transcription. For example, miR-551b-3p directly upregulates
STAT3 expression by binding to a complementary sequence on the
STAT3 promoter, and recruiting RNA polymerase II and the TWIST1
transcription factor to activate STAT3 transcription (ChaluvallyRaghavan et al., 2016). miRNAs have also been detected in
membrane-bound compartments, such as secreted vesicles (Zhang
et al., 2010) and mitochondria (Das et al., 2012). Interestingly, musclespeciﬁc miR-1 is able to stimulate mitochondrial translation of multiple
mitochondrial DNA-encoded transcripts, while repressing its nuclear
DNA-encoded targets in the cytoplasm (Zhang et al., 2014). Few
miRNAs act as decoys, by binding directly to RNA-binding proteins,

and inhibiting the interaction with their target RNA (Eiring et al., 2010).
Moreover, miRNAs can also regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level (Kim et al., 2008), by binding directly to the DNA regulatory
elements. Thus miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression is a
complex science and is still an evolving concept.

mutation (miR-155) (Valeri et al., 2010). The role of miRNAs in other
hallmarks of cancer have been discussed in detail in (Negrini et al.,
2009) (Fig. 2).

3. miRNAs and Tumor Microenvironment
2. Mechanisms of miRNA Deregulation in Cancer
The widespread differential expression of miRNA genes between
malignant and normal cells is a complex phenomenon, which requires
simultaneous combination of several factors, including miRNA expression control by oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, epigenetic mechanisms and preferential genomic location of miRNAs within cancerassociated regions (Lujambio et al., 2007; Calin et al., 2004). As a paradigm of this sophistication, the tumor suppressor miR-34a is positively
controlled by TP53 (Chang et al., 2007), repressed by MYC (Chang et al.,
2008), silenced by aberrant CpG methylation (Lodygin et al., 2008) and
is located at 1p36, a chromosomal region frequently lost in neuroblastomas (Wei et al., 2008). Accordingly, numerous genetic studies allowed
the identiﬁcation of miRNA abnormalities in human cancer by dissecting their transcriptional regulators (Chang et al., 2008; Calin and
Croce, 2006b). Cancer associated miRNAs have been located downstream of major oncogenic and tumor suppressive transcription factors:
for example, TP53 promotes the transcription of all the members of the
miR-34 family, while MYC can both positively and negatively regulate
transcription of different miRNAs (e.g. miR-17–92 cluster and let-7 family, respectively). Additionally, a miRNA hypermethylation proﬁle characteristic of human metastasis was identiﬁed (Lujambio et al., 2007). It
was identiﬁed that somatic mutations in DICER1 and DROSHA impaired
biogenesis of tumor suppressive miRNA, including let-7 family, in
Wilms tumor (Rakheja et al., 2014). Methylation of miR-9 family
genes (miR-9-1, miR-9-2 and miR-9-3) has been identiﬁed in several
metastatic cancer cell lines (Lujambio et al., 2008) miR-9 family genes
are simultaneously methylated in gastric cancer (Tsai et al., 2011).
Methylation of miR-9-1 is associated with lymph node metastasis in
CRC (Bandres et al., 2009), and methylation of miR-9-1 and miR-9-3 is
correlated with metastatic recurrence of renal cell carcinoma
(Hildebrandt et al., 2010). These are only initial steps toward the understanding of the causes of miRNA deregulation during metastases, and
newer mechanisms will continue to be identiﬁed as the ﬁeld evolves.
Deregulation of miRNA expression in cancer subsequently leads to
altered functionality of these miRNAs. Upregulated miRNAs often act
as oncogenes, as exempliﬁed by miR-21 or miR-155 overexpression
which causes acute B cell leukemia in transgenic mice models
(Medina et al., 2010; Costinean et al., 2006). Consequently, downregulated miRNAs act as tumor suppressor, such as miR-15a/16–1 cluster,
for which the knock-out mice develop chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(Klein et al., 2010). In certain cases, the same miRNA that acts like an oncogene in one type of cell and as a suppressor in another. This is primarily due to different targets and mechanisms of action (for example miR222 is overexpressed in liver cancers and targets PTEN suppressor,
while it is downregulated in erythroblastic leukemia where it targets
c-KIT oncogene). Below, we provide a few examples of miRNAs that affect the emerging hallmarks of cancer as described by Hanahan and
Weinberg (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; Hanahan and Weinberg,
2011): sustaining proliferative signaling (miR-21, let-7 family)
(Dalmay and Edwards, 2006); evading growth receptors (miR-17-92
cluster) (Dalmay and Edwards, 2006); resisting cell death (miR-15/16,
miR-34 cluster) (Dalmay and Edwards, 2006); enabling replicative immortality (miR-34a, miR-372/373 cluster) (Dalmay and Edwards,
2006); inducing angiogenesis (miR-210) (Dalmay and Edwards,
2006); Activating invasion and metastasis (miR-10b) (Nicoloso et al.,
2009); avoiding immune destruction (miR-520d) (Stern-Ginossar
et al., 2008); deregulating cellular genetics (miR-122, miR-210) (Esau
et al., 2006; Chan et al., 2009); tumor-promoting inﬂammation (miR146, miR-155) (Schetter et al., 2010); and genome instability and

While miRNAs have been well established to play an important role
in intracellular processes, more recent evidence also support an extracellular role of miRNAs that are produced by microenvironment cells.
As hormones, miRNAs are released by a donor cell as ‘free’ molecules
or in various forms of vesicles secreted by active mechanisms (Shah
and Calin, 2013). These miRNAs are then taken up by cells located in
other parts of the body, regulating the protein expression proﬁle in
these recipient cells. It was shown that miR-181c released from
cancer-derived extracellular vesicles triggered brain metastasis by inducing the breakdown of blood brain barrier via the downregulation
of its target gene PDPK1 (Tominaga et al., 2015).
A role of circulating miRNAs in transforming ﬁbroblasts, major constituents of the extracellular matrix and involved in several cellular
mechanisms including wound repair, into cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts
(CAFs) has been reported (Carstens et al., 2014). Low expression of miR31 and miR-214 and high expression of miR-155 have been found to be
involved in reprograming quiescent ﬁbroblasts to CAFs in ovarian cancers. miR-214 was found to directly target the CCL5 (C-C motif ligand
5) chemokine important for CAF function (Mitra et al., 2012). Furthermore, miR-31 was reported to be the most downregulated miRNA in
CAFs isolated from endometrial cancer when compared to normal endometrial ﬁbroblasts. miR-31 directly targets the homeobox gene SATB2,
which is signiﬁcantly elevated in CAFs and is responsible for chromatin
remodeling and regulation of gene expression (Aprelikova et al., 2010).
It was shown that endogenous miRNAs, miR-155 and miR-146a are
transferred between primary bone-marrow derived dendritic cells. Administration of miR-155 or miR-146a-containing exosomes modulates
the endogenous immune response to endotoxins in vivo (Alexander
et al., 2015). Essentially, these studies highlight that secreted miRNAs
represent a novel regulatory mechanism by which donor cells can inﬂuence the gene expression of recipient cells, and thus impact physiological and pathological processes.

4. miRNAs and Immune Response
Circulating miRNAs have been reported to modulate immune responses. For example, it was shown that antigen-dependent transfer
of miR-335 from T-cells to antigen-presenting cells is important during
immune synapse formation (Mittelbrunn et al., 2011). Recent studies
have demonstrated that miRNAs in placenta-derived exosomes from
trophoblasts function as immune regulators in fetal–maternal crosstalk
(Luo et al., 2009). miR-517a is secreted into maternal circulation where
it improves maternal acclimatization to pregnancy and promotes fetal
allograft survival.
Furthermore, miRNAs have been shown to be important in the development, differentiation and modulation of the immune cell repertoire, as well as of the innate and adaptive immune responses (Chou
et al., 2013; Tili et al., 2013). miRNAs have been identiﬁed to regulate
T cell response, maturation, differentiation and function, such as activation, proliferation and apoptosis (Liu et al., 2013). These include, for example, the oncogenic members of the miR-17–92 cluster involved in
apoptosis of CD4+ T cells (Molitoris et al., 2011), while miR-222 and
miR-339 promote resistance of cancer cells to cytotoxic T lymphocytes
(CTL) by downregulation of ICAM-1 (Ueda et al., 2009). In addition, it
was reported that p53 regulated PDL1 expression via miR-34 in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Administration of miR-34a mimics,
alone or in combination with radiotherapy, reduced PDL1 expression
in the tumor and antagonized T-cell exhaustion (Cortez et al., 2016).

5. Various Strategies to use miRNAs Therapeutics
Despite considerable advances in our understanding of the molecular carcinogenesis of human cancers and the extensive research on combined and targeted therapies, there is still a constant need for the
development of novel therapeutic tools. Additionally, treatment with
any individual therapy conﬁnes them to the ‘one-drug-one-target’ paradigm and renders them susceptible to resistance in due course. RNA
molecules are now at the center of molecular oncology, with applications for diagnosis and therapy starting to be proposed. The ability of
miRNAs to regulate important cellular processes by concurrently regulating multiple targets illustrates their potential as a viable therapeutic
tool. There are currently two strategies described for the treatment of
cancer using RNAi-based therapy.

inhibition’ strategy (Calin and Croce, 2009). For example, it was demonstrated the applicability of ‘sensor’ siRNAs, a universal platform for the
combination RNAi therapeutics, in targeting the complete RAF node
(KRAS + PIK3CA/B) to treat KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (Yuan
et al., 2014). Using in vitro and in vivo modes they showed that siRNAmediated inhibition of KRAS as well as RAF or PI3K combinations
could impair KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer in xenograft models.
These studies highlight the efﬁciency and applicability of RNAi-based
therapeutic strategies in management of cancers.
Current approaches for miRNA therapy involve either a) the restoration of tumor suppressive genes by inhibition of oncogenic miRNA using
‘anti-miRNAs’; or b) inhibition of oncogenic genes by treatment with
‘miRNA-mimics’ (Fig. 1, Table 1).
5.3. miRNA Inhibition Therapy

5.1. Sandwich RNAi Inhibition Strategy
One strategy involves using multiple agents to target one speciﬁc
molecular defect linked with cancer pathogenesis – a ‘sandwich RNAi
inhibition’ strategy (Calin and Croce, 2009). We exempliﬁed this strategy by targeting an important ovarian cancer oncogene, EphA2, using a
combination of EphA2-targeting siRNAs and miR-520d-3p (an EphA2targeting miRNA) mimics (Nishimura et al., 2013). Dual targeting of
EphA2 exhibited synergistic anti-tumor efﬁciency than either monotherapy alone, both in vitro and in vivo. Combined miRNA-siRNA therapy prominently decreased EphA2 protein levels, suppressed tumor
growth, and inhibited migration and invasion. Thus regimens using a
cocktail of RNAi-based therapeutics to target dominant oncogenes
might achieve better therapeutic outcomes in human cancers.
5.2. Multiplex RNAi Inhibition Strategy
In this strategy, multiple molecular defects accumulated in the multistep pathway of a speciﬁc cancer can be targeted – a ‘multiplex RNAi

Oncogenic miRNAs that are frequently overexpressed in human cancers and need to be inhibited to help restore the normal expression and
function of its target tumor suppressive genes. miRNA inhibitors are essentially complementary single stranded oligonucleotides that sequester the endogenous miRNA in an unrecognized conformation. As a
result, the mature miRNA cannot be processed by the RISC, and is thus
excluded from the RISC. These include antisense anti-miR oligonucleotides (AMOs), locked nucleic acid (LNA) anti-miRNAs, antagomirs,
miRNA sponges, miRNA masks and small molecule inhibitors of
miRNAs.
Anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs) are single-stranded, chemically modiﬁed anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs), that are 17 to 22 nt
in length and designed to be complementary to a selected miRNA
(Garzon et al., 2010). They work as competitive inhibitors of miRNAs
by annealing to the mature miRNA and inhibiting the interaction of
that miRNA with its target mRNAs. Thus targeted inhibition of a speciﬁc
miRNA and subsequent upregulation of its target mRNAs can be
achieved. Mechanistically, they produce ASO-miRNA duplex through

LNAs are bicyclic RNA analogues where the ribose is
locked in a C3’-endo conformation by the introduction of
a 2’-O,4′-C methylene bridge (Elmen et al., 2008)
Antagomirs Single-stranded 23 nt RNA molecules complementary to
the targeted miRNA that have been modiﬁed to increase
the stability of the RNA and protect it from degradation.
The modiﬁcations included a partial phosphorothioate
backbone in addition to 2′-O-methoxyethyl (Krutzfeldt
et al., 2005).

Watson-Crick binding, leading to RNAse-H-mediated cleavage of the
target miRNA gene. Important for the potential clinical use, AMOs harboring a complete 2′-O-methoxyethyl and phosphorothioate modiﬁcation have been demonstrated to silence in vivo miR-122 in mouse liver
(Hutvagner et al., 2004). In contrast, unmodiﬁed AMOs are unable to inhibit miRNA function in vitro.
The antagomirs are chemically modiﬁed and cholesterol-conjugated
single-stranded 23-nt RNA molecules complementary to the targeted
miRNAs. The modiﬁcations were introduced to increase the stability of
the RNA and protect it from degradation. When intravenously administered to mice, antagomir-122 induced a marked, speciﬁc, and persistent
(up to 23 days) reduction of endogenous miR-122 gene expression in
liver, lung, kidney, heart, intestine, fat, skin, bone marrow, muscle, ovaries and adrenals (Krutzfeldt et al., 2005). The same was true for
antagomir-16, targeting the ubiquitously expressed miR-16
(Krutzfeldt et al., 2005). Silencing of miRNAs by these new agents also
produced other positive physiologic effects, for example the decrease
in plasma cholesterol levels after antagomir-122 administration. One
clear advantage with respect to siRNA technology is that antagomirs
did not induce an immune response.
Another example of modiﬁed AMOs are the Locked Nucleic Acid
(LNA) anti-miRs, in which an extra methylene bridge connecting the
2′-O atom and the 4′-C atom ‘locks’ the ribose ring in a C3′-endo or
C2′-endo conformation (Vester and Wengel, 2004; Elmen et al., 2008).
LNA-modiﬁed oligonucleotides exhibit higher thermal stability and
high-afﬁnity Watson-Crick hybridization with their RNA target molecules, with improved mismatch discrimination. Furthermore, they display higher aqueous solubility and increased metabolic stability for
in vivo delivery. miR-21, shown to be strongly overexpressed in glioblastomas, was silenced in vitro by using LNA-modiﬁed antisense oligonucleotides leading to a signiﬁcant reduction in cell viability and
elevated intracellular levels of caspases (Griveau et al., 2013). In a recent
study (Gallo et al., 2016), the authors evaluated the pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic properties of LNA-anti-miR-221 in NOD.SCID
mice and Cynomolgus monkeys. They reported that LNA-anti-miR-221
have a short half-life, optimal tissue bioavailability minimal urine excretion in both mice and monkeys and was detectable in mice vital organs

and in xenografted tumors for up to 3 weeks after treatment. These
studies highlight the suitability of LNA-anti-miRNAs for clinical use.
‘miRNA sponges’ or ‘miRNA decoys’ contain multiple artiﬁcial
miRNA binding sites that compete with the endogenous miRNA targets
for miRNA binding (Ebert et al., 2007). Inhibition of miR-9, which is upregulated in breast cancer cells and directly targets CDH1, using a
‘miRNA sponge’ inhibited metastasis formation (Ma et al., 2010).
‘miRNA masks’ are novel gene-speciﬁc anti-miRNAs that can selectively
inhibit the interaction of the target miRNA with a speciﬁc mRNA. These
effectively mask the speciﬁc mRNA from the endogenous miRNA and
thus prevent its repression (Xiao et al., 2007).
5.4. miRNA Mimetic Agents
‘miRNA mimics’ are an effective alternative to restore the normal
function of tumor suppressive miRNAs by replacing or substituting the
lost miRNA using synthetic miRNA-like molecules. These are small,
chemically modiﬁed (2′-O′methoxy) RNA duplexes that can be loaded
into RISC and achieve the downstream inhibition of the target mRNAs.
Numerous studies have validated the efﬁciency of miRNA replacement
therapy in in vitro and in vivo models. For example, introduction of
miRNA mimics for miR-15a in prostate cancer cell lines induced marked
apoptosis and blocked proliferation (Bonci et al., 2008). Intranasal administration of let-7 in a K-ras mutant mouse effectively restrained
the growth of the tumors by repression of proliferation and cell cycle
pathways (Esquela-Kerscher et al., 2008; Trang et al., 2010). More recently, a new RNA polymerase II driven expression vector for miR-155
has been shown to effectively increase miR-155 expression levels
in vitro and in in vivo xenograft models (Chung et al., 2006). An
aptamer-miRNA conjugate of tumor suppressor let-7 g miRNA and the
GL21. T aptamer, was engineered and demonstrated target speciﬁc delivery of the conjugate (Esposito et al., 2014). let-7g:GL21. T conjugate
can successfully inhibit cell survival and migration in vitro and in vivo
in lung cancer model.
Thus administration of miRNA-mimetic agents in patients might be
a new avenue for clinical cancer management. Although all of these
strategies have been truly exciting, there are still challenges involved

M.Y. Shah et al. / EBioMedicine 12 (2016) 34–42

in the delivery of these agents. Several new delivery agents are currently
being explored to afford safe, effective and efﬁcient delivery of miRNAs.
One example is the chitosan based delivery system that was reported to
be quite versatile for delivery into multiple tumor and stromal compartments (Han et al., 2010), as well as for miRNAs (Gaur et al., 2015). However, we are still in the need of ﬁnding new alternative therapeutic
approaches to inhibit oncomiRs, and decrease their activity.
5.5. SMIRs — Small Molecules Inhibitors of miRNAs
Small molecule inhibitors of miRNAs (SMIRs) (Monroig et al., 2015)
are small molecules that primarily function by inhibiting miRNA biogenesis or by actively impeding miRNA-target interaction. The SMIRapproach is an appealing one, speciﬁcally because it is a way of taking
the “fast-track lane” in the drug-developing race, reducing time of production/approval and therefore the cost of it. Gumireddy et al.
(Gumireddy et al., 2008) reported a cellular screen for miRNApathway inhibitors and found the ﬁrst small-molecule inhibitor of
miRNA function. The mode of action of the small molecules is mainly
through the transcriptional regulation of miR-21 rather than inhibition
of target recognition by miR-21. It was reported that the small molecule
enoxacin, an antibacterial ﬂuoroquinolone, binds to the miRNA biosynthesis protein TAR RNA-binding protein 2 (TRBP) and enhances the production of tumor suppressor miRNAs (Melo et al., 2011). Conversely
two compounds, polylysine (PLL) and trypaﬂavine (TPF) were identiﬁed that suppressed miRNA-RISC activity and exhibited anti-tumor activity in vitro (Watashi et al., 2010). Thus, small molecule modulators
of miRNAs represent a unique strategy for restoring dysregulated
miRNAs in cancer.
5.6. Targeting miRNAs From Microvesicles and Exosomes
As miRNAs are often transferred between various types of cells within a tumor or between the tumor and the metastatic sites, one way to
perturb this mode of transport is to block extracellular miRNAs in
exosomes. It has been shown that the small molecule GW4869, an inhibitor of neutral sphingomyelinase that is also known to inhibit
miRNA and exosome secretion, can be effectively used to interrupt
miRNA-mediated aberrant cross-talk between cancer cells and surrounding immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (Fabbri
et al., 2012; Kosaka et al., 2010). MiR-21 and miR-29a can be released
by cancer cells within exosomes and are engulfed by macrophages in
the tumor microenvironment expressing TLRs. It has also been shown
in mice that extracellular let-7 can activate TLR7 and induce neurodegeneration through neuronal TLR7 (Lehmann et al., 2012). Intriguingly,
let-7b levels are higher in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) of patients with
Alzheimer's disease, indicating that miRNA-mediated activation of TLRs
may have implications beyond cancer.
The use of molecules that block the functions of speciﬁc miRNAs
(such as LNA anti-miR-21 and LNA anti-miR-29a) in tumor cells could
reduce miRNA levels in exosomes released by cancer cells and effectively decrease miRNA-mediated TLR activation (Fabbri et al., 2012). Likewise, it can be postulated that miR-21 or miR-29a could be mutated in
such a way that they retain the ability to bind to TLRs but fail to activate
them, thereby offsetting the cross talk between cancer-released miRNAs
and TLRs. Moreover, genetically engineered TLR decoy molecules could
be designed to bind and sequester miRNAs released by cancer cells in
the tumor microenvironment, without triggering TLR activated signaling transduction pathways.
An additional strategy targeting miRNA transport involves the use of
antibodies that recognize tumor speciﬁc antigens expressed by cancerreleased exosomes. The advantage of this approach could be that some
of the antigens most likely have reduced antigenic properties and permit the production of cancer-released exosomes without any obvious
stimulation of the immune system. Finally, we can envision a futuristic
therapeutic strategy where cells are stimulated to secrete oncogenic

39

miRNA-loaded nanovesicles and the cancer patient is subsequently
treated with dialysis, as a way to “wash-out” oncogenes from cancer
cells.
6. First Clinical Trials With miRNAs
MiRNAs represent promising therapeutic agents and several pharmaceutical companies already have miRNA therapeutics in their developmental pipelines. Current strategies for inhibitory-miRNA therapies
are based on antisense antimiRs, (LNA), LNA-antimiR constructs,
antagomirs, and miRNA sponges. Some of these have proven to be effective not only in vitro, but also in vivo. For instance, Regulus Therapeutics
is actively exploring the value of anti-miRs in the treatment of diseases
such as ﬁbrosis, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, atherosclerosis and
cancer. MIRagen Therapeutics is using chemically modiﬁed structures
of miRNA (including miR-15/195, miR-29, and others) in work that
has reached preclinical development in pathologies such as metabolic
and cardiovascular diseases. MRX34, a liposome-formulated mimic of
the tumor suppressor, miR-34, developed by Mirna Therapeutics, produced complete tumor regression in orthotopic mouse models of liver
cancer, with no observed immunostimulatory activity or toxicity to normal tissues. In a Phase I clinical trial with patients with advanced solid
tumors (N = 99), a standard dose escalation trial of MRX34 infused IV
on a biweekly or daily schedule were given. Phase 1 results, as reported
at ASCO 2016 meeting, showed that MRX34 has a manageable toxicity
proﬁle and strong evidence of activity in hepatocellular carcinoma,
renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Analysis of RNA from WBCs
showed dose-dependent repression of miR-34a target oncogenes, including FOXP1, BCL2, HDAC1, and CTNNB1 in these patients. Unfortunately, recently Mirna Therapeutics halted the Phase I clinical trial due
to multiple immune-related severe adverse events (SAE) (http://
www.businesswire.com). Therefore, strategies as the ones presented
above should be used to reduce the dosages of miR mimetics/antimiRs and consequently their potential adverse reactions.
Miravirsen (SPC3649) is an LNA against miR-122 developed by
Santaris Pharma A/S for the treatment of hepatitis C (HCV), a viral infection known to predispose patients to hepatocellular carcinoma. A phase
I clinical trial demonstrated that antagomiR-122 has dose-dependent
pharmacology and is well tolerated. When investigated in a phase II
clinical trial, Miravirsen was found to be well tolerated in patients
with HCV, with mild side effects including light coryza, diarrhea, and
headache. Importantly, the administration of Miravirsen in patients
with chronic HCV-1 displayed extended dose-dependent diminutions
in HCV RNA levels without any manifestation of viral resistance
(Janssen et al., 2013). However, it was found that long term treatment
with Miravirsen in vitro induces resistance due to mutations in the
viral genome (Ottosen S et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016).
miR-16 mimics are also currently under Phase I clinical trials for patients with Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) and Advanced
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) that have failed standard therapy.
These miR-16 mimics were delivered intravenously, using EnGeneIC
Delivery Vehicle (EDV)-Packaging, and were conjugated with an
EGFR-targeting antibody. Preliminary data presented by Van Zandwijk
et al. (Van Zandwijk et al., 2015) show manageable safety proﬁle in 5
patients. In addition, MIRagen Therapeutics recently announced phase
I clinical trials for two candidate miRNA-based candidates: MRG-201,
a synthetic microRNA mimic to microRNA-29b, will be tested for patients with scleroderma, and MRG-106, a synthetic microRNA antagonist of microRNA-155, will be tested for patients with cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma of the mycosis fungoides (MF) sub-type. The estimated primary completion date for both the studies is late 2016.
7. Conclusion
microRNAs represent critical regulators of tumor initiation, progression, and dissemination. Extensive evidence suggests that inhibition of

40

M.Y. Shah et al. / EBioMedicine 12 (2016) 34–42

overexpressed oncogenic miRNAs or substitution of tumor suppressive
miRNAs could become a robust strategy for cancer therapy. The optimization of miRNA delivery systems, improvements in the stability of
miRNAs, and a detailed understanding of the off-target effects of
miRNA therapeutics are several challenges that need to be resolved for
successful translation of miRNA therapeutics from bench to bedside.
8. Outstanding Questions
miRNA-based therapeutics hold great promise as highly speciﬁc,
targeted therapies for cancer treatment. However, to achieve superior
sensitivity and speciﬁcity, and accelerate their adoption in the clinic,
there still exists the need to improve their chemical designs, develop
better delivery options, show prolonged therapeutic efﬁciency, and
evaluate the long-term safety of these agents in vivo. Furthermore, it is
imperative to understand the underlying intricate network of interactions between miRNAs and the human genome, transcriptome and
proteome before their transition into clinical use. In addition, a full assessment of their toxicities need to be performed, and low-toxicity
strategies such as combining miRNAs and siRNAs at low doses, or
using miRNA therapy as an additive to established chemotherapy regimens, should be evaluated. Overall, miRNA-based therapy can potentially bring an exciting new facet to personalized medicine for cancer
treatment; however, a deeper and clearer understanding of its biology
is required.
