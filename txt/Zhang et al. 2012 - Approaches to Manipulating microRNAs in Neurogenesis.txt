Neurogenesis in the nervous system is regulated by both protein coding genes and
non-coding RNA molecules. microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding
RNAs and usually negatively regulate gene expression by binding to the 3 untranslated
region (3 UTR) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). miRNAs have been shown to
play an essential role in neurogenesis, regulating neuronal proliferation, differentiation,
maturation, and migration. An important strategy used to reveal miRNA function is the
manipulation of their expression levels and patterns in specific regions and cell types in
the nervous system. In this review we will systemically highlight established and new
approaches used to achieve gain-of-function and loss-of-function of miRNAs in vitro and
in vivo, and will also summarize miRNA delivery techniques. As the development of these
leading edge techniques come online, more exciting discoveries of the roles miRNAs play
in neural development and function will be uncovered.

The proper development of the nervous system relies on precisely programmed regulation
of gene expression. The discovery of the noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) has revealed a
new paradigm of gene expression control, and
the manipulation of miRNA expression levels and patterns in the nervous system has
demonstrated the critical role they play in
Neurogenesis. In this review, we will highlight
various leading edge approaches that have been
used to investigate miRNA function in neural
development.

miRNA DISCOVERY AND BIOGENESIS
miRNAs are endogenous, small non-coding,
single stranded RNA molecules of ∼22
nucleotide (nt) in length. Most miRNAs
act as repressors of target messenger RNAs
(mRNAs) by a posttranslational regulatory
mechanism. Since the first identification of

www.frontiersin.org

miRNA lin-4 in Caenorhabditis. elegans, the
database of published miRNA sequences has
rapidly expanded, with 1600 miRNA precursors
and 2042 mature miRNAs in humans, 855
precursors and 1281 mature miRNAs in mice,
238 precursors and 426 mature miRNAs in
Drosophila, and 223 precursors and 368 mature
miRNAs in C. elegans (The miRBase Sequence
Database Release 19, http://www.mirbase.org)
(Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2011).
In most cases, miRNAs are transcribed as
single-stranded primary miRNA (pri-miRNA)
from intragenic or intergenic genomic regions
by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (Lee et al., 2004;
Rodriguez et al., 2004). The pri-miRNAs are
further cleaved by the RNase III-type nuclease
Drosha and its co-factor DiGeorge Syndrome
Critical Region Gene 8 (DGCR8/Pasha) to produce ∼70 bp precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs)
(Lee et al., 2003; Denli et al., 2004; Gregory et al.,

microRNAs (miRNAs)
∼22 nucleotide endogenous small
non-coding RNAs that exist in many
organisms such as plants, invertebrates
and vertebrates. Mature miRNAs
regulate gene expression by binding to
the 3 untranslated region (3 UTR) of
target protein coding genes, and affect
stability of messenger RNAs (mRNAs)
and/or reduce protein translation.
Neurogenesis
A process of generating neurons
from neural stem cells and neural
progenitors. It involves tightly
controlled regulation of proliferation,
differentiation, migration and

Manipulating miRNAs in neurogenesis

2004). A different biogenesis pathway exists
for miRNAs that are transcribed from intronic
regions of protein-coding genes, termed
mirtrons that are processed by the spliceosome
and then by lariat debranchase activity to generate pre-miRNAs in various species (Berezikov
et al., 2007; Okamura et al., 2007; Ruby et al.,
2007). The hairpin shaped pre-miRNAs from
both the canonical and mirtron biogenesis
pathways are transported from nucleus to cytoplasm, and further cleaved by another RNase III
member Dicer into imperfect complementary
double stranded mature miRNAs of ∼18–25 bp
(Hammond et al., 2000; Grishok et al., 2001;
Hutvagner et al., 2001). In addition, a number of
alternative miRNA biogenesis pathways such as
Drosha/DGCR8 independent and Dicer dependent miRNA biogenesis pathways have been
reported (Yang and Lai, 2011). And the maturation of miR-451 has been shown to require argonaute 2 (Ago2) but not Dicer (Cheloufi et al.,
2010; Cifuentes et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2010).
For most miRNAs, one strand from the
mature miRNA duplex is loaded into the RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC) (Hutvagner
and Zamore, 2002; Chendrimada et al., 2005;
Bartel, 2009). The RISC, guided by miRNA,
binds to the 3 UTR of target mRNAs through
specific complementarity of the 2–7 nt at the
5 end of the miRNA, which is termed the seed
sequence (Lewis et al., 2003, 2005). Translation
of mRNAs targeted in this manner is suppressed
and the mRNAs may undergo degradation
(Bartel, 2009) (Figure 1A). The RISC-miRNA
pathway thus represents a novel and important
gene silencing mechanism that exists in many
organisms.

APPROACHES TO MANIPULATING miRNAs
IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
In the nervous system, the process of neurogenesis involves precise regulation of neuronal
proliferation, differentiation,
maturation,
and migration. Accumulating evidence has
highlighted the critical role that miRNAs play
in neurogenesis (Kosik and Krichevsky, 2005;
Kosik, 2006; Fineberg et al., 2009; Liu and Zhao,
2009; Lau and Hudson, 2010; Shi et al., 2010;
Bian and Sun, 2011; Cochella and Hobert,
2012; Luikart et al., 2012). We here summarize
approaches that have been used to manipulate
miRNA expression in order to investigate their
functions.
APPROACHES TO BLOCKING miRNA BIOGENESIS

miRNA biogenesis has been blocked in different regions or cell types in the nervous system

by tissue specific ablation of Dicer using various Cre lines such as the Emx1-Cre line in
the embryonic cortex and the CamKII-Cre line
in the postnatal brain and adult hippocampus
(Cuellar et al., 2008; Davis et al., 2008; De Pietri
Tonelli et al., 2008; Kawase-Koga et al., 2009;
Shin et al., 2009; Soukup et al., 2009; Andersson
et al., 2010; Budde et al., 2010; Huang et al.,
2010; Kawase-Koga et al., 2010; Konopka et al.,
2010; Zehir et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010b,c;
Zheng et al., 2010; Iida et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011;
Liu et al., 2011; Nowakowski et al., 2011; Tao
et al., 2011; Chen and Wichterle, 2012; Repetto
et al., 2012; Rosengauer et al., 2012). Mice
with tissue specific Dicer deletion show various
neural defects, suggesting an important role of
miRNAs in neural development and function.
Moreover, a mouse model with a microdeletion
syntenic to the human chromosome 22q11 deletion, which includes DGCR8 gene, has shown
altered miRNA biogenesis, suggesting a role of
miRNAs in behavioral and cognitive deficits in
humans with 22q11 deletion (Stark et al., 2008).
Postmitotic neurons in the brain have shown
more severe defects in Dicer knockout mice
than DGCR8 knockout mice, which are both
ablated by the CamKII-Cre line, suggesting that
a subpopulation of miRNAs generated by Dicer
but bypassed by DGCR8 processing may play
an important role in postmitotic neuron development (Babiarz et al., 2011). In Drosophila,
Dicer1 and Pasha mutations but not Ago1 and
Ago2 mutations have shown disrupted olfactory
projection neuron phenotypes (Berdnik et al.,
2008).
Ablation of molecules in the miRNA biogenesis pathway has proven important roles of
miRNAs in neural development. However, the
weakness of such studies should also be noticed.
First, a large number of miRNAs is affected
when miRNA biogenesis is blocked, making
it critical to distinguish the role of individual miRNAs in neurogenesis. Second, Dicer is
also required for maintaining the heterochromatin assembly, likely by the short interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway, and cleaving long
strand Alu transcripts (Fukagawa et al., 2004;
Kanellopoulou et al., 2005; Yang and Lai, 2011).
Thus, phenotypes of Dicer deletion need to be
carefully interpreted.
APPROACHES TO OVEREXPRESSION OF miRNAs

miRNA mimics

Gain-of-function for a specific miRNA can be
achieved by overexpressing the mature sequence
of the miRNA. miRNA mimics can be chemically synthesized as oligonucleotides according

Manipulating miRNAs in neurogenesis

FIGURE 1 | Approaches to inhibition of miRNA function. (A) Normal
function of miRNAs is to suppress translation of the target mRNA with
an open reading frame (ORF), or cause mRNA degradation, by guiding
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to the 3 untranslated region
(3 UTR) of the mRNA. (B) miRNA inhibitors are antisense miRNA
oligonucleotides (AMOs), including 2 -O-methyl modified AMO, antagomir,
locked nucleic acid (LNA), phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide
(PMO) and peptide nucleic acid (PNA), and block miRNA silencing activity
by a complimentary binding to the mature miRNA. (C) miRNA is

to sequences of the endogenous miRNA. Double
stranded miRNA mimics, with the sequence of
one strand identical to the endogenous mature
miRNA, are usually used to increase the efficiency of augmenting miRNA expression. The
strand identical to the endogenous miRNA will
be loaded into the RISC complex and silence target genes as the endogenous (Martinez et al.,
2002). When designing a miRNA mimic, one
needs to be cautious to avoid formation of a
new miRNA from the complementary strand
of the mimic duplex. Since there is no additional sequence introduced in the target system,
the synthesized miRNA mimic has no vectorbased toxicity. Studies have shown that infusion of miR-132 mimics to the mouse visual
cortex blocks ocular dominance plasticity produced by monocular deprivation (Tognini et al.,
2011), and miR-137 mimics negatively regulates neural stem cell proliferation (Sun et al.,
2011). However, the transfection efficiency of
miRNA mimics is low, especially in neurons,
and the transfection is usually transient, which
has limited its application.

miRNA precursors

A vector-based technique has been used to
obtain a long-term stable expression of miRNAs by inserting the miRNA precursor sequence
downstream of the RNA polymerase III (Pol
III)-driven or Pol II-driven promoters in a vector system (Takamizawa et al., 2004; Chung
et al., 2006; McLaughlin et al., 2007). Plasmid
and virus-based overexpression of miRNA precursors allows ectopic expression of a miRNA
in specific regions and cell types in the nervous system, for instance introduction of the
miR-9 precursor plasmid in spinal motor neurons and the miR-124 precursor in mouse
subventricular zone stem cells (Cheng et al.,
2009; Otaegi et al., 2011b). However, the
amount of overexpression needs to be carefully optimized to minimize side effects, for
example consistent expression of miRNAs and
large amount of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs)
can induce serious liver injury and lead to
mouse lethality due to oversaturation of the
endogenous small RNA pathways (Grimm et al.,
2006).

Manipulating miRNAs in neurogenesis

miRNA biogenesis enhancement

Instead of manipulating miRNAs themselves,
miRNA expression levels can be modified by
modulating the miRNA processing pathway.
The fluoroquinolone antibiotic, enoxacin, has
been found to promote the biogenesis of
endogenous miRNAs. Among the upregulated
miRNAs, a number of them such as miR124a, miR-125a, miR-23a, and let-7b are highly
involved in neural development (Shan et al.,
2008). Moreover, enoxacin has been shown to
enhance the production of tumor suppressor
miRNAs and miRNAs associated with neurogenesis such as let-7, miR-125, and miR-7
by binding to the miRNA biosynthesis protein TAR RNA-binding protein 2 (Melo et al.,
2011). To manipulate biogenesis of individual
miRNAs, small molecule libraries have been
screened to identify a miR-122 activator in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Young et al., 2010).
While mechanisms by which small molecules
activate miRNA expression are largely unclear,
these studies have allowed development of novel
tools to manipulate miRNA expression such as
screening small molecules for activating miRNA
expression in neurogenesis.
The gain-of-function approach by overexpressing miRNAs has both advantages and disadvantages (Table 1). miRNA mimics can be
directly synthesized and delivered, making them
convenient to use. Plasmid or virus based
miRNA precursors are easy for delivery in tissues and cells that miRNA mimics are difficult
to introduce such as neurons. However, overexpression of miRNAs may cause side effects
such as oversaturation of the miRNA processing pathway. The efficiency of processing mature
miRNAs from their precursors can vary and may
affect their function. Using miRNA precursors
flanking with longer genomic DNA sequences
can improve the efficiency miRNA processing.
The miRNA biogenesis enhancement strategy
using small molecules is easy to administrate
in vitro and in vivo, and is able to elevate levels

of multiple miRNAs simultaneously, but it still
requires optimization to be able to elevate specific miRNAs. Nevertheless, overexpression of
miRNAs is a powerful approach to manipulate
miRNAs in neural development.
APPROACHES TO KNOCKDOWN OF miRNAs

miRNA inhibitors

Antisense miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs)
have been used as miRNA inhibitor to knock
down endogenous miRNA activity. The
sequences of these oligonucleotide analogs
are complementary to the endogenous mature
miRNAs, and function by directly binding
to the single strand mature miRNA to block
miRNA silencing (Figure 1B). We here highlight inhibitor technologies developed to block
miRNA silencing activities.
2 -O-methyl group modified AMOs. Native
oligonucleotides are sensitive to degradation
in serum or by endogenous cellular exonucleases and endonucleases, and their efficiency to
cross cell membranes is low, making them ineffective in C. elegans (Hutvagner et al., 2004).
Therefore, chemically modified AMOs has been
generated. 2 -O-methyl group modified AMOs
have been shown to significantly increase resistance to nuclease degradation, display enhanced
binding to miRNAs and inhibit endogenous
miRNA activities (Hutvagner et al., 2004). For
example knocking down let-7b and miR-124
using 2 -O-methyl AMO can promote proliferation of neural stem cells (Cheng et al.,
2009; Zhao et al., 2010a). Although 2 -O-methyl
group modified AMOs show longer survival
time in the intracellular environment than common DNA oligonucleotides, they are still unstable in serum (Lennox and Behlke, 2010). Since
nuclease degrades nucleic acids by breaking
the phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides,
replacing these bonds by phosphorothioate linkage in AMOs has been effective in reducing
degradation. The drawback of this modification,

however, is that it decreases the binding of the
AMO to its target miRNA.
Antagomirs. Antagomirs are 22–23 nt 2 -Omethyl modified, 3 end cholesterol-conjugate
RNA analogs that have a complementary
sequence to a miRNA. Some phosphodiester linkages in the phosphate backbone of
Antagomir are substituted by phosphorothioate
and the cholesterol conjugation facilitates the
in vivo delivery of this AMO. Studies have shown
that the antagomir for miR-122 exhibits specific
inhibition of miR-122 in the mouse liver by tail
vein injection, and the antagomir for miR-16
inhibits miR-16 expression in multiple tissues,
including direct injection of miR-16 antagomir
into mouse brains (Krützfeldt et al., 2005, 2007).
The advantage of antigomirs is that they are
nuclease resistant, and can be delivered into
cells directly without any vector assistant, which
avoids complication of using delivery vehicles.
The drawbacks of antagomirs are high usage
dose and possible off-target effects, which has
limited their application as a therapeutic reagent
in humans (Krützfeldt et al., 2005; Morrisey,
2010; Patrick et al., 2010).
Other 2 site modifications of AMOs have
been developed to produce more powerful miRNA inhibitors. Introduction of 2 O-methoxyethyl groups increases affinity and
specificity of binding to miRNAs compared to
2 -O-methyl analogs (Hutvagner et al., 2004).
Moreover, AMOs with both 2 Flouro (2 F) and
phosphorothioate backbone modifications have
been shown to display high efficiencies of inhibition of miRNAs, with an effect further enhanced
by addition of 2 -O-methoxyethyl groups to
both ends (Davis et al., 2006, 2009).

Locked nucleic acids (LNAs). In the LNA
molecule, the 2 -O and 4 -C of the ribose are
bridged by a methylene group, which results in a
bicyclic nucleotide with a locked conformation.
This specially locked structure stabilizes the
LNA/RNA duplex and makes them strongly
resistant to nuclease degradation (Kaur et al.,
2006). LNA probes have been extensively used
to detect spatiotemporal miRNA expression,
in such techniques as Northern blot analysis
(Valoczi et al., 2004), in situ hybridization
(Wienholds et al., 2005; Kloosterman et al.,
2006; Nelson et al., 2006) and miRNA expression profiling assays (Castoldi et al., 2006). In
addition to their use as probes, LNA-based
miRNA inhibitors have been designed by
forming an LNA core sequence with flanking
DNA sequences, generating a DNA-LNA-DNA

www.frontiersin.org

chimeric molecule. The DNA-LNA-DNA
oligonucleotides have been shown to inhibit
activities of miR-21 in glioblastoma cell lines
(Chan et al., 2005), and miR-181 in the differentiation process of mouse myoblasts (Naguibneva
et al., 2006). Moreover, LNA-only AMOs can
suppress miRNA bantam in cultured Drosophila
cells (Orom et al., 2006). Phosphorothioate
modified LNA-based miR-122 inhibitor can
markedly reduce miR-122 silencing activities
at lower dosages compared to the miR-122
antagomir (Krützfeldt et al., 2005; Elmén et al.,
2008). Inhibiting miR-219 by intracerebralventricular deliver of LNA AMO can increase
its target gene expression in prefrontal cortex
(Kocerha et al., 2009). Because of their high
efficiency blocking of miRNA activities, LNAbased AMOs have been developed for use as
therapeutic tools: an LNA-based miR-122 AMO
is under phase II clinical trail for anti-hepatitis
C therapy (Lanford et al., 2010).
Phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotides (PMOs). PMOs are designed as a
strategy in which the riboses of the nucleic acid
are substituted by 6-membered morpholine
rings, and the phosphodiester bonds are substituted by phosphorodiamidates to produce
stronger steric blocking of nucleases and prevent degradation. miR-124 has been shown to
regulate muscle cell fate in zebrafish by knocking down miR-124 activity using PMOs (Flynt
et al., 2007). Microinjections of PMOs targeting
miR-183 family members in zebrafish embryos
have demonstrated their roles in sensorineuron
fate determination (Li et al., 2010). To improve
bioavailabilities, further modifications of PMOs
have been developed, called vivo-Morpholinos,
which show more efficient penetration in
multiple tissues in vivo (Morcos et al., 2008).
Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs). PNAs are artificial DNA/RNA mimics that have peptides flanking the nucleic acid sequences to increase target
affinity, specificity, nucleases resistance and/or
cell penetration. Delivering PNAs directly by
either electroporation or conjugation of PNA
with cell penetrating peptides, or by linkage
of PNAs with four lysine residues has demonstrated inhibition of miR-122 activity in human
liver cancer cells (Huh7) and rat primary hepatocyte cells with high efficiency (Fabani and
Gait, 2008). PNA AMOs has also been shown to
inhibit miR-155 function in mice in vivo (Fabani
et al., 2010). By screening 11 cell-penetrating
peptides, Oh et al., have shown that a Tatmodified-conjugated PNA is the most effective

January 2013 | Volume 6 | Article 196 | 5

Zhang et al.

Manipulating miRNAs in neurogenesis

for delivering into cells and inhibiting miRNA
function without the assistant of transfection
reagents (Oh et al., 2010). PNA AMOs delivered
into neurons have been shown to suppress miR326 activities and cause an increased expression
of a synaptic plasticity-related gene Arc, indicating a promising approach in neuroscience
research (Wibrand et al., 2012).
The effects of AMOs need to be carefully
interpreted. Some studies have shown anti-heart
failure effect of miR-21 antagomirs, but some
have shown no effect, which is also supported by
genetic deletion study of miR-21 (Thum et al.,
2008, 2011; Morrisey, 2010; Patrick et al., 2010).
The difference is likely caused by high concentration of delivered antagamirs that can bind to
target tissues and induce non-specific disruptions of gene expression. The delivery methods
for antagomirs such as vein injections may interfere with tissue distribution and metabolisms
of AMOs, or cause toxicities. Optimizing AMO
design will reduce the amount of AMO usage
in vivo, and in turn reduce AMO toxicity and
off-target effects (Park et al., 2011).
miRNA sponges

miRNA sponge
An RNA transcript contains binding
sites designed to be targeted by a
specific miRNA or a family of miRNAs
to block the silencing activity of the
endogenous miRNAs to their putative
targets.
mRNA protector
An RNA transcript or oligonucleotide
contains a perfect complementary
sequence to the miRNA binding site on
the 3 UTR of a putative target mRNA.
It competes with endogenous miRNAs
for the binding site and prevents
miRNA/RNA association to block the
endogenous miRNA silencing activity.

Frontiers in Neuroscience

The transient nature of current AMO miRNA
inhibitors has driven the development of
new approaches, such as miRNA sponge,
to achieve long-term miRNA loss-of-function.
The miRNA sponge contains multiple binding
sequences complementary to a mature miRNA
and can bind to endogenous miRNAs and
block their silencing activity (Figure 1C). The
most common miRNA sponge design involves
the insertion of a tandem multiplex artificial
miRNA binding sequence into the 3 UTR of
a Pol II-driven reporter gene, such as green
fluorescence protein (GFP) or luciferase. The
miRNA binding sequence of the sponge can be
perfectly complementary to the seed sequence
of the miRNA and then bulged, or kept complementary at positions 9–12 (Ebert et al., 2007;
Gentner et al., 2009; Loya et al., 2009). The bulge
is constructed on purpose to protect against
RNA interference-type cleavage and degradation of the sponge RNA by the Ago2 component
of the RISC. Sponges with exact complementary to the target miRNA also have been shown
to have inhibitory effects (Ebert et al., 2007;
Ebert and Sharp, 2010). In addition, there is
a second miRNA sponge system that utilizes
the Pol III promoter to drive sponge expression, in which 5 and 3 stem-loop structures
are added to stabilize the RNA products to substitute the reporter gene in the Pol II promoter
system. Both Pol II- and Pol III-driven sponges

www.frontiersin.org

with bulged or perfect miR-20 binding sites have
been shown to successfully rescue miR-20 binding to its target sites (Ebert et al., 2007). An
advantage of using the sponge approach is that
binding sequences for a family of miRNAs (due
to the conserved seed sequences) or even completely unrelated miRNAs can be constructed
together in one vector. The silencing activities of
these miRNAs can be repressed simultaneously
to facilitate efficient suppression of multiple
miRNAs.
A miR-9 sponge has been shown to modify
motor neuron subtypes in the developing spinal
cord (Otaegi et al., 2011a). By optimizing the
sponge design, Otaegi et al., have shown that
a shorter spacing between binding sequences
and the inclusion of a coding gene improve the
sponge effect. Moreover, optimizing the number
of binding sequences also affects sponge activity
(Otaegi et al., 2011b).
Similar to the sponge, tough decoy (TuD)
RNA driven by RNA Pol III promoter (U6) has
been developed to achieve long term suppression of miRNAs using lentiviral based vectors
(Haraguchi et al., 2009). TuD RNAs containing
two miRNA binding sites with four extra nts
inserted in each and flanked by 3 nts linkers and
two stem structures, show the strongest miRNA
inhibition (Haraguchi et al., 2009). The use of
recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) to
deliver the TuD RNAs for let-7 and miR-122 has
shown strong, long term inhibition of let-7 and
miR-122 expression in mice (Xie et al., 2012).
The miRNA sponge and TuD RNA techniques have shown promising inhibition of
miRNAs in vitro and in vivo. However, the
design and efficiency of sponge and TuD RNAs,
as well as their delivery by either plasmid or
viral vectors, require careful examination for
individual miRNAs in the nervous system.
mRNA protectors

The approaches described above are focused on
direct manipulations of miRNAs, which may
affect expression of all target genes of these miRNAs. To evaluate the direct silencing activities
of miRNAs on their specific target mRNAs, the
mRNA protector technique has been developed.
The mRNA protector has a perfect complementary sequence to the miRNA binding site on the
3 UTR of a putative target mRNA and can compete with endogenous miRNAs for the binding
site, with higher affinity to prevent miRNA/RNA
association (Figure 1D). For example, Choi
et al., have used a PMO-based target mRNA protector in vivo to prevent the action of miR-430
on its target genes squint and lefty in zebrafish

January 2013 | Volume 6 | Article 196 | 6

Zhang et al.

Manipulating miRNAs in neurogenesis

(Choi et al., 2007). Another morpholino target
protector has been used to identify hairy1 as a
primary target for miR-9 in neural progenitors
in Xenopus (Bonev et al., 2011). Current mRNA
protectors using morpholinos are designed to
bind to the region of the target mRNA complementary to the miRNA seed sequence and
to 3 or 5 flanking sequences in the 3 UTR
(Choi et al., 2007; Bonev et al., 2011; Staton and
Giraldez, 2011). Whether oligo-based mRNA
protectors have a long term effect in vivo, and
the challenge of delivering mRNA protector oligos especially in mammals have limited their
application. Developing a plasmid- or virusbased mRNA protector strategy is an option to
achieve long-term and tissue specific exogenous
protector expression. Moreover, as a miRNA
often functions to regulate multiple target genes,
protecting only one target mRNA may not reveal
the full miRNA function. Nevertheless, due to
the specificity of mRNA protectors, they can be
used to screen major targets for a miRNA in
neurogenesis.
Small molecule inhibitors

have been explored. Using a luciferase-based
assay, azobenzene was identified to selectively
inhibit miR-21 transcription from more
than 1000 compound screened (Gumireddy
et al., 2008). Studies have demonstrated that
inhibitors for miR-122 show specific blocking
activity on miR-122 but no other miRNAs,
suggesting that small molecules can be used as
inhibitors for specific miRNAs (Young et al.,
2010; Connelly et al., 2012). These data further
indicate the feasibility of using small molecules
to inhibit miRNA function in neurogenesis.

DELIVERY TECHNIQUES TO MANIPULATE
miRNAs in vivo
The success of manipulating miRNA expression
in the nervous system relies on efficient delivery
systems. We here highlight the delivery techniques that can be used for examining miRNA
function in neurogenesis.
MICROINJECTION

Microinjection is one of the simplest methods for gene delivery. miRNA mimics or AMO
inhibitors can be injected into the yolk or
cytoplasm of early embryonic cells, using fine
glass needles with the assistant of a pressure
microinjector and micromanipulator, to interrupt miRNA function. For example, microinjection of miR-124a precursors at the 8-cell
stage revealed the role of miR-124a in early

eye development in Xenopus, and doublestranded miRNA let-7 was injected into the
zygotes of zebrafish and frogs (Kloosterman
et al., 2004; Qiu et al., 2009). Injections of
miR-183, miR-96 and miR-182 LNA inhibitors
in zebrafish embryos have demonstrated the
roles of these miRNAs in the development of
sensorineurons (Li et al., 2010). The miRNA
microinjection technique was also applied to
study the development of Drosophila (Berry
et al., 2009). However, microinjection in mammalian embryos and postnatal tissues is difficult, especially in the nervous system, which has
limited its application.
VIRUS INFECTION

Virus infection is a common tool to transport exogenous transgenes into target cells and
tissues in vitro and in vivo. Adenoviral (Ad)
vectors infect both dividing and non-dividing
cells and can be used in vitro and in vivo (Xia
et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2011). However, Ad vectors cannot integrate into the host genome,
and are found to elicit the immune response,
which has limited their use for long term studies
of miRNA effects (Bessis et al., 2004). Adenoassociated viruses (AAVs) work in both dividing
and non-dividing cells and unlike the Ad vector, the AAV does not induce strong immune
reaction and can integrate into the host genome
(Rutledge and Russell, 1997; Grimm and Kay,
2003). The AAV carried miRNA-based hairpins have been shown to efficiently knock down
the photoreceptor-specific gene Peripherin-2 in
the mouse retina (Georgiadis et al., 2010).
miR-183/96/182 sponges in the AAV have been
shown to inhibit activity of this cluster in the
photoreceptor of mouse eyes in vivo (Krol et al.,
2010). Retroviral vectors (RVs) including the
lentiviral vectors (LVs) are genome-integrating
vectors. The lentiviruses can express a gene
of interest in both dividing and non-dividing
cells, stem cells, zygotes and their differentiated
progeny, to maintain persistent gene expression
(Rubinson et al., 2003). Mice infected by miR326 or its sponge LVs have been used to examine the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (Du
et al., 2009). Studies have used RVs and LVs to
overexpress and knock down miR-124 in mice,
and demonstrated miR-124 function in postnatal and adult neurogenesis (Cheng et al., 2009;
Åkerblom et al., 2012).
Virus infection has the potential to target
cells and tissues other than the nervous system
and causes side effects when delivered. Some
viruses such as RVs and LVs may exhibit unexpected exogenous gene transcriptional silencing,

Manipulating miRNAs in neurogenesis

which hinders highly efficient transgene expression. These are the factors that should be considered when using virus infection to study miRNA
function in neurogenesis.
In utero/in ovo ELECTROPORATION

To conduct quick Gain-of-function and lossof-function studies for a gene of interest in the
developing nervous system, approaches such as
in utero or in ovo electroporation have been
widely used. This technique utilizes electric
field pulses to drive nucleic acid molecules
through pores generated in the cell membrane to introduce the exogenous transgene into
cells. The in utero electroporation technique
allows passage of the target gene plasmid DNA
into the lateral ventricle of mouse embryonic
brains through the uterus wall of the pregnant
mouse, and introduction of DNA constructs
into proliferative ventricular zone progenitor
cells (Nishimura et al., 2012; Pacary et al., 2012).
For example, functions of a brain-enriched miR137 in the developing mouse brain have been
tested using in utero electroporation (Sun et al.,
2011). In utero electroporation of miR-9 and
let-7 into embryonic mouse brains was used to
study neural stem cell fate determination (Zhao
et al., 2009a, 2010a). The role of miR-9 in motor
neuron subtype specification has been examined in the chick embryonic spinal cord using
in ovo electroporation (Otaegi et al., 2011a,b).
Inhibition and overexpression of miR-124 by
in ovo electroporation were applied to explore
its function in chick neural tube development
(Cao et al., 2007; Visvanathan et al., 2007).
Studies have reported successful expression of
an exogenous gene in primitive streak stage
embryos using electroporation (Yasuda et al.,
2000; Kobayashi et al., 2002). Electroporation
may cause variations of expression levels and
positions of an exogenous gene in neural tissues, and a large number of samples are required
to draw a reliable conclusion. Nevertheless,
in utero/in ovo electroporation is a powerful
tool to manipulate miRNA expression in specific
regions in the nervous system.
miRNA TRANSGENIC ANIMALS

Gain-of-function and loss-of-function
Approaches to altering function of a
coding gene or a non-coding RNA by
increasing and decreasing its expression
levels in specific cells or tissues,
respectively.

Frontiers in Neuroscience

Although the procedure to construct transgenic animals is time consuming, it is still
an effective strategy to test miRNA functions in vivo. miRNA gain-of-function can be
achieved by miRNA overexpression transgenic
constructs and loss-of-function can be achieved
in miRNA gene knockout or sponge expression animals. Similar to coding genes, miRNAs
can be ablated from the genome using DNA

www.frontiersin.org

recombination, and also depleted in specific
tissues via, for instance the Cre-LoxP system, to
generate miRNA conditional knockout mice or
tissue specific miRNA sponge transgenic mice
(Figures 1E,F).
To study the function of miR-132 in
hippocampal-dependant learning and memory,
a doxycycline-regulated miR-132 mouse line
has been generated to show activity-dependant
regulation of miR-132 in cognition (Hansen
et al., 2012). Conditional over-expression of
miR-9∗ and miR-124 under the control of the
nestin promoter in neural progenitors has been
shown to suppress their target gene BAF53a
and lead to progenitor proliferation defects
(Yoo et al., 2009). Transgenic mice with a
lymphocyte specific miR-17–92 overexpression
construct developed lymphoproliferative disease and autoimmunity and died prematurely
(Xiao et al., 2008).
miRNA knockout mice have been used to
reveal many aspects of miRNA functions (Park
et al., 2010). Functions of miR-208 in heart
growth, miR-155 in immune system and miR-12 in heart development have been demonstrated
in miRNA knockout mice (Rodriguez et al.,
2007; Thai et al., 2007; Van Rooij et al., 2007;
Zhao et al., 2007). Knockout mice of the miR17-92 cluster have revealed their critical function in embryogenesis (Ventura et al., 2008).
miR-133 knockout mice have proven subtle
function of miR-133 in midbrain dopaminergic neuron development (Heyer et al., 2012). In
the double knockout mice in which miR-9-2 and
miR-9-3 precursors are ablated, the brain development is severely affected due to proliferation
defects in neural progenitors (Shibata et al.,
2011). Conditional deletion of the miR212/132
locus using retrovirus-based Cre expression has
shown dendrite growth and arborization defects
in adult hippocampal neurons (Magill et al.,
2010). In other species, the gene knockout technique is also utilized to explore the function
of miRNAs in C. elegans and Drosophila (Clark
et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012).
Mature miRNA normally has several precursors with similar seed sequences and other
miRNA precursors may functionally compensate the knockout of a single miRNA precursor,
unless all precursors are ablated. For example,
less severe phenotypes of miR-182 ablation in
retina are likely caused by functional redundancy (Jin et al., 2009). miRNAs are often localized closely as clusters in the genome. Ablation
of a single miRNA without disturbing other
miRNAs is technically challenging. Generating
sponge transgenic animals can overcome these

drawbacks (Figure 1F). miRNA sponge transgenic mouse model that blocks the activity
of the miR-183/96/182 cluster simultaneously
and selectively in the retina has revealed their
important role in acute light-induced retinal
degeneration (Zhu et al., 2011). miR-29 sponge
transgenic mice have demonstrated the role of
miR-29 in suppressing intracellular pathogeninduced immune responses (Ma et al., 2011).
Moreover, fly miRNA sponge transgenics has
revealed the function of miR-8 in neuromuscular junction formation (Loya et al., 2009).
LIPOSOME, POLYMER, HYDROGEL, MICROSPHERE,
AND NANOPARTICLE

A recent study has shown that liposome encapsulated plasmids or oligonucleotides can pass
into the phospholipid bilayer, and cationic liposome protects oligonucleotides from nuclease
degradation and facilitates cell uptake (Zhao
et al., 2009b). However, liposome reagents are
usually toxic, initiate immune responses, prone
to accumulate in the reticuloendothelium system and have short half-life, all of which have
limited their applications (Chiarantini et al.,
2005; Aagaard and Rossi, 2007; Zhao et al.,
2009b). Alternatively, a study using lipid-like
materials called lipidoids to transfer 2 -Omethyl AMOs into cells has been proven to be
safe and efficient in mice, rat and non-human
primates models (Akinc et al., 2008). Moreover,
biodegradable polymers are a solution to the
problems of using liposomes. Polymer delivery
of oligonucleotides has been shown to exhibit
sustained release and better tissue distribution
(Chirila et al., 2002). Hydrogels, microspheres
and nanoparticles have also been evaluated for
their suitability to transport nucleic acids into
target cells and have been proved to be efficient, stable and of low toxicity (Rosi et al.,

Moreover, nanoparticles have potential to allow
the manipulation of miRNA expression by using
cell type specific targeting molecules, such as
peptides, ligands, antibodies and other bioactive molecules in neuronal cells. For example,
increased accumulation of miR-124 has been
detected in brains of mice with tail vein injection of a miR-124 nanocarrier (Hwang Do et al.,
2011).

CONCLUSIONS
Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the
importance of miRNAs in neural development
and function. Both gain-of-function and lossof-function approaches have been applied to
uncover the role of miRNAs in neurogenesis.
We here have systematically summarized new
techniques used to manipulate miRNA expression in vitro and in vivo and each approach
has technical advantages and disadvantages.
Combination of multiple approaches may be
necessary to further advance the investigation
of miRNA functions. Dysregulation of miRNAs
has been found to be associated with several
neurological disorders (Bian and Sun, 2011;
Fiore et al., 2011; Sibley and Wood, 2011; Junn
and Mouradian, 2012; Saito and Saito, 2012; Tan
et al., 2012). Taking advantage of miRNA synthesis and delivery techniques, miRNA manipulations are becoming a promising means of gene
therapy to treat human neurological diseases.
