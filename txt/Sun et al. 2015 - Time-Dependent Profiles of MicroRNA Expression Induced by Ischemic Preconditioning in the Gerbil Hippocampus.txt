MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critically important in both normal neuronal development and neurological diseases.
Although cerebral ischemia has been shown to alter the miRNA profiles of rats, the role of miRNA in the cornu
ammonis 1 region of the gerbil hippocampus under ischemic tolerance has not been studied. In the present
study, Mongolian gerbils were subjected to one or three times the nonlethal dose of 2-min transient common
carotid artery occlusion (tCCAO). miRNA microarray technology detected 251 miRNAs and the expression of
seven of these in terms of ischemic tolerance. They were compared at different time points: 1 day, 7 days,
1 month, and 6 months. mmu-miR-15a-5p, related to neurogenesis, showed increased expression after one dose
of 2-min tCCAO and was much higher after three doses. An increase in sha-miR-24 and oan-let-7b-3p, related to
transactivation response DNA-binding protein (TDP43), was observed after one dose of 2-min tCCAO, but the
peak was accelerated to an earlier period of reperfusion after three doses. In contrast, mmu-miR-125b-5p and
mmu-miR-132-5p, related to fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS), showed similar increases
at both doses. mmu-miR-181c-5p and mmu-miR-378a-5p, related to heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), also
showed accelerated expression after three doses. This data set provides new insight about miRNA expression
during neurogenesis, and related to TDP43, FUS/TLS, and HSP70, which may be useful when pursuing further
studies on the possible use of miRNAs as biomarkers in cerebral ischemic tolerance and neuroregeneration.

INTRODUCTION
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding ribonucleic
acids (RNAs) that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level (19,45). They function by binding to complementary sites on the 3¢ untranslated region of genes and
promote the recruitment of protein complexes responsible
for degrading messenger RNA (mRNA) and/or impairing
translation (31). The human genome has been estimated
to contain up to 1,000 miRNAs, and each miRNA affects
approximately 200 species of mRNAs (32). However, gerbil miRNAs have not yet been examined.
Several miRNAs have been found to target transcription
factors regulating embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal
and differentiation (44,50), and other miRNAs have been
shown to facilitate critical reprogramming toward induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (4,22,47). Recent studies
showed that various pathological conditions significantly
altered cerebral miRNA profiles, which could affect the
disease outcome (7) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (20),

stroke (21,34), tumor growth (40), Down syndrome (25),
and schizophrenia (6).
We previously reported that a single 2-min ischemia
induced no neuronal damage, but three repeated 2-min
ischemic insults caused neuronal damage, and significant
neuronal cell recovery subsequently occurred in the selectively vulnerable region cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) in the hippocampus (48). Short-period transient ischemia can induce
ischemic tolerance (23), which is a protective response
against several subsequent lethal ischemias and can induce
change in the cerebral miRNAome (13,43). Ischemic
preconditioning offers endogenous neuroprotection by
changing gene expression and altering protein synthesis
(46). miRNAs are critically important to both normal neuronal development and in many neurological diseases.
The gerbil model of transient global cerebral ischemia is
well studied, particularly the underlying mechanisms of
ischemic tolerance mainly to the pyramidal neurons in the
hippocampal CA1 region. Increased induction of neuronal

apoptosis is known to occur in this model (30). However,
the role of miRNA in the CA1 region of the gerbil hippocampus in ischemic tolerance and following neurogenesis
has not yet been studied.
We hypothesized that miRNAs may serve as important
mediators of RNA processing and resulting protein synthesis required for ischemic tolerance as well as neurogenesis.
Thus, we examined changes in miRNA expression in the
preconditioned gerbil hippocampal CA1 sector after transient common carotid artery occlusion (tCCAO).

defined method (28). Then, all brains were dissected,
quickly frozen in powdered dry ice, and stored at −80°C
until subsequent preparation.
All animal experiments were approved by the Animal
Committee of the Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama University. All institutional and national
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals
were followed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The bilateral hippocampal CA1 region of the frozen
brain was dissected and combined in a cryostat (HM 500M;
Microm Inc., Mound, MN, USA) at −18°C. Total RNA
containing miRNA was isolated from about 5 µg of the
hippocampal CA1 region suspended in RNA-Later ICE
(Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, USA) using a mirVana™
miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion). The concentration, quality, and integrity of total RNA were determined using a
NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (ND-1000; NanoDrop Tech,
Rockland, DE, USA). The ratio of OD260/OD280, which
was >1.8 for all RNA samples, was used to ascertain the
quality of RNA. RNA samples were stored at −80°C before
miRNA array studies.

Experimental Model
Experiments were performed with male Mongolian
gerbils (Japan SLC Inc., Shizuoka, Japan). The 10- to 12week-old gerbils weighing about 80 g were maintained in
a temperature-regulated room (23–25°C) at a 12-h light/
dark cycle for at least 7 days. The gerbils were fasted, but
were allowed free access to water overnight before surgery. In total, 18 gerbils were randomized into three groups.
When the animals began to regain consciousness after
anesthesia, both common carotid arteries (CCAs) of the
first and second groups (n = 8 each) were occluded with
surgical microclips (RS-5424; Roboz Surgical Instrument
Co., Gaithersburg, MD, USA) for 2 min of tCCAO. For
the second group (n = 8), secondary occlusion of both
CCAs for 2 min was induced 2 days later, and then in
the same way for tertiary occlusion, with a total of three
rounds of tCCAO at 2-day intervals. Gerbils of the
sham control (SC) group were treated only once with a
neck incision without any artery occlusion. The animals
were allowed to recover for 1 day, 7 days, 1 month, or
6 months at ambient temperature (23–25°C), then were
deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (IP, 40 mg/kg;
Kyoritsu Seiyaku Corporation, Saitama, Japan) and decapitated. SC animals were sacrificed in the same way just
after the sham operation.
tCCAO and Reperfusion
Transient global forebrain ischemia was induced into
gerbils by occluding bilateral CCA, as per our previous
method (3). Briefly, gerbils were lightly anesthetized after
inhaling a nitrous oxide/oxygen/isoflurane (69%:30%:1%;
Air Water Inc., Okayama, Japan) mixture. Body temperature was monitored in all animals, and was maintained at
37 ± 0.3°C by using a heating pad (model BMT-100; Bio
Research Center, Nagoya, Japan) during surgery. A midline
neck incision was made, and both CCAs were exposed.
Animals began to regain consciousness after the end of
anesthesia, and both CCAs were occluded with surgical
microclips. After 2 min of tCCAO, cerebral blood flow
was restored by removing the microclips. At 1 day, 7 days,
1 month, and 6 months after reperfusion, the animals were
euthanized as described above (n = 2) using a previously

Total RNA (Including miRNA) Isolation
From Gerbil Brain Samples

Gerbil miRNA Sequencing
For each SC or ischemic brain sample, an equal amount
of total RNA was pooled from three biological replicates
to generate enough RNA (approximately 1,000 ng) for
deep sequencing (Table 1). Briefly, the isolated total RNAs
of each sample were resolved on a denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA)
for size selection, and these small RNAs (£30 bases) were
ligated to a pair of Solexa adaptors at the 5¢ and 3¢ ends
using T4 RNA ligase. After ligation and purification,
adapter-ligated small RNAs were reverse transcribed
and amplified for 15 cycles (cDNA RT-PCR) with a pair
of adapter complementary primers in order to produce
sequencing libraries. PCR products were then purified and
directly sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument (Illumina Inc., San Diego, USA).
miRNA Microarray Analysis
Groups of gerbils subjected to tCCAO were sacrificed
at various reperfusion periods (1 day, 7 days, 1 month,
and 6 months; n = 2 at each time point). To perform the
miRNA array experiment, total RNA (2–5 µg) was size
fractionated on a Microcon centrifugal filter (YM-100;
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). To the small RNAs
(<300 nucleotides), poly-A tails were added at the 3¢ end
mediated by poly(A) polymerase, and nucleotide tags were
ligated to the poly-A tails. Each sample was hybridized to
a microarray (LC Sciences, Houston, TX, USA) that contained gerbil miRNA probes. Thereafter, an oligonucleotide

was ligated to the poly-A tail for later staining with fluorescent dye Cy3. Hybridization was performed overnight
using µParaFlo® microfluidic technology. Hybridization
images were collected using a laser scanner (GenePix
4000B; Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and digitized using Array-Pro image analysis software (Media
Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA). Correlations between
fluorescence signal intensities from the laser scanner and
expression levels of different miRNA sequences were generally proportional. Since fluorescence intensity was the
read-out of the laser scanner, fluorescence intensity data were
expressed with no absolute units in the figures of this study.
Statistical Analysis
All data in this study are presented as means ± SD.
Data from different groups were normalized and statistically
analyzed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s
post hoc comparison. The normalized hybridization data of
the microarrays were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis using the Euclidian distance function. To increase the
validity of the data, cross-comparison matrices were generated. For example, data from the two sham chips were crosscompared with the two tCCAO chips (at each time point)
to generate a matrix of four comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (ver. 13.0; IBM, Armonk,
NY, USA). All tests were considered statistically significant at a value of p < 0.05, as per our previous report (12).
RESULTS
miRNA Expression Profile in Gerbil Hippocampus
A total of 1,067 miRNAs (LC Sciences, Houston, TX;
USA) were screened in samples of the CA1 region from
gerbils subjected to tCCAO. A total of 251 miRNAs were
detected in samples of one or three doses of tCCAO. Since
no miRNA data for gerbils are available, the sequences of
mouse and some other animal species’ miRNAs were used
for this study (Fig. 1A, Table 1). Each column in Figure
1B–E represents a single sample, and each row represents
a single miRNA. Black squares represent the median level
of miRNA, and green or red squares represent lower or
higher levels than the median level of miRNA expression, respectively.

Hierarchical clustering of the miRNAs detected in the
brain showed four distinct clusters for neurogenesis and
protein expression (Fig. 1B–E). Cluster B contained Mus
musculus (mouse)-let-7b (mmu-let-7b), Macaca mulatta
(rhesus monkey; mml)-miR-9, mmu-miR-10b, mmu-miR15a, mmu-miR-15b, Equus caballus (horse; eca)-miR-16,

Ornithorhynchus anatinus (platypus; oan)-miR-125, mmumiR-133 (a, b), mmu-miR-146b, Gorilla gorilla gorilla
(gorilla; ggo)-miR-146b and rno-miR-146b, related to
neurogenesis (18,27,29); cluster C contained mmu-let-7

mmu-miR-24, Sarcophilus harrisii (Tasmanian devil;
sha)-miR-24, mmu-miR-33, mmu-miR-132, mmu-miR-143,
mmu-miR-330, and mmu-miR-574, related to 43 kDa transactivation response DNA-binding protein (TDP43) (9,10,
24); cluster D contained mmu-miR-9, oan-miR-9, mmumiR-12, mmu-miR-132, mmu-miR-192, mmu-miR-199
(a, b), and sha-miR-199a, related to fused in sarcoma/
translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS) (38); cluster E contained mmu-miR-181 (c, d), mmu-miR-200 (a, b, c), and
mmu-miR-378 (a, b, c, d), related to heat shock protein
70 (HSP70) (41,49).
Target Analysis of Differently Expressed miRNAs
Among the above four clusters, miRNA expression
profiles for mmu-miR-15a-5p, sha-miR-24_L+3R+1, oan-let7b-3p_R+2, mmu-miR-125b-5p, mmu-miR-132-5p, mmumiR-181c-5p, and mmu-miR-378a-5p were compared in
the CA1 subfield of gerbils subjected to one or three
doses of 2-min tCCAO. Heat maps showed the pattern
of miRNA expression among the different experimental
groups. These expressed miRNAs were used for further
analyses (Figs. 2, 3, 4).

The signal strength of mmu-miR-15a-5p for the hippocampal CA1 region is shown in Figure 2. Signal strength
was 820 ± 22 in the SC brains (Fig. 2, circle). After one

both groups of 2-min tCCAO at both doses. From the
baseline level of the SC brain (17,508 ± 2,915) (Fig. 3A,

DISCUSSION
In the present study, miRNA microarray technology
detected 251 miRNAs from the hippocampal CA1 region
of gerbils after tCCAO. Among these miRNAs, seven
miRNA expression profiles were compared in terms of
ischemic tolerance in gerbils subjected to one or three
doses of 2-min tCCAO (Table 1, Fig. 1). mmu-miR-15a5p for neurogenesis showed increased expression after
one dose of 2-min tCCAO, which was much higher in
the three-dose group (Fig. 2). Time-dependent increases of
sha-miR-24 and oan-let-7b-3p for TDP43 were observed
after one dose of 2-min tCCAO, but the peak time accelerated to an earlier period of reperfusion after three doses
(Fig. 3B, D). In contrast, mmu-miR-125b-5p and mmumiR-132-5p for FUS/TLS showed a similar increase in
both groups after one or three doses (Fig. 3A, C). mmumiR-181c-5p and mmu-miR-378a-5p for HSP70 also
showed accelerated expression after three doses (Fig. 4).
Mongolian gerbils are particularly susceptible to bilateral
carotid occlusion, which results in transient global brain
ischemia, due to an incomplete circle of Willis (15). We
already reported typical cresyl violet staining of the hippocampal CA1 region in our previous article (48). Moreover, hippocampal CA1 cells are the most vulnerable region
in cerebral ischemia (17). CA1 pyramidal neurons both in
experimental animals and in humans undergo selective cell
death after transient ischemia (8). No change in cell density
of the CA1 pyramidal neurons was observed between the
SC group and the gerbil group subjected to a single 2-min
tCCAO from 1 day to 6 months later. However, in the
gerbil group subjected to 2-min tCCAO three times, neuronal loss was observed in the CA1 region. Although
most hippocampal CA1 neurons survived at 1 day after
3 × 2-min tCCAO, large numbers of CA1 neurons were
gradually lost from 3 to 7 days. After the significant loss
at 7 days, CA1 cell density gradually recovered from 1 to
6 months (48). Although single 2-min ischemia depletes
high-energy phosphate compounds and perturbs protein
synthesis, it has not been reported to cause neuronal death.
Therefore, 2-min ischemia was selected as mild ischemic
treatment for subsequent neuroprotection (36). In the gerbils’
hippocampal CA1 regions, 2-min ischemia for ischemic
preconditioning is extremely effective in providing protection
against cell death.

Our previous study showed that ischemic preconditioning
offers a way to induce endogenous neuroprotection and
neurogenesis in gerbils (48). Changes in TDP43, FUS/TLS,
and HSP70 proteins were involved in this function. Significant changes to TDP43 and FUS/TLS were observed in
the ischemic brains. The colocalization of TDP43 with
markers for RNA transport and stress granules suggests that
TDP43 may play a role in sequestering and regulating the
stability of mRNAs necessary for the neuronal response to
stress or injury (37). TDP43 and FUS/TLS are both DNA/
RNA-binding proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, mRNA splicing, transport, and translation (39). Previously, we showed that ischemic preconditioning accelerated
HSP70 gene expression at the transcriptional level, ameliorated the translational disturbance of mRNA to protein,
and saved CA1 cells from subsequent lethal ischemia (2).
Molecular mechanisms indicate how ischemic preconditioning alters the balance between cell survival and cell
detrimental signaling pathways.
Transient cerebral ischemia reprograms the response of
nerve cells for subsequent ischemia. A previous report
suggested that neuroprotection by a short period of transient ischemia may depend on altered miRNA expression
(46). Ischemic tolerance can be obtained by a large
change in gene expression, the functions of which influence protein turnover, cell cycle regulation, and ion channel
abundance. For this tolerance, an endogenous genomic program may be present, serving as an adaptation to improve
survival against oxygen limitation (14). The microarray
findings in this study suggest that miRNAs are effectors
of ischemic tolerance (Fig. 1).
The present study shows that transient forebrain ischemia induces a gradual increase of miR-15a neurogenesis
in the hippocampus (Fig. 2). We previously found that
three repetitions of 2-min ischemia caused neuronal damage in selectively vulnerable hippocampal CA1 neurons, but
exhibited a significant recovery after 7 days to 6 months
(48). In the present study, miR-15a showed an increase up to
6 months after one dose of 2-min tCCAO, but the increase
was much greater in the three-dose group (Fig. 2, filled
squares). As was reported in cancer cells (11,35), miRNA-15
may promote neuronal survival by regulating neurogenesis
and the apoptosis pathway in this tCCAO model.
Related to the miRNA pathway, TDP43 and FUS/TLS
are associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration
(FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (33,38). Let-7b
miRNA expression was downregulated following TDP43
knockdown in culture cells (10), and the expression of
some miRNAs decreased or increased in TDP43 mutant
flies (18). miR-24-1* was lower in a PGRN [+, (pro)
granulin] FTLD TDP patient than in a PGRN (−) FTLD
TDP patient (24). FUS affects the biogenesis of miRNAs
for neuronal function, differentiation, and synaptogenesis

with miR-125b and miR-132 (16,26,42). The present
study showed that the expression of miR-24 and let-7b
for TDP43 accelerated to an earlier period of reperfusion
after three doses (Fig. 3B, D), but the expression of
mmu-miR-125b-5p and mmu-miR-132-5p for FUS/TLS
did not show any evident acceleration (Fig. 3A, C). We
previously found that the redistribution of both TDP43
and FUS/TLS immunoreactivity to cytoplasm was accelerated to an earlier period of reperfusion after three
doses of 2-min tCCAO from 3 months to 7 days or from
7 days to 1 day, respectively (48). Thus, the remarkable
acceleration of TDP43 may be well correlated to the
present expression data of miR-24 and let-7b for TDP43
(Fig. 3B, D).
HSP70 is a major stress protein, which is strongly
induced under stresses including cerebral ischemia, heat,
and metal toxicity (1,3,5). miR-181 was identified as a regulator of several HSP70 family members, and an increased
level of miR-181a is associated with a decrease in endoplasmic reticulum GRP78 protein related to cerebral ischemic injury (41). Cardiac ischemic preconditioning of mice
decreased HSP70 related to miR-378* microRNAs (49).
Our previous immunohistochemical finding that HSP70 was
induced only at 7 days after three doses of 2-min tCCAO is
well correlated to our present data of mmu-miR-181c-5p
and mmu-miR-378-5p, which accelerated at 1–7 days
(48) (Fig. 4).
In summary, the present study shows the profiling of
miRNAs for ischemic preconditioning after tCCAO in
gerbil and identifies distinct regulation patterns for seven
miRNA clusters. These data could provide new perspectives
of miRNA expression proteins for neuroprotection, TDP43,
FUS/TLS, and HSP70, not only in transient cerebral ischemia but also in ischemic preconditioning. These results
may be useful for pursuing further studies on the possible use of miRNAs as biomarkers in cerebral ischemia
and neuroregeneration.
