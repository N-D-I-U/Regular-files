ABSTRACT
Several genes encoding proteins critical to
the neuronal phenotype, such as the brain type II sodium
channel gene, are expressed to high levels only in neurons.
This cell specificity is due, in part, to long-term repression in
nonneural cells mediated by the repressor protein
REST兾NRSF (RE1 silencing transcription factor兾neuralrestrictive silencing factor). We show here that CoREST, a
newly identified human protein, functions as a corepressor for
REST. A single zinc finger motif in REST is required for
CoREST interaction. Mutations of the motif that disrupt
binding also abrogate repression. When fused to a Gal4
DNA-binding domain, CoREST functions as a repressor.
CoREST is present in cell lines that express REST, and the
proteins are found in the same immunocomplex. CoREST
contains two SANT (SW13兾ADA2兾NCoR兾TFIIIB B) domains, a structural feature of the nuclear receptor and
silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid human receptors
(SMRT)-extended corepressors that mediate inducible repression by steroid hormone receptors. Together, REST and
CoREST mediate repression of the type II sodium channel
promoter in nonneural cells, and the REST兾CoREST complex may mediate long-term repression essential to maintenance of cell identity.

Two distinct repressor domains have been identified and
characterized in REST (6, 7). These domains are located in the
amino and carboxyl termini of the protein. Both domains are
required for full repression in the context of the intact molecule, but each domain is sufficient to repress type II sodium
channel reporter genes when expressed as a Gal4 fusion
protein (6). The C-terminal repressor domain contains a C2H2
class zinc finger beginning approximately 40 aa upstream of the
stop codon. Deleting this domain, or introducing a point
mutation critical to the zinc finger motif, abolishes repressor
activity (6). Because zinc finger motifs often mediate protein–
protein interactions, we proposed that REST might function in
conjunction with other nuclear factors or corepressors.
In this study, we find that repression of the type II sodium
channel promoter by REST requires a newly identified protein, CoREST, which fulfills the criteria for a bona fide
corepressor. CoREST is a repressor; mutations that disrupt
CoREST’s binding to REST also interfere with REST repression. Endogenous REST and CoREST proteins form a complex in cells that do not express the type II sodium channel
gene.

A large number of genes encoding neuronal phenotypic traits,
including ion channels, neurotransmitters, synaptic proteins,
and cell-adhesion molecules, are expressed only in neurons.
One mechanism important in establishing and maintaining this
neural specificity involves the DNA-binding protein REST兾
NRSF (RE1 silencing transcription factor兾neural-restrictive
silencing factor) (1–4), which serves to block expression of its
target genes in nonneural tissues. Such maintained gene
repression is in contrast to the more dynamic repression
mechanism that regulates inducible gene expression in response to steroid hormone receptors, one of the best-studied
mammalian repressor mechanisms (for review, see ref. 5).
One REST target gene essential for neuronal physiology is
that encoding the brain type II voltage-dependent sodium
channel. This ion channel is required for the propagation of
fast electrical signals in neurons, in the form of neuronal
impulses, and is not expressed in nonneural tissues. As is true
for other REST target genes, there is a reciprocal relationship
between expression of the type II sodium channel gene and
expression of REST. Additionally, when a REST expression
plasmid is cotransfected into neuronal cells along with a type
II sodium channel reporter, the expression of the reporter gene
is reduced dramatically (1). This result indicates either that
REST alone is sufficient to repress its target genes or that
REST accessory factors are present in neuronal cells despite
the absence of REST.

Two-Hybrid Screening. The REST cDNA used for bait
(LexA-C-REST) contains amino acids 525-1097 of REST. G.
Hannon (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY) provided the HeLa cell cDNA library. Library
screens were carried out, as described previously (8, 9), by
using HIS3 and LacZ reporters and the L40 strain provided by
R. Sternglanz (State University of New York at Stony Brook).
Specificity of the interaction was examined by a mating assay
between the positive L40 transformants and an AMR-70 strain
expressing REST-related proteins [LexA-N-REST, amino acids 1–525; LexA-C-RESTM1, amino acids 525-1097 (Cys-1062 3

LexA fusion proteins not related to REST. All cDNAs were
characterized by sequence analysis.

the phagemid according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Stratagene) and characterized by chain-termination sequence
analysis (Amersham Pharmacia) by using an ABI 300 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). One clone extended
the published sequence of KIAA0071 by 101 aa and contains
227 nt of 5⬘ untranslated region. This cDNA (termed CoR5b)
was joined to KIAA0071 to generate full-length CoREST
(described below).
Plasmid Constructions. A CoREST expression vector (pcDNACoREST) was constructed by inserting an EcoRI-BstXI
fragment from Cor5b and a BstXI-XbaI fragment from
KIAA0071 into pcDNA1.1amp (Invitrogen). Cloning a
BsaBI兾EcoRI-blunted fragment of CoREST cDNA into
pcDNA3.1A (Invitrogen) linearized with EcoRV created an
epitope-tagged version of CoREST (CoREST myc). Cloning
CoR EST cDNA into vector pSG424 (6) created
Gal4CoREST. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) CoREST
vector used in the pulldown assays contains amino acids
109–293 of CoREST. The CoREST sequences were placed
in-frame with GST in the vector pGEX-3X (Amersham Phar-

(provided by J. Trimmer, State University of New York at
Stony Brook) created an epitope-tagged version of the zinc
finger domain of the C terminus of REST (HA-C3, amino
acids 1009–1097). LexA-N-REST (amino acids 1–525) was
created by a three-way ligation among pBTM116 cut with
BamHI and SalI-blunt, a BamHI-ClaI fragment of pCBY
REST2, and a ClaI-HincII fragment of REST. LexA-C-REST
(amino acids 525-1097) was created by cloning a HindII-PstI
fragment of NH7 (1) into pBTM116 cut with BamHI-blunt and
PstI. LexA-C-RESTM1 (amino acids 525-1097, Cys1062 3
Arg) was created by a three-way ligation of an EaeI-PstI
fragment from C3M1 (6) plus a HindII-PstI fragment of NH7
(1) into pBTM116 cut with BamHI and PstI. LexA-C3-REST
(amino acids 1013–1097) was generated by cloning a PCR
fragment containing amino acids 1013–1097 into pBTM116 cut
with BamHI and PstI. The REST cDNAs lacking the Nterminal REST domain (REST⌬N; REEX 8) lacking the
C-terminal zinc finger domain (REST⌬C; REEX9) or containing a point mutation in the zinc finger motif (RESTM1;

(CAT) reporter genes, pSDK7 and UAS type II, were described previously (1, 6).
GST-Pulldown Assay. Radiolabeled REST proteins (35S)
were made in TNT-coupled transcription兾translation reactions (Promega). The REST protein was incubated with 15 ␮g
of GST or GSTCoREST (amino acids 109–293) in binding
buffer (11) for 1.5 hr at 4°C, and then 80 ␮l of glutathioneSepharose beads (Pharmacia) preblocked with 5% BSA was
added. The mixture was incubated for 1 hr at 4°C. Beads were
washed six times with binding buffer. Bound proteins were
eluted by boiling the beads with sample buffer, fractionated by
SDS兾PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography.
Antibodies. Rabbits were injected with GSTCoREST (amino acids 109–293) by Pocono Rabbit Farms (Canadensis, PA).
The polyclonal antibody ␣CoREST was affinity-purified by
following standard techniques (12). The monoclonal ␣-myc
and ␣-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies and the polyclonal
␣-Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) antibody were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

hour with 30 ␮l of protein G-agarose (GIBCO). Immunoprecipitates were washed two times with washing buffer (PBS兾350
mM NaCl containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and two times with
PBS, and then were eluted in sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting by using
rabbit polyclonal REST antibody (1) and detected by using
chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia). Preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts was as described
previously (13).
Cell Culture and Transient Transfection. PC12 and L6 cells
were grown as described (6). HEK293 cells were maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% BCS. The HEK293 and PC12
cells were transfected by using FuGENE 6 (Roche) or electroporated, respectively. Control experiments were carried out
by using molar equivalent amount of empty vector. The total
amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding
pBluescript SR (Stratagene). CAT assays were performed 48
hr after transfection as described (6).

RESULTS
To identify proteins that might mediate repression through the
C-terminal zinc finger motif of REST, a fragment corresponding to the C-terminal half of REST (amino acids 525–1097)
was fused to the DBD of LexA and used in a yeast two-hybrid
genetic screen with a HeLa cell–Gal4 activation-domain
cDNA library. A screen of 7.6 ⫻ 106 clones yielded two
identical cDNAs encoding a 183-aa fragment, and this fragment did not interact with several other, unrelated LexA fusion
proteins (data not shown).
A search of the GenBank database revealed that the isolated
cDNA was identical to a cDNA coding for a protein of
unknown function isolated from a human myelocarcinoma cell
line (KIAA0071; accession no. D31888; ref. 10). A full-length
cDNA was isolated from a HeLa library by using KIAA0071
as probe, and the deduced ORF was found to encode a 482-aa
protein (Fig. 1a, accession no. AF155595). The putative initiator methionine conforms to a Kozak consensus sequence
(14) and is preceded by an in-frame stop codon. This protein
was designated CoREST.
The predicted CoREST primary structure contains two

Adf1 (18) suggests that there is a conserved functional role for
this arrangement of SANT domains. Interestingly, a Drosophila-expressed sequence tag (accession no. AA392295) that
predicts an ORF with homology to the N-terminal portion of
CoREST (dCoREST) was identified by a GenBank search.
Sequence analysis of the cDNA and alignment of the predicted
sequences indicates that the dCoREST and hCoREST predicted proteins are 84% identical over a span of 114 aa (Fig.
1c). Included in this region is a SANT domain that is nearly
identical in the two proteins.
Western blot analysis, using an antibody raised against a
GSTCoREST fusion protein, determined that endogenous
CoREST expressed in cell lines migrates in SDS兾PAGE with
an apparent molecular mass of 66 kDa (Fig. 1d). Transfection
of a myc-tagged CoREST migrates at about 70 kDa (Fig. 1d).
Both the endogenous and the transfected CoREST migrate as
a doublet, suggesting posttranslational modification. Western
blotting also showed that CoREST was present in a wide
variety of neural (PC12, GH3) and nonneural (HeLa, L6
skeletal muscle, COS) cell types (Fig. 3a). This result is in good
agreement with previous Northern blot analysis, using the
clone KIAA0071 as a probe, which indicated that CoREST
mRNA was expressed ubiquitously in adult human tissues
(unpublished data and ref. 10).
The specificity of the interaction between REST and CoREST was examined in several ways. In yeast two-hybrid assays
(Fig. 2b) CoREST (amino acids 109–293) was found to
interact strongly with the C-terminal half of REST (C-REST)
(Fig. 2a), as well as with a smaller C-terminal REST fragment
(C3) containing the zinc finger motif known to mediate
repressor activity. Furthermore, a point mutation in the zinc
finger motif (C-RESTM1) that abolished repression (6) also
abolished the REST–CoREST interaction. CoREST did not
interact with the N-terminal part of REST (N-REST) containing the initiator methionine and the eight zinc fingers that
constitute the DBD.
To extend these results, a direct interaction between REST
and CoREST was demonstrated by using a GST pull-down
assay (Fig. 2c). Full-length REST (amino acids 1–1097) transcribed and translated in vitro was incubated with GSTCoREST or GST alone. REST associated specifically with GSTCoREST. There was no interaction between CoREST and
REST⌬C (Fig. 2a), which lacks the C-terminal zinc finger. A
point mutation in this motif (RESTM1) decreased the binding
to GSTCoREST.
Cell types that express CoREST were identified by Western
blotting (Fig. 3a). In contrast to REST, which is expressed only
in nonneuronal cell lines, CoREST was expressed in all cell
lines tested. Because L6 skeletal muscle cells express the
highest levels of REST (data not shown), these cells were used
to test for in vivo interactions between endogenous REST and
CoREST by using ␣CoREST and control antibodies. Western
blotting revealed the presence of REST epitopes in the
␣CoREST and not in control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3b).

FIG. 4. CoREST exhibits repressor activity when fused to a Gal4DBD and mediates repressor activity of REST. (a) Gal4-DBD (Gal4;
amino acids 1–147) or Gal4CoREST expression vectors were transfected into HEK293 and PC12 cells, with a UAS type II CAT reporter
gene (molar ratio of 1:1). (b Upper) Gal4REST lacking the N-terminal
repressor domain (Gal4REST⌬N) was transfected into HEK293 cells
along with a UAS type II CAT reporter gene. The role of CoREST was

(Gal4REST⌬N ⫹ C3 ⫹ CoREST). (Lower) REST lacking the Nterminal repressor domain (REST⌬N) was transfected into PC12 cells

along with an RE1 type II reporter gene. The role of CoREST was

derepression was tested by overexpressing CoREST (REST⌬N ⫹ C3
⫹ CoREST). CAT activity was monitored by TLC and autoradiography. Statistics were performed by using the nonparametric Mann–
Whitney U test. ⴱ, P ⬍ 0.056 for REST⌬N ⫹ C3 ⫹CoREST compared

If CoREST is a bona fide corepressor, in addition to binding
to REST, CoREST might exhibit repressor activity. To test this
idea, CoREST was fused to the DBD of Gal4 (Gal4CoREST)
and cotransfected into PC12 and HEK293 cells along with a
UAS type II sodium channel CAT reporter (6). This reporter
is driven by the type II promoter but is missing the RE1
sequences. Transfection with the Gal4 DBD alone had no
effect on reporter expression (Fig. 4a). In contrast, transfection of Gal4CoREST repressed UAS type II reporter activity
very effectively in HEK293 cells (between 15- and 20-fold
repression; Fig. 4a). Furthermore, CoREST also repressed
reporter activity in neuronal (PC12) cells (Fig. 4a), which lack
REST.
To provide further evidence that CoREST mediates repression by REST, a competition assay was performed. In this
assay, REST⌬N (Fig. 2a) was cotransfected with a cDNA
coding for a small fragment of REST containing the CoRESTbinding site (C3; Fig. 2a). The functional consequence of the
competition, if endogenous CoREST indeed is mediating
repression, should be an increase of the reporter activity
(derepression). This result was observed using both nonneuronal (HEK293) (Fig. 4b Upper) and neuronal (PC12) cells
(Fig. 4b Lower). The effect of the competitor protein could be
reversed by overexpression of CoREST (Fig. 4b). As a control,
the DBD of REST (p73; ref. 6) was transfected along with
Gal4REST⌬N and C3 in HEK293 cells. Under these conditions, the activity of the reporter gene was similar to that
observed with the competitor (C3) alone, showing that the
effect of CoREST was specific (data not shown). Western blots
showed that the expression of C3 or C3 plus CoREST in
HEK293 cells did not decrease the expression of
Gal4REST⌬N (Fig. 4c) and that C3 is present in both nuclear
(N) and cytoplasmic (C) extracts of HEK293-transfected cells
(Fig. 4d).

DISCUSSION
We have identified a factor, CoREST, that is part of the
repressor mechanism leading to neural-specific expression of
a large set of genes. CoREST and REST are present in a
complex in nonneuronal cells, and CoREST exhibits repressor
activity. Previous studies have shown that a C-terminal zinc
finger domain in REST mediates repression (6). We find that
the site of CoREST binding to REST maps to this domain.
Further, the same mutation that disrupts repressor activity of
REST by destroying the zinc finger motif (6) also blocks
binding of CoREST. Thus, CoREST is an essential component
of the repression mechanism used to block expression of type
II sodium channel reporter genes in nonneuronal cell types.
The predicted primary structure of CoREST contains a
repeated 50-aa motif termed a SANT domain (15). A SANT
domain is similar to the DBDs of myb oncoproteins. CoREST
contains two SANT domains separated by 191 aa, and the same
general arrangement also is found in the NCoR兾SMRTe
corepressors for steroid hormone receptors (16, 17). In addition, between the SANT domains, CoREST and NCoR兾
SMRTe contain a highly charged region. The function of the
SANT domains in corepressors is not known, but in Adf1, a
transcriptional activator that contains a similar dual-SANT
module, one SANT domain binds to DNA and the other is a
site of protein–protein interaction (18). CoREST is not known
to bind to any specific DNA sequence, but the first SANT
domain contributes to the binding to REST (unpublished
data). It is possible that CoREST helps stabilize binding of
REST to DNA via its SANT module, or, alternatively, CoREST may be involved in mediating other functions that
require these domains. The identification of a Drosophila
protein that is homologous to the amino terminus of CoREST

raises the possibility that some of the functions of CoREST, in
addition to those mediated by the SANT domains, are conserved in invertebrates.
The experiments showing that Gal4CoREST is a repressor
in neuronal PC12 cells (Fig. 4a) suggest that the function of
REST largely is to recruit the repression complex to the target
DNA in nonneuronal cells. These data, together with the
finding that CoREST is present in complexes with endogenous
REST in nonneuronal cells (Fig. 3b), indicate that CoREST
mediates REST repression through the REST C-terminal
domain. The competition experiments, whereby a REST fragment that interferes with CoREST binding to REST also
derepresses a type II reporter, further support this hypothesis.
Western and Northern blot analyses (data not shown and ref.
10) indicate that, unlike REST, CoREST is expressed ubiquitously in vivo. In particular, CoREST is present in brain,
where REST, in general, is expressed at very low levels. The
more widespread pattern of expression of CoREST in adult
animals suggests that, in addition to serving as a corepressor
for REST, CoREST might subserve a similar function for
other DNA-binding proteins as well.
The details of the mechanism by which REST represses its
target genes are not known. It is possible that CoREST
interacts and interferes with components of the basal transcriptional apparatus. Alternatively, CoREST could function as a repressor by recruiting, either directly or indirectly,
histone deacetylase activity (19 –23). The corepressors
NCoR兾SMRTe apparently repress through both mechanisms (19, 23, 24). In this regard, it will be interesting to
determine whether CoREST is independent of the NCoR兾
SMRTe pathway.
