Parkinson disease (PD) probably represents a syndrome of different
disorders and origins converging into a relatively uniform neurodegenerative process. Although clinical-pathological studies have suggested that the presymptomatic phase of PD may be relatively short,
perhaps less than a decade, the authors postulate that the pathogenic
mechanisms may begin much earlier, possibly even in the prenatal
period. Thus, some patients with PD may be born with a fewer than
normal number of dopaminergic (and nondopaminergic) neurons as
a result of genetic or other abnormalities sustained during the prenatal or perinatal period; as a result of normal age-related neuronal

P

arkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder
clinically characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, postural instability, and a variety of other
motor and nonmotor symptoms (Jankovic 2008). The pathological hallmark of PD is loss of dopaminergic (DAergic)
neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) with
subsequent loss of dopamine (DA) in the nigrostriatal system
and the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions, termed Lewy bodies. In addition, there is marked loss of non-DAergic neurons,
particularly in the caudal brainstem, and these may become
involved even before the DAergic neurons (Braak and others
2006). There is growing consensus among parkinsonologists
that PD is probably not a homogenous disease but a syndrome of different disorders, caused by genetic, environmental, and other factors (Moore and others 2005; Klein and
Schlossmacher 2007; Schapira 2008). Although the mechanism of neurodegeneration in PD is not clear, multifactorial
causes representing different, although possibly converging,
pathways have been proposed. The pathogenesis of PD has
been postulated to result from a complex interaction between
environmental and genetic factors leading to mitochondrial
dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and excitotoxicity, eventually leading to nigral DAergic neuron degeneration

attrition, they eventually reach the critical threshold (60% or more)
of neuronal loss needed for onset of PD to become clinically manifest. The authors review the emerging evidence that genetic disruption of normal development, coupled with subsequent environmental
factors (the so called multiple-hit hypothesis), plays an important
role in the etiopathogenesis of PD.

(Moore and others 2005; Klein and Schlossmacher 2007;
Schapira 2008). Impaired degradation of misfolded and
aggregated proteins is being increasingly recognized as playing an important role in the pathogenesis of PD (Fig. 1).
Besides the extensively studied ubiquitin-proteasome system,
an autophagy-lysosome pathway has been receiving growing
attention as an important machinery involved in the repair
and removal of misfolded proteins (Hegde and Upadhya 2007;
McNaught and others 2007; Pan and others 2008). Defects
or dysfunction of certain genes, such as α-synuclein gene
(PARK1), parkin gene (PARK2), ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal
hydrolases (UCHL-1) gene (PARK5), PINK1 (PARK6), DJ-1
(PARK7), LRRK2 (PARK8), and Nurr1, have been reported
to be linked with familial PD (Le and others 2003; Moore
and others 2005; Klein and Schlossmacher 2007). It is
believed that mutations in the α-synuclein gene, parkin gene,
and UCHL-1 may result in the failure of degradation of misfolded proteins, leading to neurodegeneration (Moore and
others 2005; Klein and Schlossmacher 2007; Fig. 1).
The adult brain contains more than 100 billion neurons
with more than 1015 synapses, but only a small portion of the
brain is affected in PD. It has been estimated that there are
400 000 DAergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), and
60% to 80% are lost before the first motor symptoms of PD
begin to emerge (Leenders and others 1990). Because DAergic
neurons in the SN are closely associated to PD, the molecular
mechanism underlying their development and adult cellular
properties has been the subject of intense investigations
(Alavian and others 2008). Although PD is typically considered an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, with symptoms usually starting in or after the sixth decade of life, the
biology of the disease may start decades prior to clinical
manifestation (Fig. 2). Environmental factors acting early in

Figure 1.   The common pathways of protein misfolding–mediated
pathogenesis in Parkinson disease (PD). Mutations in α-synuclein,
Parkin, UCHL-1, and possible other genes can cause the failure of
the protein degradation system (ubiquitin-proteasome system and
autophagy) or directly promote protein aggregation, which may lead
to neurodegeneration and clinical phenotype of PD.

life or even before birth have been postulated to predispose
some individuals to subsequently develop parkinsonism or
other movement disorders (Scott and Jankovic 1996; Jankovic
2005; Carvey and others 2006; Barlow and others 2007;
Wijemanne and Jankovic 2007; Fig. 2). Furthermore, inherited genetic defects or spontaneous gene mutations may result
in a formation of mutated proteins that interfere with normal
cellular viability because of either loss of function or gain of
function. This in turn can lead to a cascade of events that
initiates a progressive disease process with eventual loss of
normal reserves and of compensatory mechanisms (Wijemanne
and Jankovic 2007). Although many clinical-pathological studies have suggested that the presymptomatic phase of PD starts
about 4 to 6 years prior to the onset of symptoms (Jankovic
2005), we hypothesize that some patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD may be born with a fewer than normal number of
DAergic (and non-DAergic) neurons as a result of a nigrostriatal damage sustained in utero or during the perinatal period,
and with the normal age-related neuronal attrition, they reach
the critical threshold of 60% (or more) neuronal loss needed
for onset of PD to become clinically manifest (Fig. 2). Thus,
some patients with otherwise typical PD may not necessarily
have a primarily age-related neurodegenerative disorder, but
their symptoms may result from environmental or genetic disruption of normal development of DAergic (and non-DAergic)
systems very early in life (Martyn and Osmond 1995). In this
article, we will critically review the evidence for the notion that
some forms of PD may represent a neurodevelopmental disorder. Although PD clearly involves DAergic as well as nonDAergic neurons, in this review, we will focus primarily on the
DAergic system.

Figure 2.   The hypothesized disease course of Parkinson disease
(PD). The classical concept of PD is that the disease starts at the
middle age and advances gradually. Our new hypothesis suggests that
the disease starts at a very early age, perhaps even during the prenatal
or perinatal period, so that the affected individual predisposed to
develop PD starts with fewer than normal dopaminergic (DAergic)
neurons. As a result of age-related neuronal attrition, a threshold of
>60% loss occurs earlier than normal, and the progressive symptoms
of PD emerge, usually in the sixth decade of life.

Differentiation of DAergic Neurons
and the Multihit Hypothesis
Critical Determinants for DAergic
Neuron Development
The development of the cortical, subcortical, and other parts
of the central nervous system appears to be under separate
regulatory mechanisms involving different transcriptional factors (Jankovic and others 2005; Bystron and others 2008). For
example, the midbrain floor plate has been found to be a signaling center rich in radial glia-like cells that are neurogenic
and give rise to midbrain DAergic neurons (Bonilla and others
2008). Throughout life, transcription factors determine the
fate of this neuronal population and control essential processes such as localization in the ventral midbrain, their neurotransmitter phenotype, their target innervations, and synapse
formation (Alavian and others 2008). Over the past decade,
several transcriptional regulators, including Nurr1, Lmx1a,
Lmx1b, Msx1, Pitx3, SHH, Engrailed 1, Engrailed 2, Wnt-1,
Wnt-3, and Wnt-5, have been identified as responsible for the
development and maintenance of midbrain DAergic neurons
(Goridis and Rohrer 2002; Jankovic and others 2005;
Andersson and others 2006; Abeliovich and Hammond 2007;
Parish and others 2007; Fig. 3). Lmx1a and Msx1 have been
found to be critical intrinsic DAergic neuron determinants,
sufficient to trigger DAergic neuron differentiation (Andersson
and others 2006). Early activity of Lmx1a is necessary to
induce the expression of Msx1, complementing Lmx1a by
inducing the proneural protein Ngn2 and subsequent neuronal differentiation (Andersson and others 2006). Some

30   The Neuroscientist / Vol. 15, No. 1, February 2009

neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF),
and transforming growth factor (TGF) also participate in
DAergic neuronal development (Jankovic and others 2005;
Park and others 2006). Another factor important in the development of midbrain DAergic neurons is TGF-α; in TGF-α,
knockout mice SN contains 50% fewer DAergic neurons than
that in control animals (Blum 1998). The homeobox transcription factors Engrailed 1 and Engrailed 2 are also involved
in the regulation of the development of DAergic neurons
(Alberi and others 2004). In double mutants null for both
genes, these neurons are lost by E14 earlier than in any other
described genetic model system for PD (Alberi and others
2004). Furthermore, gene silencing of Engrailed 1 and
Engrailed 2 in the postmitotic neurons by RNA interference
activates caspase 3 and induces apoptosis in less than 24 h
(Alberi and others 2004). This rapid induction of cell death in
DAergic neurons suggests that the Engrailed genes participate
directly in the regulation of apoptosis and may contribute to
the presymptomatic neuronal loss in PD. Of note, the
heterozygous null mice deficient of these two genes have an
adult phenotype that resembles key pathological features of
PD, showing a slow progressive degeneration of nigral DAergic
neurons, especially during the first 3 months of their lives
(Sgado and others 2006). Intriguingly, α-synuclein, a gene
recently linked to familial forms of PD, is regulated by Engrailed
1 and Engrailed 2 (Sgado and others 2006).

The Role of Nurr1 in PD: Neuronal
Maturation and Development
Transcription factors of the Nur and retinoid X receptor subgroups have been found to play an important role in
DA-mediated
functions,
particularly
neuroadaptation
(Levesque and Rouillard 2007; Maden 2007). The Nurs are
part of the nuclear hormone receptor family, defined as the
NR4A subgroup, which includes Nur77 (also known as
NR4A1 and NGFI-B), Nurr1 (NR4A2), and Nor1 (NR4A3;
Jankovic 2005; Levesque and Rouillard 2007). Nurr1, a member of the orphan nuclear receptor gene superfamily, is a
critical genetic factor regulating the development and maintenance of midbrain DAergic neurons (Zetterstrom and others
1996; Jankovic and others 2005). This transcription factor is
a product of immediate-early genes whose expression and
activity are regulated in a cell-specific manner by a variety of
extracellular mitogenic, apoptotic, and differentiation stimuli.
A few Nurr1-regulated genes have so far been identified. For
example, Nurr1 has been found to regulate the expression of
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and vesicular monoamine transporter-2
(VMAT2) in DA cell lines (Schimmel and others 1999;
Hermanson and others 2003). Recently, Volpicelli and others
(2007) reported that BDNF is a downstream target of Nurr1
transcription factor in rat midbrain neurons. Mice lacking the
orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1, which is normally expressed
in developing neurons, fail to generate midbrain DAergic neurons (Zetterstrom and others 1997). In homozygous Nurr1deficient mice (Nurr1–/–), DAergic neurons are absent in
the SN and ventral tegmental area (VTA) but are preserved
in other regions (Le, Conneely, Zou, and others 1999).
Heterozygous animals (Nurr1+/–) have reduced DA levels and

Fig. 3.   Gene regulation of dopaminergic (DAergic) neuron development and Parkinson disease (PD). The development and maturation
of mesencephalic DAergic neurons before birth is a complex process
that requires the participation of numerous genes and factors, including Otx, Shh, En1, En2, Pax-2, Pax-5, Lmx1-b, Pitx-3, Wnt, FGF,
Msx1, and Nurr1. Abnormalities or dysfunction of any stage during
the development of DAergic neurons are hypothesized to be linked
with PD. It is suggested that some PD may have fewer DAergic neurons or decreased DAergic function even at birth. The progressive loss
of DAergic neurons or decline in DAergic function may result in
clinical PD.

are more susceptible to the effects of 1,2,3,6-methylphenyl-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) than wild animals (Le,
Conneely, He, and others 1999). Although the Nurr1–/– animals die within 1 day after birth because of an inability to suck
milk, the Nurr1+/– mice appear otherwise normal, although
they tend to exhibit slowness of movement with age as compared with wild animals (Le, Conneely, He, and others 1999;
Jiang and others 2005). Nurr1 is highly expressed in the SN,
VTA, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and other subcortical
areas (Saucedo-Cardenas and others 1998). Nurr1 is downregulated in the brains of aged individuals and in patients with
PD (Chu and others 2002). Furthermore, the level of Nurr1
in the SN appears to decrease with age and seems to correlate
with disease progression (Chu and others 2006).
The human analog of the murine Nurr1 and rat RNR-1
genes is NR4A2 (previously called NOT for nuclear receptor of
T cells) gene, localized on 2q22-q23 (Mages and others 1994).
Studies are currently under way to determine if mutations in
this gene affect the development of the DAergic system and
increase predisposition to PD. Indeed, at least three point
mutations have been found in the NR4A2 gene in patients with
PD (Le and others 2003; Grimes and others 2006; Jacobsen
and others 2008). We initially reported that mutations in exon
(-291Tdel and -245T→G sequence variation in 5′ untranslated region) in familial PD cases and a homozygous polymorphism in intron 6 of the Nurr1 were associated with typical PD
(Xu and others 2002; Le and others 2003). A third novel mutation (heterozygous C-to-G transversion resulting in serine-tocysteine substitution) in the translated region of exon 3 was
found in a nonfamilial PD, resulting in a change of p.
Ser125Cys adjacent to the ERK1/2 phosphorylation site and
subsequently leading to a marked reduction of Nurr1-induced
transcriptional activation (Grimes and others 2006; Jacobsen
and others 2008). Zheng and others (2003) found that a

Alternative Hypothesis of Parkinson Disease / Le and others   31  

heterozygous, rather than homozygous, single base pair insertion in intron 6 (NI6P) in the Nurr1 gene was associated with
a greater risk of PD. These mutations are rare and may be race
and region restricted because other reports have not been able
to find mutations in the Nurr1 gene among their PD patients
(Ibanez and others 2004; Nichols and others 2004; Tan and
others 2004; Healy and others 2006). In addition, quantitatively measuring the level of Nurr1 mRNA in human peripheral
blood lymphocytes has revealed a significant decrease of Nurr1
expression in patients with PD (58% reduction vs non-PD
healthy controls and 39% reduction vs neurological disease
controls; Le et al, 2008). Thus, the expression of Nurr1 may be
a reliable biomarker for PD and its progression.
There is an emerging body of evidence suggesting that a
cross-talk between Nurr1 and several other transcriptional
factors and neurotrophic growth factors may exist in different
development and maturation stages of mensencephalic
DAergic neurons (van den Munckhof and others 2003). Pitx3
is the bicoid-related homeodomain-containing transcription
factor that is expressed only in mesencephalic DAergic neurons (Smits and Smidt 2006; Smidt and Burbach 2007).
Although the expression of Pitx3 is independent of Nurr1,
Nurr1 may be critical for the maintenance of Pitx3 in the late
stages of DAergic neuron development (Saucedo-Cardenas
and others 1998). Pitx3 is highly expressed in DAergic neurons of the SNc and ventral VTA (Smits and Smidt 2006).
Many studies have found a close association of Pitx3 with TH
expression during development and adulthood (Hwang and
others 2003; Nunes and others 2003; Smits and Smidt 2006;
Smidt and Burbach 2007), indicating that DAergic neurons
in the SNc are specifically regulated by Pitx3. Pitx3-deficient
aphakia mice failed to develop the nigrostriatal pathway, showing a complete loss of DAergic neurons in the SNc, the main
region of degeneration in PD, whereas DAergic neurons in the
VTA were less affected (Hwang and others 2003; Nunes and
others 2003). Furthermore, variants in the regulatory regions
of the Pitx3 gene may be associated with PD (Bergman and
others 2008; Fuchs and others 2008). Overexpression of Pitx3
in stem cells has been used to enhance DAergic neuron differentiation aiming at providing cell replacement therapy for
PD (Chung and others 2005; Martinat and others 2006).
Moreover, overexpression of Pitx3 up-regulates the expression
of BDNF and GDNF in SH-SY5Y cells and in primary DAergic
neuron cultures (Peng and others 2007), demonstrating that
Pitx3 is important not only in regulating DAergic neuron phenotype but also in the production of growth factors to promote
the survival of DAergic neurons. Therefore, Pitx3 might be a
potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PD.
Neuronal development is largely dependent on proper
orchestration and control of gene expression, largely regulated
by newly discovered microRNAs (miRNAs; Gao 2008).
Recently, a miRNA, miR-133b, has been identified that is specifically expressed in midbrain DAergic neurons and is deficient in midbrain tissue from patients with PD (Kim and others
2007). This miRNA regulates the maturation and function of
midbrain DAergic neurons, possibly by regulating Pitx3. In
fact, abnormal regulation of certain genes, such as the fibroblast growth factor 20 (FGF20) on 8p21.3-22, has been suggested as a novel mechanism of individual susceptibility to the
development of PD (Wang and others 2008). The risk allele

(rs12720208) of the gene FGF20, another development-related gene of midbrain DAergic neurons, disrupts a binding site
for miRNA-433, which correlates with increased α-synuclein
expression (Wang and others 2008). In addition, Nurr1 also
interacts with Wnts, a family of glycoproteins that regulates cell
proliferation and differentiation (Castelo-Branco and others
2003). Another factor with which Nurr1 interacts is p57kip2, a
kinase inhibitor of the CIP/KIP family, whose expression in
postmitotic differentiating midbrain DAergic neurons partly
depends on Nurr1 (Castelo-Branco and others 2003). Nurr1
also interacts with the GRIK5 gene, which codes for kainatepreferring glutamate receptor subunit KA2 (Chew and others
1999).

Gestational Environmental Factors
in Initiation and Development of PD
Multihit Hypothesis in DAergic Neurons
There are many examples of disorders caused by an insult in
utero or in the perinatal period that remain static until later in
life, when the symptoms begin to progress (Scott and Jankovic
1996; Wijemanne and Jankovic 2007). Although the mechanism of conversion from the silent stage to a progressive course
is not often readily apparent, a failure of normal compensatory
mechanisms or second insult has been proposed as an explanation for this phenomenon. In addition, silent toxicity has been
proposed for persistent morphological and/or biochemical
injury without clinical manifestation (Reuhl 1991; Clarke and
others 2000; Barlow and others 2007). During this period,
however, the system has an increased vulnerability to a variety
of secondary environmental insults. Toxic exposures in early
development could determine long-term pathology in the central nervous system.
The multihit model explores the possibility that early
damage to the DAergic system could result in cell loss or high
vulnerability to a second environmental factor, which may
lead to critical loss of DAergic neurons and subsequent development of PD symptoms (Thiruchelvam and others 2003).
This multihit hypothesis has been tested in several models of
PD (Eells and others 2002; Jiang and others 2005). For
example, changes in locomotor activity, thought to be related
to decreased mesolimbic and mesocortical DA levels without
obviously altered striatal DA levels, have been reported in
adult, phenotypically normal Nurr1+/– mice when exposed to
MPTP (Eells and others 2002). Furthermore, old Nurr1+/–
mice (>15 mo) displayed a significant decrease in the rotarod
performance and locomotor performance compared with the
normal Nurr1+/+ mice and adult Nurr1+/– mice (Jiang and
others 2005). The reduction of rotarod and locomotor performance correlated with decreased striatal DA and Nurr1
mRNA levels in an age-dependent manner (Jiang and others
2005). In contrast, overexpression of Nurr1 in mouse neuronal stem cells has been found to have neuroprotective
effects against neurotoxin MPTP-induced cell death (Lee and
others 2002). Thus, we postulate that various transcriptional
factors are important not only in the early development of the
DAergic system but also in mediating compensation during
the silent stage and that as a result of prenatal, perinatal, or

32   The Neuroscientist / Vol. 15, No. 1, February 2009

postnatal environmental or genetic hits, a critical threshold is
reached, after which the course becomes progressive (Fig. 3).

Bacteriotoxin Lipopolysaccharide
One possible cause of PD is some prenatal event or process
that predisposes some individuals to start with fewer DAergic
neurons at the time of birth (Jankovic 2005; Logroscino
2005). Several studies have provided evidence in support of
this hypothesis. For example, in utero exposure to some toxins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), may reduce the number of normal DAergic neurons at birth. The loss of DAergic
neurons found in rats born to mothers exposed to LPS during
pregnancy mimics the progressive pattern of cell loss seen in
human PD (Thorsen and others 1998; Carvey and others
2006). Prenatal LPS exposures decreased striatal DA concentration and the number of DAergic neurons in both the SNpc
and VTA to a similar degree (∼25%) in 3-wk-old offsprings
(Ling and others 2004). Furthermore, the DAergic neuron
loss is accompanied by reduction in striatal DA, increases in
DA activity, and increases in production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha, which is present in
the brains of PD patients (Mogi and others 1994).

Paraquat and Maneb
Another study suggested that prenatal or early postnatal exposure to certain toxins, such as the herbicide paraquat and the
fungicide maneb, both of which adversely affect DA systems,
may reduce the number of DAergic neurons in the SN in
early development and enhance vulnerability to these toxins
when administered subsequently in adulthood (Barlow and
others 2004). Experimental animals exposed to maneb prenatally and to paraquat in adulthood show a dramatic decrease
(95%) in activity associated with decreased levels of striatal
DA and selective reduction in TH-positive neurons in the
SNpc (Barlow and others 2004). Furthermore, paraquat and
maneb exposure during critical periods of development could
permanently change the DA system and enhance its vulnerability to subsequent neurotoxin challenge (Thiruchelvam
and others 2003). Mice exposed early in life to two neurotoxins, paraquat and maneb, and subsequently exposed again as
adults presented with the most severe damage, showing a
70% reduction in motor activity 2 wk after the last toxic dose
(Thiruchelvam and others 2003). Striatal DA levels were
reduced by 37% after only the developmental exposure to
paraquat plus maneb compared with a 62% reduction after
adult reexposure, which suggests that the exposure during the
development stage produced a state of masked toxicity that
was revealed after adult reexposure and that the toxic effect
may be enhanced (Thiruchelvam and others 2003). Besides
paraquat and maneb, there are many other neurotoxins, such
as other pesticides, metals, and organic solvents, that are
known to affect the developing brain (Grandjean and
Landrigan 2006). These studies are consistent with the multiple-hit hypothesis (Sulzer 2007).

Genetic Defect Models and Latent Period
The recent discovery of specific genes (α-synuclein, parkin,
DJ-1, Pink1, Nurr1, and most recently LRRK2) that cause
familial forms of PD has contributed to the development of

novel genetic mouse models of PD. These models offer the
opportunity to examine the possibility that a gene defect may
be a promoter signal of neuronal degeneration, which could
be enhanced by late environmental factors and lead to development of disease. Several transgenic mouse lines including
α-synuclein knockout or overexpression of human α-synuclein
(wild-type, A30P, A53T, or A30P+A53T), parkin knockout,
DJ-1 knockout, and LRRK2 knockout have been generated
(Fleming and others 2005; Melrose and others 2006).
Although these transgenic mouse lines have subtle neurophysiological abnormalities, they are not associated with a
loss of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons, the pathological hallmark of PD (Fleming and others 2005; Melrose and others
2006). It is believed that these mice models may represent
the early stages of the disease or that they act as susceptibility
to the disease, but when coupled with environmental risk factors, including neurotoxins, they can lead to marked neuorodegeneration (Oliveira and others 2003). For example, in
mice expressing human α-synuclein, combined exposure to
two neurotoxins, paraquat and maneb, markedly enhanced
neurotoxicity (Thiruchelvam and others 2003). Interestingly,
only a specific mutant presents enhanced vulnerability to
neurotoxins, which suggests a specific gene-environment
interaction could be an early signal of DAergic neuron degeneration in animal models and in humans. Intriguingly, transgenic Drosophila models overexpressing both α-synuclein and
LRRK2 mutant genes are associated with a selective loss of
DAergic neurons, locomotor dysfunction, and early mortality,
whereas knock out of Pink1, Parkin, and DJ-1 genes mostly
causes severe mitochondrial abnormalities of muscle and
spermatid defects, without marked striatonigral degeneration
(Dodson and Guo 2007; Liu and others 2008; Trinh and others 2008). Because most of the PD-causing genes are
expressed in the embryonic or early postnatal stages, it is
quite possible that defects in these genes may adversely
affect the development of nigral DAergic neurons and other
neuronal networks involved in PD.
On the other hand, defects in genes important for the
nigral DAergic neuron development and survival lead to
severe nigrostriatal DAergic neuron agenesis and abnormal
motor and behavioral function (Fleming and others 2005;
Jankovic and others 2005; Riaz and Bradford 2005). For
example, in Nurr1 knockout mice, DAergic neurons showed
age-dependent degeneration, which is associated with deterioration in motor function and increased vulnerability to
MPTP and rotenone compared with the wild type (Le,
Conneely, He, and others 1999; Jiang and others 2005).
Furthermore, Pitx3-aphakia mice, heterozygous Engrailed
mutant mice, Lmx1α deficient mice, and Ngn2 knockout
mice provide good models to study the mechanisms of developmental DAergic neuronal loss and ways to prevent it (Sgado
and others 2006; Smits and Smidt 2006).
The possibility that prenatal toxin exposure may contribute to the development of a neurodegenerative disease of
the aged population raises interesting new pathogenic questions and draws attention to the possibility that in utero
exposure to neurotoxins may represent a heretofore unrecognized cause of PD (Barlow and others 2004; Cory-Slechta
and others 2005; Barlow and others 2007). This is also supported by the finding that the Y chromosome–linked, maledetermining gene Sry is specifically expressed in the SN of

Alternative Hypothesis of Parkinson Disease / Le and others   33  

the adult male rodent in TH-expressing neurons (Dewing and
others 2006). Just like estrogen may be neuroprotective in
females, Sry may be neuroprotective in males, and the deficiency in the SrY gene in males may lead to development of
PD (Dewing and others 2006). Toxic exposures that occur
early in development could determine long-term pathology in
the central nervous system.

Conclusion
There is emerging evidence that PD is not a single disease but
a syndrome of different disorders in which genetic, environmental, and other factors converge into a common final
pathology. Although traditionally viewed as an age-related disorder, PD may have an early, possibly even prenatal, onset as a
result of disruption of neuronal development, making the
nigrostriatal system vulnerable to subsequent insults. Although
in this review we focused on the midbrain DAergic system, the
other source of DAergic cells, namely the subventricular zone,
is also affected in the brains of patients with PD (Curtis and
others 2007). The multiple-hit, gene-environment hypothesis,
discussed here, is gaining support from various animal models
and should be regarded as a possible pathogenic mechanism
for PD. Further studies are needed to determine whether the
various development-related genes, such as Nurr1 and Pitx3,
interact with known PD-causing genes that lead to nigrostriatal DAergic and non-DA dysfunction, resulting in PD-related
pathology, including misfolding and aggregation of proteins
and formation of Lewy bodies (Balch and others 2008).
Advances in understanding the role of developmental genes and
their interaction with early and subsequent environmental
insults should provide insight into the etiopathogenesis of PD
and assist in planning future neuroprotective strategies.
