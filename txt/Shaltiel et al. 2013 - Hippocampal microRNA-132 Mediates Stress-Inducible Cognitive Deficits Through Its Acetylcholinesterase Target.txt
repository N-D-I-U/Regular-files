Abstract Diverse stress stimuli induce long-lasting cognitive deficits, but the underlying molecular mechanisms
are still incompletely understood. Here, we report three
different stress models demonstrating that stress-inducible
increases in microRNA-132 (miR-132) and consequent
decreases in its acetylcholinesterase (AChE) target are
causally involved. In a mild model of predator scentinduced anxiety, we demonstrate long-lasting hippocampal
elevation of miR-132, accompanied by and associated
with reduced AChE activity. Using lentiviral-mediated
suppression of ‘‘synaptic’’ AChE-S mRNA, we quantified
footshock stress-inducible changes in miR-132 and AChE
and its corresponding cognitive damages. Stressed mice
showed long-lasting impairments in the Morris water maze.
In contrast, pre-stress injected AChE-suppressing lentivirus, but not a control virus, reduced hippocampal levels of
both miR-132 and AChE and maintained similar cognitive
performance to that of naı̈ve, non-stressed mice. To dissociate between miR-132 and synaptic AChE-S as potential causes for stress-inducible cognitive deficits, we further
used engineered TgR mice with enforced over-expression

of the soluble ‘‘readthrough’’ AChE-R variant without the
30 -untranslated region binding site for miR-132. TgR mice
displayed excess AChE-R in hippocampal neurons,
enhanced c-fos labeling and correspondingly intensified
reaction to the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine. They further showed excessive hippocampal expression of miR132, accompanied by reduced host AChE-S mRNA and the
GTPase activator p250GAP target of miR-132. At the
behavioral level, TgR mice showed abnormal nocturnal
locomotion patterns and serial maze mal-performance in
spite of their reduced AChE-S levels. Our findings attribute
stress-inducible cognitive impairments to cholinergicmediated induction of miR-132 and consequently suppressed ACHE-S, opening venues for intercepting these
miR-132-mediated damages.

Acute and chronic stress can both induce anxiety (McEwen
and Gianaros 2011) and either impair learning and memory
performance (Diamond et al. 1999; Nijholt et al. 2004) or
enhance it (Blank et al. 2002). Manipulating cholinergic
neurotransmission in the hippocampus, which receives
extensive cholinergic innervations, changes the cognitive
control over executive function and error monitoring
(Carter et al. 1998), suggesting cholinergic involvement in
stress responses. Recent studies associate acute and chronic
stress reactions with specific microRNA (miR)-mediated
silencing of affected transcripts (Meerson et al. 2010).
MiRs are short (*22 nucleotides), non-coding RNAs that

123

Brain Struct Funct

regulate various molecular pathways (Bartel 2009; Krol
et al. 2010) by post-transcriptional gene silencing (Filipowicz et al. 2008; Rana 2007). Each miR may target
several mRNAs, often in specific locations on their
30 -untranslated region (30 -UTR) and can modulate entire
pathways in a rheostat-like manner (Chen et al. 2004)
[reviewed in (Soreq and Wolf 2011)]. However, the signaling pathway(s) controlling the levels of neuronal miRs,
the corresponding miR-target interactions involved in their
diverse functions and the consequent cognitive effects
remain incompletely understood.
MiR-132 is prominently neuronal-enriched, highly
induced by the cAMP-response element binding protein
(CREB). In cortical neurons, miR-132 enhances neuronal
morphogenesis and neurite outgrowth by decreasing the
levels of the Rho family member GTPase-activating protein, p250GAP (Vo et al. 2005). Mice engineered to overexpress miR-132 in forebrain neurons correspondingly
show marked increase in dendrite spine density, accompanied by deficits in a novel object recognition test
(Wayman et al. 2008). However, which neurotransmission
signal(s) are responsible for miR-132 changes and which of
its target(s) mediate these effects remained unanswered.
Another target of miR-132 is the acetylcholine hydrolyzing enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (Shaked et al.
2009; Meshorer and Soreq 2006). In acute psychological
stress, activated cholinergic neurons display rapid, yet
transient increases in a normally rare soluble AChE-R
splice variant (Kaufer et al. 1998) that replaces the ‘‘synaptic’’ AChE variant (Kaufer et al. 1998; Meshorer et al.
2002; Meshorer and Soreq 2006). In macrophages, AChE
suppression by miR-132 accentuates cholinergic signaling
(Shaked et al. 2009). In transfected neurons, tetracyclinecontrolled antisense suppression of AChE leads to
enhanced dendrite extension and causes hyper-locomotion
in engineered mice (Sklan et al. 2006). Taken together, we
surmised that miR-132-mediated suppression of hippocampal AChE levels may enhance cholinergic signaling,
contributing to the neurite extension, cognitive and locomotion impairments caused by stressful experiences.
To challenge these predictions, we sought appropriate
mouse models and experimental strategies. Our rationale
was as follows: (1) If indeed stress-inducible changes in
hippocampal miR-132 and AChE cause long-lasting effects,
miR-132 increases and AChE activity decreases should be
observed in different stress models and even several days
after the initiation of psychological stress. (2) If the changes
in miR-132 and ‘‘synaptic’’ AChE-S are inter-related, then
preventing one would avoid the other, and if these changes
are the cause for stress-induced cognitive deficits, then
preventing them both from happening would avoid these
deficits. (3) Alternatively, if miR-132 elevation by itself is
sufficient to cause the stress phenotype and cognitive

123

malfunctioning, then maintaining miR-132 excess even
under AChE-S suppression would cause cognitive deficits.
To investigate this triple hypothesis, we employed three
diverse stress paradigms: the acute predator scent test,
acute unpredictable footshocks accompanied by hippocampal AChE knockdown, and engineered mice with an
inherited anxiogenic-like phenotype (Salas et al. 2008) due
to enforced excess of AChE-R, but with a depleted miR132 binding site which ensures continuous suppression of
the host AChE-S, but not the transgenic AChE-R proteins
(Shaked et al. 2009). In the two latter models, we also
evaluated cognitive deficits evolving from the stress
exposure.

Methods
Animals
Mice were kept in an animal room at a constant temperature (22 ± 1°C) and a 12-h light/dark cycle with free
access to food and water. They were tested in the same
room under dim illumination (30 lux) by the same testers
between 10 and 16 h. All experimental procedures were
approved by The Hebrew University’s Committee for
Animal Experimentation (NS-08-11485-4).
Pharmacological intervention
Intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of 0.1 ml of 25 mg/kg pilocarpine hydrochloride (Sigma, Rehovot, Israel), or saline
followed 30 min habituation to a holding cage.
Stereotactic surgeries
Group housed C57Bl/6J 9 weeks old male mice underwent
stereotactic surgery, after which they were singly-housed
throughout all subsequent testing. Control mice were singly
housed as well. Mice were anesthetized by i.p. injections of
ketamine (50 mg/kg) (Forth Dodge, IA, USA) and domitor
(0.5 mg/kg) (Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland) mix, and then
mounted in a stereotactic apparatus for intra-hippocampal
injections. Coordinates of the injection sites (in mm) relative to bregma were AP: -2.0, L: 1.8, DV: -1.5. Bilateral
injections of 0.5 ul lentiviral suspensions were conducted
using a 10-l Glenco syringe (Houston, TX, USA). After
each injection, the needle was left in situ for 5 min before
being retracted to allow complete diffusion.
Water maze test
The water maze consisted of a round tank, 1.6 m in
diameter, filled with water. Mice were trained to find the

Brain Struct Funct

location of a hidden platform (16 cm in diameter), submerged 1 cm below the water surface, using extra maze
visual cues. The training part consisted of 4 trials per day,
with a 1-h brake between trials, for 3 days. The escape
latency, i.e., the time required by the mouse to find the
platform and climb on it, was recorded for up to 60 s. Each
mouse was allowed to remain on the platform for 30 s and
was then moved from the maze to its home cage. If the
mouse did not find the platform within 60 s, it was placed
gently on the platform for 30 s, and then returned to its
home cage. On the fourth day of the experiment, the
platform was removed and a probe trial was conducted:
mice were placed in the maze for 60 s, in which the
number of crosses over the four quadrants of the maze was
recorded. Increased swimming in the quadrant where the
platform was originally placed was considered as an indication of spatial acquisition. One day after the end of
behavioral tests mice were anesthetized by Isoflurane
inhalation and decapitated. Brains were removed and two
half sagital sections were immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen. One section was sliced in cryostat for Karnovsky–Roots staining experiments (Sternfeld et al. 2000) and
the other was taken for mRNA measurements. In brief,
AChE activity staining was conducted using the Karnovsky–Roots staining method (Karnovsky and Roots 1964;
Kaufer et al. 1998). 40-um frozen sections were incubated
at room temperature in soft shaking for 5 min. Staining
solution contained 2 mM acetylthiocholine iodide (Sigma,
Israel), dissolved in PBS, 5 mM sodium citrate, 3 mM
cupric sulfate, 0.5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 0.1 mM
butyrylcholinesterase specific inhibitor, ISO-OMPA.
Two unit serial maze
3- to 6-months-old female 30 UTR-null AChE and FVB/N
mice were group housed. Only females were taken for this
experiment due to their higher stress responsiveness compared with males (Goel and Bale 2010). Modular units
placed in a series constitute this maze (Quartermain et al.
1994). To complete one ‘‘run’’, a 22 h water-deprived
mouse must choose between turning right or left to receive,
at the end of the maze, a reward in the form of 40 ll of 5%
sucrose and one ‘‘run’’ is considered complete. Then the
mouse must shuttle back to the other end of the maze where
it gets the same reward. There were 5 runs per session; one
session per day. Quantitative measures of performance
include number of left/right choice errors and ‘‘retrace
errors’’—episodes in which a mouse moves in the wrong
direction (toward the end without a reward) (Farchi et al.
2007). Mice were euthanized 80–90 min after the behavioral experiment by an intra-peritoneal injection of
200 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital (‘‘Pental’’). Brains were
either fixed by transcardial perfusion with ice-cold 4%

paraformaldehyde containing 4% sucrose (pH 7.4) or
removed and kept frozen in -70°C.
Predator scent exposure and footshock acute stress
Group housed C57Bl/6J 9 weeks old male mice were
placed on well-soiled cat litter for 10 min (in use by the cat
for 2 days, sifted for stools) (Cohen et al. 2006) or were
placed in a footshock delivery system (Campden Instruments, UK) where they received seven inescapable electric
footshocks (0.3 mA; 2 ms) at unequal intervals over a total
period of 120 min.
Elevated plus maze
Anxiety-related behaviors were tested in a Plexiglas plusshaped maze containing two dark and enclosed arms
(30 9 5 cm with a 5 9 5 cm center area and 40 cm high
walls) and two 30 9 5 cm open and lit arms, all elevated
50 cm above ground. Individual mice were placed in the
center of the maze, tracked for 5 min with a video
camera, and then returned to their home cage. The plus
maze was wiped clean between trials with a 10% alcohol
solution.
Lentiviral procedures
The packaged virus was collected at 24 and 48 h posttransfection and concentrated using ultracentrifugation
(70,000g, 2 h, 15°C). Dilutions of concentrated virus were
followed by infection of HEK-293T cells with diluted
virus. The resulting titer (*1 9 109 infectious particles
per ml) was assessed for shRNA expressing viruses using
puromycin selection and for GFP expressing viruses by cell
fluorescence counting. Screening of two putative AChE
shRNAs, sh799 and sh800, designed to down-regulate
mouse/rat AChE levels was first conducted in neuronal-like
PC12 cells and compared to a control shRNA (shCON) that
does not target any mammalian gene. Both shRNAs
reduced the AChE-S variant and suppressed AChE total
activity in these cells, but only Sh799 down-regulated
overall AChE mRNA levels (Online Resources Fig. 1).
Viral infection of primary cortical cell culture
Cerebral cortex was separated from the brain of 15th
day embryos of FVB/N mice, minced, and cells plated
on poly-L-ornithine coated 12-well plates in Neurobasal
medium, 2% B27 supplement, 20% Glutamax and 20%
Penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY,
USA). 72 h post-plating, 250 ul of non-concentrated
medium containing viral particles was added to each well.

RNA procedures
RNA was extracted (RNeasy lipid tissue kit, Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA), DNase treated and its integrity confirmed by gel electrophoresis.
For SYBR green real-time PCR, cDNA synthesis (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) involved 1 lg RNA samples in
20 ll reactions. Duplicate real-time reverse transcriptase
(RT) PCR tests involved ABI prism 7900HT, SYBR green
master mix (Applied biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
and ROX, and a passive reference dye for signal normalization across the plate. Primer sequences are listed in
Table 1. 18S rRNA or GAPDH was used as reference
transcripts. Annealing temperature was 60°C for all primers. Serial dilution of samples served to evaluate primers
efficiency and the appropriate cDNA concentration that
yields linear changes. Melting curve analysis and amplicons sequencing verified the identity of end products.
MicroRNA quantification using The TaqMan MicroRNA
Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was
conducted in two-step RT-PCR kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For miR-132 (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) measurements, a reference transcript of SNO-135 (Applied Biosystems) was used.

to bregma. Images of each hippocampal sub-region were
acquired and analyzed using AnalySIS software (SIS,
Germany). Karnovsky staining of histochemical AChE
activity was as in (Sternfeld et al. 2000). In situ hybridization was essential as described (Berson et al. 2008).
AChE activity measurement
AChE activity was measured by Ellman’s assay (Ellman
et al. 1961) adjusted to multiwell plates and normalized
TM
according to the protein content of the cell lysate (DC
protein assay, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
The following statistical analyses were done using
STATISTICA9 and GraphPad Prism 5 software: Student’s
t test, one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA with Tukey
post hoc comparisons and Pearson’s correlation test.

Results
Elevated predator stress-inducible miR-132 associates
with suppression of AChE-S

Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry
The AChE-R C-terminal peptide (ARP) was labeled by a
rabbit polyclonal antibody (Berson et al. 2008). The common domain shared by both AChE variants was labeled
with goat anti-human AChE (Santa Cruz, CA, USA, antibody N19). c-fos was stained using rabbit anti c-fos
(Sigma, Rehovot, Israel). In co-localization studies, we
used fluorescein (FITC)-labeled donkey anti-rabbit to
visualize AChE-R and streptavidin-Cy3 to visualize general AChE. Two to three coronal brain sections were
sampled at an estimated distance of 2.8–3.3 mm posterior

Our first experimental model served to explore the interrelationship between a long-lasting stress phenotype,
induced by predator scent, increases in hippocampal miR132 and decreases in AChE-S. Seven days following a
predator scent stress (Fig. 1a), C57BI/6J mice subjected to
an elevated plus maze (EPM) showed sustained anxiety.
Compatible with previous reports on predator smell-stressed mice (Cohen et al. 2006), they spent less time in the
maze open arms and more time in its closed arms and
attempted fewer entries to the open arms compared to naı̈ve
mice (Fig. 1b–d). Given that miR-132 targets the AChE

Fig. 2 Neuronal AChE and the GTPase activator p250GAP are both
targets of miR-132. a The ‘seed’ region in miR-132 is complementary
to the targeted 30 -UTR in the AChE-S and P250GAP transcripts
[created using Targetscan and Pictar websites (Online Resources
Table 1)]. b Hippocampal mP250GAP mRNA, but not mAChE-S
levels are reduced in stressed compared to naı̈ve mice (Student’s
t tests: *p \ 0.05), likely reflecting different balances between the
rates of transcription and miR-132-mediated destruction of these two
transcripts

Fig. 1 Predator scent stress leads to inter-related miR-132 elevation
and AChE and p250GAP suppression. a Mice were exposed to the
predator scent test and 7 days later were tested in the elevated plus
maze (EPM). b–d Compared to naı̈ve, stressed mice spent less time in
the open EPM arms (b; Student’s t test: *p \ 0.05), more time in the
closed EPM arms (c; *p \ 0.05) and attempted less entries to the
open arms (d; *p \ 0.05). e AChE-S activation leads to miR-132
up-regulation, which in return down-regulates the AChE-S transcript.
f–h 7 days post predator scent exposure, hippocampal miR-132 is
up-regulated by *220% (f; Student’s t test, t18 = -3.22, *p \ 0.01),
AChE activity is reduced (g; Student’s t test, t23 = 2.00, *p \ 0.05)
and hippocampal miR-132 levels show significant negative correlation to AChE activity (h; Pearson’s test: r = -0.55; p \ 0.01)

mRNA transcript (Fig. 1e), we quantified hippocampal
miR-132 levels, which we found to be higher by *220%
compared to naı̈ve mice (Student’s t test: p \ 0.01;
Fig. 1f), accompanied by 25% reduction in AChE activity
(t test: p \ 0.05; Fig. 1g). A significant negative correlation between hippocampal miR-132 levels and AChE
activity suggested causal relationship (Pearson’s test:
r = -0.55; p \ 0.01; Fig. 1h), compatible with the
capacity of miR-132 to suppress AChE activity in cultured
primary neurons (Online Resources Fig. 2).
Our previous findings showed stress-inducible increases
in neuronal AChE gene expression (Meshorer et al. 2002;
Meshorer and Soreq 2002). Given that mRNA levels reflect
a steady state between its synthesis and degradation, we
predicted that the observed decline in AChE activity
could potentially mask a balance between increases in the
‘‘synaptic’’ AChE-S mRNA and miR-132-induced decreases in its levels. To find more information on miR-132

relationships with its neuronal targets, we quantified the
major AChE-S mRNA and the p250GAP transcript, with
predictably tighter hybridization and higher energy interaction with miR-132 (Fig. 2a). Intriguingly, p250GAP but
not AChE mRNA levels were suppressed in the predator
scent-stressed hippocampus (Student’s t test: p \ 0.05,
Fig. 2b), suggesting less robust stress-inducible transcription and/or more efficient destruction of p250GAP mRNA
under stress.
AChE-S knockdown prevents miR-132 up-regulation
and memory impairments
Predicting that the stress-inducible changes in hippocampal
miR-132/AChE-S impair the cholinoceptive capacities of
hippocampal neurons (Gray et al. 1996), we next set out to
establish an in vivo experimental model where these
changes could be avoided. To achieve this goal, we introduced AChE knockdown. For this purpose, we used a precalibrated shACHE agent targeted to the exon2 common to
the AChE-S and AChE-R transcripts (Fig. 3a) and which
efficiently infected cultured primary neurons (Fig. 3b),
reduced AChE activity by over 50% within 12–24 h postinfection (Fig. 3c) and suppressed AChE-S and AChE-R
mRNA levels as well as the common domain shared by
these two transcripts (Fig. 3d). Bilateral injection of this
agent to the hippocampus CA1 region of this AChE-targeted lentiviral shRNA (shAChE) was then followed by a
10-days healing period. At this time point, long after the
transient stress-inducible increases in hippocampal AChE
have ceased, histochemical staining showed reduced AChE
activity in the hippocampus of lentiviral injected mice,
with predictably larger reduction of AChE activity in

Lentivirus-injected mice were subjected, 10 days postinjection, to unpredictable footshock stress compared to
mice injected with a control virus (shCON) (Fig. 4a).
Naı̈ve and non-injected mice exposed to the footshock
stress were tested in comparison. Similar to predator scent,
footshock stress alone led to 63% increase in hippocampal
miR-132, and infection with control lentiviruses extended
the effect to a twofold increase in miR-132 levels. The
effects on miR-132 of both stress and the chronic state of
infection were completely prevented following shAChE
suppression (one-way ANOVA: p \ 0.003; Fig. 4b), suggesting that miR-132 elevation under stress is induced by
the reduced cholinergic neurotransmission which is prevented by AChE suppression. In rotorod tests, injected
mice showed normal performance reflecting unimpaired
motor coordination (Online Resources. Fig. 3). Nevertheless, all of the stressed mice, regardless of their treatment
spent less time in the open arms of the maze compared to
naı̈ve mice (one-way ANOVA: p \ 0.001; Fig. 4c), demonstrating that preventing miR-132 increases failed to
avoid the stress-inducible anxiety.
In the Morris water maze test, both shAChE-injected
stressed mice and naı̈ve mice learned to reach the hidden
platform faster than either non-injected or shCON-injected
stressed mice (post hoc test: p \ 0.05 for both, Fig. 4d),
which exhibited spatial learning deficits. By the third day
of learning trials, all four groups displayed the same escape
latencies; however, in the probe test, shAChE-injected
mice showed control-like spatial memory, unlike the deficits shown by the stressed non-injected and shCON-injected groups. Both naı̈ve and shAChE-injected stressed mice
crossed more frequently over the missing platform quadrant, deviating from either non-injected or shCON-injected
mice, at least in one time point; demonstrating better
learning capacity to reach the hidden platform and
reflecting better spatial memory (two-way ANOVA:
p \ 0.05; Fig. 4e, f).
shAChE-treated mice showed better cognitive performance that could potentially be due to the enforced
decreases in AChE-S, the prevented increases in miR-132,
corresponding changes in other transcripts (e.g., p250GAP)
or to all of these reasons combined. To test for probable
correlations between the measured molecular elements and
the modified cognitive performance of stressed mice, we
plotted the route traversed by each mouse in the first
quadrant as a function of the levels of relevant RNA
transcripts. Impressively, miR-132 levels in both control
and shRNA-injected mice showed a significant correlation
to the cognitive malfunction reflected in the route traversed
in the missing platform quadrant during the probe test

(Pearson’s test: r = -0.58; p \ 0.01; Fig. 5a). Normal
AChE mRNA levels were already retrieved at this time
following footshock stress; however, stressed and control

virus-injected mice but not stressed and shRNA injected
mice showed AChE mRNA up-regulation (one-way
ANOVA: p \ 0.001, Fig. 5b). Furthermore, as observed in
the predator scent test, p250GAP was down-regulated
following footshock stress, and intercepting AChE and
miR-132 up-regulation resulted in enlarged p250GAP
increases (one-way ANOVA: p \ 0.001; Fig. 5b). However, neither AChE-S mRNA nor p250GAP levels were
associated to the cognitive performance.
Chronic hippocampal miR-132 increases associate
with AChE-S and p250GAP decreases
To further challenge the causal association between miR132 and stress-inducible cognitive malfunctioning, we
sought an experimental model where miR-132 would be
elevated and AChE-S would be diminished. The AChE-R
over-expressing TgR mice present such a system. In TgR
mice, enforced expression of the human hAChE-R transcript leads to excessive ACh hydrolysis which in turn
elevates brain miR-132 levels (Shaked et al. 2009). The
elevated miR-132 may target nascent host AChE-S mRNA
but not the transgenic 30 UTR-null AChE-R transcripts
(Fig. 6a). Correspondingly, TgR mice show an anxiogeniclike phenotype accompanied by hyper-reactivity to nicotine
(Salas et al. 2008). Hippocampal miR-132 levels increased
by *2.7-fold in TgR mice compared to non-transgenic
FVB/Ns (Student’s t test: p \ 0.001; Fig. 6b). This predictably led to suppression of both host AChE-S and yet

by 2.7-fold in TgR compared to non-transgenic FVB/N mice

mice (Student’s t tests: *p \ 0.05)

more so, of p250GAP levels (Student’s t test: p \ 0.05;
Fig. 6c). Therefore, if AChE-S suppression could by itself
prevent stress-inducible cognitive decline, TgR mice should
show no such decline; but if miR-132 increases are the
cause, then these mice should present a stress phenotype.
Chronic AChE-S suppression associates
with intensified cholinergic hyper-excitation
The AChE-R transgene avoids miR-132 surveillance owing
to the lack of its native 30 -UTR (Fig. 7a). Therefore, the TgR
brain presents continuous excess of AChE-R which cannot
be suppressed, mimicking prolonged conditions of stress
(Meshorer and Soreq 2006). Of note, choline acetyl transferase (ChAT)-expressing cholinergic neurons appeared in
the engineered brains in normal numbers and size, with a
normal symmetric distribution between right and left hemispheres. In general, the engineered AChE-R protein accumulated in cholinoceptive brain regions that tend to express
the primary synaptic AChE-S variant [e.g., the CA1 and
dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex]. Typically, the neuronal cytoplasm, nucleus
and dendrite(s), but not axons, were stained (Fig. 7b–e).
Furthermore, TgR mice presented an extreme sensitivity to
cholinergic stimulators. Thus, intraperitoneal exposure to
25 mg/kg of the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine (Dickson
and Alonso, 1997) induced massive up-regulation of
AChE-R in multiple cholinergic brain regions (Fig. 7f, g).
Specifically, the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex showed

numerous AChE-expressing cells with further intensified
labeling under pilocarpine treatment. Under control conditions, several regions showed intense AChE-R labeling; but,
pilocarpine treatment caused massive AChE-R elevation
throughout the hippocampus (Fig. 7f). Yet more specifically, both TgR and strain-matched FVB/N control mice
showed intensified labeling under pilocarpine administration
compared to saline-injected mice of the Ca2?-responsive
CREB-dependent c-fos mRNA, associated with contextual
fear conditioning (two-way ANOVA: p \ 0.05; Fig. 8a).
The c-fos labeling pattern largely overlapped the observed

AChE protein increases in the hippocampal CA1 region of
the transgenic mice, revealing an hyper-excitatory sensitivity (Frankland et al. 2004) with c-fos significantly correlated
to AChE-R labeling (Pearson’s test: saline r = 0.86,
p \ 0.05; pilocarpine r = 0.77, p \ 0.05; Fig. 8b, c).
TgR mice show motion and cognitive malfunctioning
Nocturnal activity monitoring of TgR mice versus nontransgenic controls revealed interchangeable hyper- and
hypo-locomotion activity of the transgenics during the
dark, but not the light phase of the day compared to controls (Fig. 9a, ANOVA repeated measures: p \ 0.001).
Given parallel, yet distinct changes in the nocturnal activity
of mice over-expressing the synaptic AChE-S variant
(Cohen et al. 2002), the altered nocturnal activity of the
TgR mice likely reflects changes in cholinergic signaling.
At the molecular level, hippocampal host AChE-S protein
amounts were 55% reduced in TgR mice compared to
FVB/N controls (t test: p \ 0.01; Fig. 9b). To evaluate
learning capacities and adaptive behavior, we subjected

these mice to the serial choice maze and measured the
animals’ ability to avoid right or left turning and/or retrace
errors (See Fig. 9c for a scheme of the maze). The cognitive test was conducted during the light phase of the day
where no changes in total locomotion activity were
observed between the two tested groups. TgR mice displayed significantly more right/left choice errors and
retrace errors compared to control FVB/N mice (two-way
ANOVA: p \ 0.005; Fig. 9d). Close examination of videotaped maze behavior revealed two major types of error:
‘‘trapping behavior’’—running in a repeated path several
times without correction, and lack of spatial orientation
with respect to reward location, manifested in repeated
visits at the end of the maze where the last reward was
given and hence no reward was to be expected. Our tests of
sensory-motor function did not reveal deficits (Online
Resources: Methods) and thus excluded the possibility that
trapping behavior was due to the secondary effects of the
transgenic intervention.
Stress-inducible total alterations and inter-individual
variability in miR-132 and p250GAP
Our working hypothesis predicted that the key processes
which are activated under stress conditions would be common to different animal strains and stress paradigms.
Therefore, we compared the outcome of the three models we
studied integrated together by calculating the percentage
change under stress in specific hippocampal transcripts. This
analysis again showed increases in miR-132 in both the
predator scent (t test: p \ 0.01) and the AChE-R excess
models (p \ 0.01), but not in the footshock stress under
shAChE, which led to miR-132 decreases (p \ 0.05); an
accompanying decline in p250GAP in both models
(p \ 0.01 and p \ 0.05 for the predator scent and AChE-R
excess models, respectively) with miR-132 increases. In
addition, in all three models, the stress-inducible changes in
the hippocampal levels of miR-132 and its p250GAP and
AChE targets showed inverse patterns of individual variability. Thus, both predator-stressed C57BI/6J and the
chronically anxious TgR FVB/N mice showed larger interanimal hippocampal miR-132 variability compared to matched controls. Inversely, they both presented smaller
p250GAP variability under stress than in control mice
(Fig. 10, Online Resources Fig. 4), suggesting that miR-132
changes serve to mitigate p250GAP variability under stress
in these two models. In comparison, C57BI/6J mice subjected to shAChE knockdown predictably showed a tendency to reduce AChE levels (60–80% of control levels;
p \ 0.05), while p250GAP levels were elevated in this
model (p \ 0.5; Fig. 10). These findings are compatible
with the hypothesis that the inter-individual variability in
hippocampal miR-132 is inversely interlocked with that of

123

p250GAP. Our analysis thus attributes the observed stressinducible cholinergic hyper-excitation to the feed-forward
regulation of miR-132 and AChE transcripts, and shows that
avoiding p250GAP reduction and the corresponding breadth
of inter-individual variability in miR-132 associates with
stress-inducible cholinergic hyper excitation and cognitive
impairments (Fig. 10d).

Discussion
Using three different mouse stress models, we found longlasting stress-inducible enhancement of both the levels
and the individual variability in hippocampal miR-132

Brain Struct Funct

expression. This phenomenon was accompanied by the
suppression of the levels of hippocampal AChE and the
GTPase activator p250GAP, which are both validated
miR-132 targets. Knockdown of AChE production greatly
limited miR-132 increases in a footshock stress model,
suggesting continuous surveillance by cholinergic signaling
of miR-132 levels in the hippocampal which is disrupted
under psychological stress due to AChE over-production.
Suppressing AChE further prevented footshock stressinducible damages in cognition, but not anxiety, attributing
to miR-132 a regulatory role over post-stress cognition but
not anxiety. Corroborating this finding, engineered mice
with chronic excess of both miR-132 and engineered AChE
showed an anxiogenic-like phenotype, impaired locomotion and cognition, and cholinergic hyper-excitation when
exposed to pilocarpine. Of note, hippocampal AChE
mRNA levels remained elevated 7 days following predator
scent test and 14 days following footshock stress accompanied by chronic hippocampal lentiviral infection. In the
pre-frontal cortex, we found weeks-long elevation of AChE
following mild stress (Meshorer et al. 2005). In the hippocampus, we noted such elevation during 1 h and 1 day
post-stress (Kaufer et al. 1998, Nijholt et al. 2004). AChE
levels were normal in mice 14 days following footshock
stress alone thus indicates the transient nature of this stress
in the hippocampus.
In predator-stressed C57BI/6J mice and in FVB/N mice
with engineered over-expression of AChE, we found elevated inter-animal variability of hippocampal miR-132
levels which was accompanied by narrower variability of
its p250GAP target, suggesting causal links between miR132 and this neuronal protein. Given the in-bred features of
these mouse strains, we hypothesized that the stressinducible inter-animal variability in hippocampal miR-132
reflects life-long differences in individual experience
which mediate these changes. Reinforcing this notion,
personal experience determines much of the stress reactions in human patients with post-traumatic stress disorder
(Feder et al. 2009).
Both miR-132 and AChE transcription are controlled by
CREB (Shaked et al. 2009), which is notably involved in
learning and memory, neural growth and by the neuronal
growth factor BDNF associated with cholinergic functioning (Cogswell et al. 2008; Im et al. 2010; Wayman
et al. 2008). Correspondingly, individual differences in
response to chronic stress were recently attributed to hippocampal BDNF (Taliaz et al. 2011). Also, contextual fear
conditioning increases pri-miR-132 levels in the mouse
hippocampus (Ponomarev et al. 2010) and in the hippocampus of chronically-stressed rats (Meerson et al. 2010),
and the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine leads to a transient
up-regulation of pri- and mature-miR-132 (Nudelman et al.
2010). The observed pilocarpine and nicotine-inducible

(Salas et al. 2008) hyper-excitation in TgR mice is likely
due to the failure of miR-132 in these mice to suppress
AChE. This hypothesis is reinforced by the co-expression
of TgR AChE with the early immediate protein c-fos,
which is expressed in neurons whose activity is strongly
stimulated by synaptic input (Dragunow and Faull 1989;
Frankland et al. 2004). c-fos is also essential for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory (Fleischmann
et al. 2003) and represents part of the signal transduction
cascade underlying the molecular basis of long-term
potentiation (Miyamoto 2006), suggesting relevance for the
observed cognitive impairments in TgR mice. In stressed
wild type mice, however, activation of the AChE glucocorticoid-responsive element also takes place (Meshorer
and Soreq 2006). This might reduce ACh levels and consequently suppress CREB-inducible miR-132 transcription,
regaining homeostasis. Hippocampal miR-132 was not
up-regulated following stress when AChE-S was suppressed is compatible with proposed inter-locked regulation of these two stress-inducible genes (Fig. 10d).
Cre-lox mediated deletion of miR-132 in newborn
hippocampal neurons decreases dendrite length and
arborization in adult mice (Magill et al. 2010), supporting a
long-lasting role for miR-132 in neuronal differentiation,
synaptogenesis and maintenance. The GTPase activator
p250GAP emerges as an additional target of miR-132
which is involved in mediating the stress-inducible cognitive malfunctioning. Suppressing p250GAP in cultured
cortical neurons enhances neurite sprouting, similar to the
neurological reaction following stress (Kawashima et al.
2010). Both neuronal activity and the GABAA inhibitor
bicuculline induce miR-132 transcription, which further
down-regulates p250GAP and might enhance neurite
growth (Wayman et al. 2008). Also, miR-132 is up-regulated during post-natal development, when massive neurite
sprouting occurs; miR-132-targeted antisense oligonucleotides attenuate neurite growth (Ponomarev et al. 2010).
The reported link between p250GAP and the NMDA
receptor (Nakazawa et al. 2003) further supports a causal
role in the post-stress cognitive impairments for p250GAP
suppression. Likewise, engineered anti-sense suppression
of AChE modulates neuronal sprouting in the mouse hippocampus (Sklan et al. 2006). Our findings of miR-132
excess in the hippocampus of mature TgR mice and in
footshock-stressed mice over a month after the insult, and
7 days post-predator scent stress are compatible with the
hypothesis that the long-term dual suppression of AChE
and p250GAP in the hippocampus might serve as a compensatory mechanism to balance the damages associated
with excessive neuronal sprouting.
AChE suppression prevents both miR-132 increases and
the accompanying cognitive malfunctioning that suggests
the stress-associated changes in neurite sprouting is a

123

Brain Struct Funct

pivotal cause of these damages, and opens new venues for
treating trauma patients by mitigating irreversible changes
in their neuronal network. Nevertheless, our study did not
exclude the involvement of other experimentally validated
miR-132 targets. For example, the miR-132-targeted lightinduced transcription regulatory factor X 4 (RFX4),
abundant in the supra-chiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the
hypothalamus, regulates biological clocks and rhythms
(Alvarez-Saavedra et al. 2011; Cheng and Obrietan 2007).
In wild type mice, miR-132 levels are lower during the
dark part of the circadian cycle in the SCN (Cheng et al.
2007). The nocturnal locomotive fluctuations in the TgR
mice may therefore reflect circadian variations in ACh levels, (Erb et al. 2001) which lead to uncontrolled miR-132
and RFX4 levels. The miR-132/-212 cluster also targets the
Rett syndrome-related MeCP2 co-factor of the neuronal
transcription silencer REST (Klein et al. 2007). REST
binding to the regulatory huntingtin protein is impaired
during the progression of Huntington’s disease (Packer et al.
2008), suggesting parallel stress-associated effects. Inversely, rapid ischemic pre-conditioning, which protects the
brain from subsequent prolonged ischemia (Lusardi et al.
2010) is accompanied by miR-132 decreases and MeCP2
increases. MiR-132 also targets the fragile-X mental retardation protein FMRP, knockdown of which abolishes the
morphological effects of miR-132 transfection. This suggests competitive interaction between FMRP and p250GAP
which may balance out the miR-132-mediated effect on
neuronal sprouting (Wayman et al. 2008). In addition,
miR-132 is predicted to target several ion channels, and
might thus affect cell excitability; correspondingly, overexpressed pre-miR-132 potentiates glutamate, NMDA, or
K?-mediated depolarization of cultured neurons, suggesting
global involvement in regulating neurotransmission and
plasticity (Wibrand et al. 2010; Edbauer et al. 2010) which
may either be direct or function through p250GAP. The
multitude targets of neuronal-expressed miRs thus point at
combinatorial, rather than single miR-target relevance.
