Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with unknown etiology.
PD is commonly referred to as a “motor disease,” reflecting its clinical symptoms, including resting tremors of extremities, muscular
rigidity, shuffling gait, stoop posture, and
bradykinesia (1). The underlying pathology
of PD is progressive neuronal loss, particularly in the substantia nigra pars compacta
(SNc), and the presence of abnormal protein-rich aggregates—known as Lewy bodies—in the remaining neurons (2). The loss
of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc, leading

to dopamine deficiency, is believed to be responsible for the motor and nonmotor
symptoms, including orthostatic hypotension, mood disorders, sleep disorder, and
loss of sense of smell. Dopamine replacement therapy provides symptomatic relief,
but disease progression continues unabated.
Therefore, there is a need for understanding
the mechanisms of PD to aid the development of more effective therapeutics. This
endeavor is fueled by genetic discoveries in
the past two decades that identified a number
of genes associated with rare inheritable PD,

models built based on other proteins with known structures. The N-terminus region preceding the LRR domain
consists of sequence similarity to more than one additional protein–protein interaction domain, including HEAT
[Huntingtin, elongation factor 3 (EF3), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the yeast kinase TOR1] repeats and
Ankyrin repeats; however, their boundaries are more difficult to approximate. (B) A simplified drawing of the vesicular
endocytosis pathway showing GAK/Hsc70 involvement in uncoating clathrin-coated vesicles. BAG5 might also be
involved in the same process by interacting with Hsc70, and Rab7L1 functions in the retromer sorting process. LRRK2
interacts with all three proteins (GAK, BAG5, and Rab7L1); thus, the process of vesicular endocytosis, sorting,
recycling, and degradation might be important in the pathogenesis of PD.

including SNCA, Parkin/PRKN, DJ-1/Park7,
PINK1, and LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) (3). The push now is to understand
the functions of these gene products and
the biological pathways in which they operate. In PNAS, Beilina et al. identify a number
of LRRK2 interactors whose jobs are to process endocytosed vesicles, thereby associating LRRK2 with the vesicle endocytosis
pathways (4).
Mutation in LRRK2 is a common cause of
PD (5). LRRK2 is a large (2,527 amino acids)
multidomain protein consisting of at least
five putative domains (Fig. 1A) (6). The catalytic region consists of three of those domains:
A Ras-like GTPase domain called Ras of complex proteins (ROC) followed by a domain
called C-terminal of ROC (COR), which is
in turn followed by a kinase domain (Kinase). The mechanism of LRRK2 in PD
pathogenesis remains unclear; however, the
most common disease-associated mutation
in LRRK2, G2019S, shows higher kinase
activity than wild-type. Therefore, overactivation of LRRK2 kinase activity might be associated with disease pathogenesis (7). The
tandem ROC-COR-Kinase arrangement suggests that their activities might be coupled such
that the GTPase activity of ROC might modulate the kinase activity. Indeed, several studies
have shown that GTP binding to the ROC
domain regulates the activity of the Kinase
(8, 9). Moreover, PD-associated mutation in
the ROC domain (R1441C) has been shown
to have higher kinase activity (10), thus suggesting that mutations in the ROC domain
also up-regulate LRRK2’s kinase activity.
Flanking the catalytic tridomain region,
including about 1,300 residues upstream of
ROC and about 400 residues downstream of
the Kinase domain, are predicted to encode
protein–protein interaction domains, including
a leucine-rich repeat domain (LRR), a seven–
β-propeller structure called WD40, and likely
other protein–protein domains upstream of
the LRR domain. LRRK2 is equipped to perform multiple biochemical functions; in my
group, we refer to it as the “Swiss Army
Knife” protein. The presence of multiple protein–protein interaction domains in LRRK2

process is downstream of clathrin-uncoating
in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Fig. 1B);
thus, all three LRRK2 interactors identified by
Beilina et al. (4) fit in this common pathway.
It remains to be determined whether this
pathway plays a major role in the pathogenesis of PD; however, numerous lines of
evidence that have emerged over the past
two decades have implicated various areas of
vesicular trafficking, retromer sorting, lysosomal degradation, and autophagy in PD, as
well as other neurodegenerative diseases,
including Alzheimer’s disease, thus lending

support for a common pathway leading to
PD. An exciting aspect of Beilina et al.’s work
(4) is that it identifies specific players that
potentially unify these pathways. It was
hoped that studying the mechanisms of rare
familial PD might provide insights into the
etiology of sporadic PD. The data by Beilina
et al. support this notion in that the interactors of LRRK2, which is associated with
familial PD, overlaps with genes identified
in genome-wide association studies.
The mechanism of PD was virtually a
“black-box” only two decades ago. We now
know a handful of genes directly involved
in pathogenesis and the cellular pathways
in which they function are beginning to unravel. Much more work remains to be done
to understand the disease at depths required
for translation into therapeutic strategies. For
example: How do LRRK2 and other PDassociated proteins perturb vesicular processing and other cellular processes? What is
the molecular mechanisms of toxicity? What
are the functions of these PD-associated proteins and how are they altered by the diseaseassociated point mutations? The report by
Beilina et al. (4) paves the way for detailed
molecular and quantitative investigations
required to answer these questions.

suggests that it likely interacts with a number
of different proteins and perhaps functions in
a multiprotein complex. Therefore, knowing
the identity of its interactors could reveal the
cellular pathways in which it functions.
LRRK2 has been proposed to interact with
a number of different proteins, including the
14-3-3 family of proteins (11), microtubules
(12), dishevelled proteins (13), carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP)
(14), and mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase 6 (MKK6) (15). These proteins have
broad functions; thus, whether they cooperate
with LRRK2 in a common pathway is unclear.
To perform an unbiased screen for proteins that interact with LRRK2, Beilina et al.
(4) used protein–protein arrays with immobilized LRRK2. The authors found a number
of different interactors, including cyclin
G-associated kinase (GAK), three members
of the Bcl-2–associated anthanogene domain
cochaperones (BAG), and RAB7 member
RAS oncogene family-like1 (Rab7L1). An
exciting aspect of Beilina et al.’s findings
is that these LRRK2 interactors could function in the same cellular pathway, namely
the vesicle trafficking process (Fig. 1B).
Among the interactors identified by Beilina
et al. (4) are the following. GAK consists of
multiple domains, including a clathrin-binding domain, a kinase domain, and a J-domain
that interacts with heat-shock cognate 70
(Hsc70) (16). GAK and Hsc70 together power
the uncoating of endocytosed clathrin-coated
vesicles (17). Interestingly, GAK has been
implicated as a risk factor for PD in genomewide association studies (18). BAG5 is a
member of the BAG-family of proteins
known as cochaperones that interact with
Hsc70/Hsp70 and modulate their functions.
BAG proteins have been shown to interact
with the ATPase domain of Hsc70 and accelerate the exchange of ATP for ADP, acting
as a nucleotide-exchange factor. BAG5 might
modulate the activity of Hsc70/GAK complex by binding to the ATPase domain of
Hsc70. Interestingly, BAG5 has been previously shown to inhibit another PD-associated
protein, Parkin, and enhances dopaminergic
neuron degeneration (19). The third LRRK2
interactor identified by Beilina et al., Rab7L1,
has been shown to be a risk factor for PD
and was subsequently shown to interact with
