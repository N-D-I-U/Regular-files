Abstract:
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder characterized by selective degeneration of dopaminergic
neurons (DAergic) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and subsequent decrease in dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum.
Although levodopa replacement therapy is initially effective in symptomatic treatment of parkinsonian patients, its effectiveness
often declines and various levodopa-related side effects appear after long-term treatment. The disabling side effects of levodopa
therapy include motor fluctuations such as the wearing-off or on-off phenomena, dyskinesias and psychiatric symptoms. Nowadays,
DA receptor agonists are often regarded as first choice in de novo and young parkinsonian patients to delay the onset of levodopa
therapy. In advanced stages of the disease, they are also used as adjunct therapy together with levodopa to retard the development of
motor complications. DA receptor agonists mimick the endogenous neurotransmitter, dopamine, and act by direct stimulation of
presynaptic (autoreceptors) and postsynaptic DA receptors. Next to their clinical role in treating parkinsonian patients, laboratory
studies reported antioxidative and neuron-rescuing effects of DA receptor agonists either in vivo or in vitro. This may involve
reduced DA turnover following autoreceptor stimulation and direct free radical scavenging activity. In this review, we focus on and
summarize the recently reported effects of the most commonly used DA agonists either in clinical or in research studies relevant to
PD treatment.

Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common progressive
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by massive
depletion of striatal dopamine (DA) as a result of degeneration of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the
substantia nigra. Clinically, the disease is manifested
by bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity and disturPharmacological Reports, 2005, 57, 701712

bance of posture and gait [99]. To date, the etiopathogenesis of nigral DAergic neuron loss in PD is unclear. However, the presence of ongoing oxidative
stress as the result of inefficacious antioxidant defence mechanisms and generation of radical oxygen
species in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc)
of the parkinsonian brain are important pathogenic
mechanisms [2, 60, 142]. It should be noted that part
of these free radicals are inevitably produced by dopamine metabolism in the brain either enzymatically
through the action of monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B)
or by autooxidation [94]. Other sources of increased
radical production may be endogenous neurotoxins
occurring in the brain like tetrahydroisoquinolines or
exogenously administered neurotoxins like the widely
used herbicide paraquat which have similar neurochemical properties like the well-known neurotoxin,
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
[7, 96]. Moreover, Antkiewicz-Michaluk [7] suggested that PD could be associated with excitotoxicity
and apoptosis. Therefore, an effective anti-parkinsonian
therapy should not only alleviate the diseaseassociated symptoms, but should also interfere with
the progressive DAergic death in the substantia nigra.
The use of levodopa in PD
Treatment with levodopa

Since its introduction by Birkmayer and Hornykiewicz [15] levodopa remained the central pillar and
the most effective drug for the symptomatic treatment
of PD. Its prescription for parkinsonian patients is primarily based on its ability as a DA precursor to compensate for the decrease of DA in the brain. Although
the initial use of levodopa replacement therapy is effective in symptomatic treatment of PD, the clinical
efficacy often declines after long-term therapy and
additionally disabling side-effects appear, most notably motor fluctuation such as the wearing-off or onoff phenomena and dyskinesia [23, 34]. These motor
response complications appear in most patients with
advanced PD treated with levodopa [23]. The precise
mechanisms for the appearance of these treatmentrelated fluctuations are not clear. Nutt [91] reported
that the long-duration response that characterizes the
first few years of levodopa use in parkinsonian patients appeared to depend on the integrity of remaining DAergic nerve terminals in the striatum which retained the capacity to synthesize, release, reuptake

702

Pharmacological Reports, 2005, 57, 701712

and store newly synthesized DA. After long-term use
of levodopa and with progression of the disease, the
short-duration response to levodopa and appearance
of motor fluctuations are paralleled with more advanced DAergic denervation and loss of release and
reuptake capacity [80]. Nonphysiological pulsatile
stimulation of DA receptors seems to induce the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias
whereas a more continuous stimulation might be associated with less fluctuation [136].
Effect of levodopa on dopaminergic cells

However DA replacement therapy with levodopa is
successful to improve PD symptoms, it does not inhibit the progressive degeneration of DA neurons in
SN [66]. Levodopa is not only ineffective against
death of DAergic cells in PD patients, but there is also
serious concern about possible toxic actions of levodopa on the remaining DAergic neurons. It has been
reported that it was toxic to cultured DAergic neurons
[4, 21, 46, 74, 90]. On the other hand, there is some
evidence indicating that large doses of levodopa did
not induce DA neuron degeneration in humans or normal mice and rats [101, 105]. In parkinsonian patients, it was speculated that the remaining DAergic
neurons in the patient’s brain could be particularly
vulnerable to levodopa toxicity since they are hyperactive as a consequence of compensatory mechanisms
[143]. In contrast, Dziewczapolski et al. [32] and
Murer et al. [87] reported that treatment of rats with
different degree of nigrostriatal damage for 6 months
with oral levodopa was not toxic for the remaining
DAergic neurons. Even when levodopa administration is started during an active degenerative process of
DAergic neurons after intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine
(6-OHDA) treatment, no aggravation of toxicity was
found [40].
However, it is discussed that levodopa can enter
other DAergic neurons, particularly of the mesolimbic
pathway, which may result in psychotic symptoms
and mood disturbance in some patients [141].
Mechanisms underlying levodopa toxicity

It was reported that increasing oxidative stress via
autooxidation of levodopa plays an important role in
levodopa toxicity. Spina and Cohen [120] and Fahn
and Cohen [35] reported that the autooxidation and
metabolism of levodopa can give rise to potentially

Dopamine agonists and Parkinson’s disease

harmful free radical species, hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) and quinones. H2O2 played the most crucial
role in the cascade of oxidative events induced by DA
or levodopa towards SH-SY5Y cells [70]. Quinones
were suggested to be responsible in part for the degeneration of non-DAergic neurons [97]. Pardo et al.
[97] reported that the levels of quinones positively
correlated with the severity of cell death in human
neuroblastoma NB69 cells and at the same time the
damage of DA neurons took place early before the rising of quinones. In addition to generation of H2O2 and
quinone formation, levodopa-induced cell death may
result from induction of apoptosis as evidenced by the
increase in caspase-3 activity in Neuro-2A cells [100].
Taken together, levodopa-induced toxicity is related
primarily to DA production. Excessive dopamine metabolism by high-dose levodopa therapy may promote
oxidative stress and thereby accelerate the rate of neuronal degeneration either in vivo or in vitro. Interestingly, Muriel et al. [88, 89] observed that levodopa
treatment of control and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats altered the localization of the D1 DA receptor from the
plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. They also reported that this effect was probably the result of D1
DA receptor activation rather than that of DAergic
denervation as such changes were observed on the lesioned and unlesioned side of the striatum of 6OHDA-lesioned rats. The altered localization of D1
receptors may participate in the occurrence of the side
effects of levodopa therapy such as dyskinesia and
fluctuations in motor performance.
Dopamine receptors and dopamine receptor
agonists
Dopamine receptors

In brief, DA receptors belong to two classes of G
protein-coupled receptors, the D1 and D2 classes. The
classification of DA receptors was primarily based on
their effects on adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation
in the cells [63]. The D1 receptor subtypes promote,
whereas the D2 subtypes inhibit AC activity and
cAMP synthesis [84]. However, it has been reported
that the D2 receptors are mainly responsible for
modulating the activity of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ and
K+ channels [119]. Moreover, molecular cloning confirmed that D1 and D2 receptors constituted two different classes of DA subtypes. In mammals, two re-

ceptor subtypes have been assigned to the D1 receptor
class (D1A/D1 and D1B/D5), but other types (D1C and
D1D) exist in nonmammalian vertebrates [62] and similarly three types (D2, D3 and D4) of the D2 class have been
isolated [20]. DA receptor subtypes share similar sequences and structure [20]. Each type of DA receptors contains seven transmembrane domains with a unique binding
site formed by the external loops of the protein [115].
The D1 and D2 receptors constitute the major DA
receptor subtypes and they are differentially expressed in various regions of the human brain. The D1
receptors are the most widespread receptors and are
mainly expressed in the striatum, nucleus accumbens,
olfactory tubercle, cerebral cortex and amygdala. It
has also been detected in the island of Calleja and in
the subthalamic nucleus [57, 58, 127]. The D2 receptors are also mainly expressed in the striatum, nucleus
accumbens and olfactory tubercle, but additionally in
the SNpc and in the ventral tegmental area, where
they presumably function as autoreceptors [58, 117,
127]. In the SNpr, binding of D1-specific ligands was
demonstrated, but no mRNA was detected. Probably
D1 receptors are synthesized in the striatal neurons
that project to the substantia nigra [58, 127]. Generally, D1 receptors are mainly post-synaptic, while D2
receptors are found post- and pre-synaptically (autoreceptor function) [57]. Functionally, there is some
evidence that striatal D1 receptors are expressed selectively by medium spiny neurons projecting to the
globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) (direct pathway)
[43, 53], while D2 receptors are expressed by striatal
medium spiny neurons projecting to the globus pallitus pars externa (Gpe) (indirect pathway) [43, 53] as
well as by both striatal cholinergic interneurons and
dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons (autoreceptors)
[79, 85]. In accordance, occupation of D1 receptors by
DA or D1 receptor agonists stimulates AC activity and
stimulates the direct pathway. On the other hand, D2
receptor occupation by DA or D2 receptor agonists
suppresses AC activity and inhibits neurons projecting from the striatum to GPe [3].
The D5 receptor is localized in the SNpc, hypothalamus, striatum, cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle [64]. Also, it was reported
that the D5 receptor displayed higher affinity for DA
than the D1 subtype [49, 121]. The high affinity of the
D5 receptor for DA and its presence in the areas of DA
pathways suggests that the D5 receptor may participate in some activities of DAergic neurotransmission
[67].

Pharmacological Reports, 2005, 57, 701712

703

The D3 receptor is localized in the forebrain limbic
areas [119] and the largest receptor densities occur in
granule cells of the islands of Calleja and in mediumsized spiny neurons of the rostral and ventromedial
shell of the nucleus accumbens [29, 71]. D3 receptor
expression is low in the striatum. It is also expressed
in the ventral pallidum, SNpc, the ventral tegmental
area, mediodorsal thalamus, cerebral cortex, the cerebellum and amygdala in the rat brain [19, 29, 30].
There are some evident links between the alteration in
dopamine D3 receptor function and the etiology of
a variety of CNS disorders, including schizophrenia
and PD [75].
The D4 receptor level is low in the basal ganglia and
higher in the frontal cortex, medulla, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus and mesencephalon [57].
In the rat central nervous system, the relative abundance of the DA receptors is D1 > D2 > D3 > D5 > D4
[57].
Development of DA therapy with receptor agonists for treating PD

DA receptor agonists play an important role in antiparkinsonian therapy and have become increasingly
popular since the introduction of bromocriptine by
Donald Calne and colleagues in 1974 [41]. Their development aimed at reducing the disabling motor
complications produced by levodopa therapy [61].
More recently, DA receptor agonists are being used in
the initial treatment of patients with de novo PD either
as monotherapy or combined with low doses of levodopa [108]. Moreover, DA receptor agonists are advantageous in several aspects. They do not require
carrier-mediated transport in the gut or brain. They act
directly on the DA receptors without the need for
metabolic modification, release or storage. They also
have longer half-lives than levodopa and, therefore,
they produce more persistent DA receptor stimulation
than levodopa. Their metabolism does not generate
free radicals which are considered one of the most important hazards in levodopa treatment particularly on
DAegic neurons [46]. The most important DA receptor agonists which are currently approved and gained
access into the clinical and research studies are ergoline derivatives such as bromocriptine, lisuride, pergolide, cabergoline and a-dihydroergocriptine as well
as the non-ergoline derivatives like rotigotine,
pramipexole, ropinirole and apomorphine. Ergolines,
derivatives of ergot alkaloids, have a longer history in

704

Pharmacological Reports, 2005, 57, 701712

anti-parkinsonian therapy and are as effective as nonergolines, which were developed in the hope that they
might provide the benefits of the ergoline agents without their side effects [17]. However, recently valvular
heart disease was presented as a new complication of
ergot derivative DA receptor agonists [55, 107, 118,
133] but non-ergot DA receptor agonists cannot be
excluded at present due to lack of sufficient reliable
pharmacoepidemiological data [24]. Partly, the individual DA receptor agonists show significant variation in their receptor affinity [44].
General effects of DA receptor agonists

DA receptor agonists are initially prescribed at the
early stage of parkinsonism to postpone the onset of
levodopa therapy. They are co-administered with low
doses of levodopa to delay the development and to
minimize the severity of levodopa-associated treatment complications [12, 110]. There is great evidence
that stimulation of D2 receptors at the post-synaptic
level is primarily involved in alleviating levodopainduced motor fluctuations. Additionally, direct receptor activation with an agonist might be expected to
elicit more specific and controllable effects than those
produced by the transmitter precursor levodopa, in
patients with a damaged extrapyramidal system [41].
More recently, there is increasing evidence in the literature that DA agonists are not only beneficial to
postpone levodopa therapy in early parkinsonism or
to counteracting its complications after long-term use
but they have also been suggested to be neuroprotective particularly in experimental models [72, 103].
The mechanisms and processes underlying the neuroprotective actions of DA receptor agonists appear to
be interlaced. They spare levodopa, thereby reducing
the formation of oxidative radicals from levodopa metabolism, act as radical scavengers, reduce DA synthesis, release and metabolism via activating presynaptic autoreceptors, ameliorate excitotoxicity by
suppressing subthalamic nucleus overactivity and exert antiapoptotic effects [113].
Interestingly, DA receptor agonists have been reported to play an important neurogenic modulatory
role in the central nervous system (CNS) development
[129]. In line with this, Höglinger et al. [54] observed
that experimental depletion of dopamine in rodents
decreased precursor cell proliferation in both subependymal and subgranular zones in the adult. The
highly proliferative precursors in subependymal zone

Dopamine agonists and Parkinson’s disease

express DA receptors and receive DAergic afferents.
More specifically, DA D3 receptor mRNA expression
in CNS occurs quite early in development and is predominantly found in the proliferative neuroepithelium
[31]. In addition to in vivo reports, in vitro studies
have shown that DA increased 3H thymidine incorporation (a marker of cell proliferation) in a neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid cell line transfected with the
human D3 receptor [102]. In contrast to the involvement of D3 receptor early in neurogenesis, D2 and D1
receptor mRNAs occur later in the development and
appear predominantly in migrating and differentiating
neurons [31]. Moreover, in neurosphere cultures prepared from neural precursors in the adult subependymal zone, activation of dopamine D2-like receptors
directly increased the proliferation of these precursors
[54].
Ergoline DA receptor agonists
Bromocriptine

Bromocriptine is the first DA receptor agonist that has
been approved for anti-parkinsonian therapy since
1974 [41]. It was first used as adjunct therapy to levodopa in patients experiencing motor fluctuations and
later was recommended as monotherapy in the early
stage of the disease [134]. Bromocriptine has been
shown to protect mice and DAergic cells against
6-OHDA and MPTP, and levodopa-induced cell loss,
respectively. It also attenuated DA depletion in mouse
striatum in response to methamphetamine [68, 92,
122]. The neuroprotective effect of bromocriptine is
dependent on both, its action as a D2 receptor agonist
and its antioxidant capacity. In this context, it has
been reported that bromocriptine is able to scavenge
hydroxyl and superoxide radicals in vitro [92, 138]
and to inhibit hydroxyl radical formation and lipid
peroxidation in vivo [92].
Pergolide

Pergolide, a semi-synthetic ergoline derivative, is
a potent DA receptor agonist used as adjunct to levodopa therapy to slow the clinical progression of PD or
to prevent the levodopa-associated motor complications [47, 59]. However, its clinical use is already of
minor importance now, since it was recently shown to
be associated with the development of restrictive valvular heart disease [10, 55, 128]. Pergolide is ab-

sorbed rapidly following oral dosing reaching peak
plasma concentration within 2–3 h, has a long halflife of about 21 h and is completely eliminated within
4–5 days [16]. Accordingly, it should produce a more
physiological and continuous stimulation of DA receptors avoiding or delaying the induction of dyskinesia [16]. The neuroprotective effect of pergolide has
been observed either in vivo or in vitro. For instance,
chronic administration of pergolide preserved the integrity of nigrostriatal neurons in the aging rat’s brain
[38] and protected against reduction of striatal DA
and its metabolites after 6-OHDA injection in mice
[9]. Using cell culture models, pergolide has been
shown to promote the survival of DAergic neurons, to
exhibit partial protection against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+) toxicity and to increase
3H-dopamine uptake by cultured cells after levodopa
treatment [46]. Moreover, pergolide had protective effect against H2O2 in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells
[126]. The neuroprotective effect of pergolide has
been shown to be mediated by free radical scavenging
activity particularly hydroxyl radicals and nitric oxide
and by decreasing phospholipid peroxidation [48, 95],
suppressing apoptotic pathways through inhibiting of
NF-kB nuclear translocation [125] and stabilizing the
mitochondrial function [46]. In clinical trials pergolide was shown to reduce the long-term decline of
striatal fluorodopa uptake compared to levodopa
treatment, however, without reaching significance
[116].
a-Dihydroergocriptine

a-Dihydroergocriptine is a synthetic hydrogenated ergot derivative with a strong dopamino-mimetic activity in vivo and in vitro [104]. It showed high efficacy
and tolerance in treatment of PD [12, 13, 18, 77, 83]
and revised PD-like symptoms in experimental models [27]. It was shown that a-dihydroergocriptine reduced abnormal motor behavior and neuronal degeneration induced by MPTP in monkeys [14], protected
mice against convulsions induced by intracerebroventricular injection of glutamate and incresed the survival time in mice submitted to total cerebral ischemia
induced by MgCl2 [27]. In cellular models, a-dihydroergocriptine protected cultured rat cerebral granule
cells against age-dependent and glutamate-induced
neuronal cell death [37] and increased the survival of
primary cultured DAergic cells when co-administered
with either levodopa or DA [45]. The neuroprotective
Pharmacological Reports, 2005, 57, 701712

705

activity of a-dihydroergocriptine may be based on activation of dopamine D2 receptors, interaction with
excitatory amino acids, influencing the glutathione redox index, improving of cellular energy metabolism,
decreasing of lipoperoxidative cellular degeneration,
radical scavenging activity, and enhancement of antioxidant enzymes [27, 36, 45, 78]. Moreover, a-dihydroergocriptine increased the number of astrocytes in
monkeys after MPTP treatment. Astrocyte activation
is important for restoration of neuronal function by
enhancing neuronal survival and axon growth in injured areas [86].
Cabergoline

Cabergoline, an ergoline DA receptor agonist, has
a relatively long average elimination half-life of
65–110 h as estimated by data on urinary excretion
rates in healthy volunteers and in parkinsonian patients, compared with other DA receptor agonists
[137]. It was reported that cabergoline is well tolerated and effective in controlling parkinsonism particularly in the early stage of the disease. When combined with levodopa therapy, it was highly effective in
improving motor disability without inducing hyperactivity or dyskinesia in cynomolgus monkeys [8]. Like
other ergot derivative DA receptor agonists, cabergoline showed neuroprotective potential. It was reported
that cabergoline protected nigrostriatal DAergic neurons against 6-OHDA in mice [139]. Activation of
GSH, catalase, superoxide dismutase, direct free radical scavenging activity and stimulation of neurotrophic factors are important in mediating the neuroprotective action of cabergoline [93, 139].
Non-ergoline dopamine receptor agonists
Pramipexole

Pramipexole, a synthetic amino-benzothiazole derivative, has a potent agonist activity for D2 and D3 receptors [81, 82]. The rank order of receptor affinity of
pramipexole within the D2 subfamily is D3 > D2 according to saturation binding experiments [44]. On
the other hand, pramipexole is lacking affinity for DA
D1 and D5 receptors [67].
Clinically, it was reported that the safety profile of
pramipexole is similar to that of the ergot-derived
compounds and it was effective as monotherapy in
early parkinsonism and as adjunct therapy with levo-

706

Pharmacological Reports, 2005, 57, 701712

dopa in advanced stages of the disease [109].
Pramipexole has been found to slow the rate of loss of
striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) density as measured in PD patients with the single photon emission
computed tomography ligand 123Ib-carbomethoxy3b(4-iodophenyltropane) [76, 98]. Furthermore, there
are some clinical trials suggesting that pramipexole
not only ameliorated motor symptoms, but also the
depressive symptoms in PD [109].
Beside the effective role of pramipexole in treating
parkinsonian symptoms, it showed a variety of neuroprotective effects in in vivo and in vitro experimental
paradigms [6, 22, 39, 73, 132]. For example, pramipexole inhibited the depletion of striatal DA content in
mice [106] and after MPTP treatment. In in vitro systems, it has been shown that pramipexole increased
the survival of rat mesencephalic cells exposed to
levodopa [21], protected SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma
cells against MPP+ and rotenone [51] and rescued
cerebellar granule cells from levodopa toxicity [131].
The neuroprotective effect of pramipexole seemed to
be derived from different mechanisms. Several reports claimed that the neuroprotective effects of
pramipexole are the result of the antioxidant properties [39, 73, 130, 144], inhibition of apoptotic pathways [1, 22, 65] and induction of neurotrophic factors
[67]. Moreover, Carvey et al. [21] suggested that the
neuroprotective effect of pramipexole may be mediated, in part, by interaction with the D3 receptor. This
hypothesis was further investigated in vivo by
Ramirez et al. [106]. They reported that pramipexole
was apparently less effective in inhibiting striatal DA
depletion as a result of MPTP treatment in D3 receptor
knockout mice than in mice expressing the receptor.
Moreover, the D3 receptor antagonist, A-437203, was
found to partially inhibit the protective effect of
pramipexole against MPTP-induced striatal DA. Conclusively, D3 receptor-dependent and -independent
mechanisms seem to play a role against MPTP toxicity in this model.
Ropinirole

Ropinirole is a non-ergoline DA receptor agonist that
exhibits a high affinity for the D2 and D3 receptors but
little or no affinity for the D1 receptor [25, 33].
Ropinirole is rapidly absorbed and well tolerated after
oral administration [69]. Symptomatically, it was reported that ropinirole was as effective as bromocriptine in reducing motor complications and decreas-

ing levodopa dose without increasing adverse events
including dyskinesia [26]. Also, ropinirole monotherapy was effective in treating resting tremor in early
PD [114], in reducing periodic leg movements and in
improving sleep efficiency in patients with restless
legs syndrome [5, 25]. These positive effects of
ropinirole in PD are believed to be due to stimulation
of the post-synaptic dopamine D2-type receptor [33].
In experimental models for PD, it has been found that
ropinirole reversed the motor and behavioral deficits
induced by MPTP in marmosets [33] and showed neuroprotective effect against 6-OHDA in mice [56]. Activation of GSH and GSH-regulating enzymes such as
glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and glutathione transferase as well as activation of catalase
and superoxide dismutase were principal neuroprotective mechanisms mediated by ropinirole [123]. In
clinical trials ropinirole reduced the long-term decline
of striatal fluorodopa uptake compared to levodopa
therapy indicating a preserving effect on terminal
function of DAergic neurons [135].
Apomorphine

Apomorphine, a non-ergoline DA receptor agonist, is
a short-acting and non-selective dopamine D1/D2 receptor agonist [28]. It was the first DA receptor agonist used for treating PD [28]. It has been recently reported that subcutaneous intermittent injections or
continuous infusions of apomorphine are currently
used for the management of sudden, unexpected and
refractory levodopa-induced “off” states in fluctuating PD [28]. Like other DA receptor agonists, there is
some evidence in the literature describing the neuroprotective potential of apomorphine in experimental
models. It has been shown that apomorphine exhibited neuroprotection against DA depletion in 6-OHDA
lesioned-rats [142] and MPTP-treated mice [50]. Furthermore, Battaglia et al. [11] and Yuan et al. [142] reported that continuous subcutaneous infusion of apomorphine rescued striatal DAergic terminals and increased the TH and DAT immunoreactivity against
toxicity induced by MPTP in mice and enhanced the
number of TH+ cells in the ventral tegmental area in
partially 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, respectively. It has
been observed that apomorphine increased the survival of cultured mesencephalic DAergic cells [52].
These findings provided an evidence for trophic effects of apomorphine either in vivo or in vitro. The
neuroprotective effect of apomorphine could be

a consequence of antioxidant activity [42, 112], potent
iron chelating action [124], inhibition of lipid peroxidation [140], induction of neurotrophic factors [111]
and anti-inflammatory effects [50].

Concluding remarks
Since the introduction of bromocriptine in 1974, great
attention has been paid to DA receptor agonists for
treating PD. They are successfully used in the initial
treatment of patients with de novo PD either as monotherapy or combined with low doses of levodopa. The
beneficial effects of DA receptor agonists as antiparkinsonian drugs is based on their ability to produce
direct and continuous stimulation of both presynaptic
(autoreceptors) and postsynaptic DA receptors. More
recently, DA receptor agonists have been shown to
produce neuroprotective activites in experimental
models either in vivo or in vitro. However, there is
shortage in the literature concerning the neuroprotective role of DA receptor agonists in parkinsonian patients as there is no objective method to check thoroughly for DAergic cell death. Taken together, we can
say that there is no drug that has been unequivocally
proven to be neuroprotective in the parkinsonian patient until now. On the other hand, DA receptor agonists are promising in this respect and ongoing research with more accurate neuroimaging devices
should decrease the distance between the data obtained from experimental models and clinical studies.
