Injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) into the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) offers a means to achieve widespread transgene delivery
to the central nervous system, where the doses can be readily translated from small to large animals. In contrast to studies with
other serotypes (AAV2, AAV4 and AAV5) in rodents, we report that a naturally occurring capsid (AAV9) and rationally engineered
capsid (AAV2.5) are able to achieve broad transduction throughout the brain and spinal cord parenchyma following a single
injection into the CSF (via cisterna magna or lumbar cistern) in non-human primates (NHP). Using either vector at a dose of
B2  1012 vector genome (vg) per 3–6 kg animal, approximately 2% of the entire brain and spinal cord was transduced, covering all
regions of the central nervous system (CNS). AAV9 in particular displayed efﬁcient transduction of spinal cord motor neurons.
The peripheral organ biodistribution was highly reduced compared with intravascular delivery, and the presence of circulating
anti-AAV-neutralizing antibodies up to a 1:128 titer had no inhibitory effect on CNS gene transfer. Intra-CSF delivery effectively
translates from rodents to NHPs, which provides encouragement for the use of this approach in humans to treat motor neuron
and lysosomal storage diseases.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, the adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 9 capsid was
identiﬁed as a vector capable of transducing neurons and glia
throughout the central nervous system (CNS) following intravenous delivery in adult rodents, cats and non-human primates
(NHPs).1–5 However, the translational feasibility of an intravascular
delivery approach for CNS disorders is problematic owing to the
high doses required, high biodistribution to peripheral tissues,
reduced efﬁciency for CNS transduction in NHPs and strong
inhibition by low levels of circulating anti-AAV9-neutralizing
antibodies (NAbs).3 Intracerebroventricular injection of AAV into
the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) has been used as an alternative
approach to transduce the brain, but previously tested AAV
serotypes (2, 4 and 5) are not able to penetrate efﬁciently into the
brain parenchyma and transduce neurons without adjuvants such
as mannitol; instead, AAV 4 and 5 efﬁciently transduce the
ependymal cells that line the ventricles.6–8
Intrathecal injection into the lumbar cistern or injection into the
cisterna magna has been used as an alternative approach to
deliver AAV to the central and peripheral nervous systems via the
CSF. Although these studies have been conducted in rodents with
AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV5, AAV6, AAV8 and AAV9, the primary
focus has been on spinal cord and/or dorsal root ganglia (DRG)
transduction. Conversely, in rodents intrathecal AAV delivery
produces only minimal brain transduction.9–14 For AAV9,
transduction of the spinal cord in mice was reportedly efﬁcient
but mostly limited to the lower thoracic and lumbar spinal cord.13
In contrast, when pigs received intrathecal injection of AAV9, the
transduction pattern could be diffusely spread across the entire
spinal cord if a catheter was used to inject the vector into the CSF

directly at the cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions.15 Interestingly
and in contrast to the results in mice, in pigs there was a high
degree of brain transduction present regardless of whether the
vector was injected diffusely across the spinal cord or just in the
lumbar cistern (S Gray, unpublished observation). Very recently,
Samaranch et al.5 reported that injection of AAV9 into the cisterna
magna of NHPs resulted in widespread brain transduction similar
to intravascular delivery. These studies suggest that injection into
CSF allows diffuse delivery to large areas of the brain and spinal
cord where the doses can be realistically scaled to larger animals
and humans.
In this study, we sought to explore the translational potential of
intra-CSF delivery of AAV for spinal cord and brain transduction.
Based on previously published results5,13,15,16 and those presented
here, AAV2.5 and AAV9 are capable of intraparenchymal neuronal
transduction following intra-CSF delivery. AAV9 and AAV2.5 were
compared 4 weeks following injection into the cisterna magna in
NHPs, and then compared with AAV9 injected into the lumbar
intrathecal space. We assessed variables critical for the translation of
this approach to humans, including the efﬁciency of brain and spinal
cord transduction, dose response, biodistribution to peripheral
organs and evasion of naturally occurring NAbs to the vector.
RESULTS
AAV2.5 is an engineered version of AAV2 that allows transduction
of neurons in the brain parenchyma following intra-CSF injection
Following injection of AAV vectors into the ventricles of the brain,
natural serotypes of AAV have only been successful at transducing
ependymal cells lining the ventricles rather than neurons within

the brain parenchyma.6 AAV2.5 is a hybrid of AAV2 and AAV1,
incorporating six amino acids from AAV1 into the AAV2 capsid.17
These mutations confer enhanced muscle tropism to AAV2.5, and
this capsid was used in a clinical trial for Duchenne’s muscular
dystrophy.17 AAV2.5 (10 ml, 6.6  1010 vector genome (vg)) was
injected into the anterior portion of the right lateral ventricle of
adult rats to investigate the potential to transduce neurons
following intra-CSF administration. After 2 weeks, the rats were
perfused, and tissue sections were taken through the entire
rostral–caudal extent of the brain for immunohistochemistry (IHC)
and immunoﬂuorescence. As seen in Figure 1, substantial
transduction was found in the hypothalamus along the extent
of the third ventricle, as well as in the central gray surrounding the
Sylvian aqueduct. Furthermore, extensive transduction was found
in the subcommissural organ, located within the dorsal third
ventricle (Supplementary Figure 1), whereas some green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)-positive vestibular neurons were found near
the fourth ventricle. Importantly, in our previous unpublished
studies, this ability to transduce distal structures along the
ventricular system was not seen with AAV2, AAV5 or AAV9 (for
AAV9, see Supplementary Figure 2).
Injection of AAV9 or AAV2.5 into the cisterna magna of NHPs
results in widespread transduction of the entire brain and spinal
cord
AAV2.5 showed a unique characteristic that separates it from
known naturally occurring AAV capsids, namely, it can cross the
ependymal cell barrier and transduce neurons in the CNS
following intra-CSF delivery. In our previous studies, AAV9 showed
superior ability in transducing the spinal cord following intrathecal
delivery in mice and pigs (Supplementary Figure 3 and Snyder
et al.13 Federici et al.15). To compare the potential value of these
vectors for gene delivery in human applications, we evaluated
AAV2.5 and AAV9 in cynomolgus monkeys, when injected into the
CSF of the cisterna magna. Table 1 provides a summary of all the
NHPs used in this study. Two NHPs were injected with selfcomplementary recombinant AAV (scAAV)2.5 (2  1012 vg) and
two with scAAV9 (1.83  1012 vg) in 1.5 ml of phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) containing 5% sorbitol. For direct comparison of the
intracisternal versus intrathecal routes, two additional animals
were injected via the lumbar cistern with scAAV9 (1.83  1012 vg in
1 ml). After 4 weeks, the animals were killed. Serum samples were
analyzed for the prevalence of NAbs against the injected capsid, at
the time of injection and at the time of sacriﬁce (Table 2). All
animals showed a rise in NAbs of the injected serotype after
4 weeks. After 4 weeks, two animals (101 injected with AAV9 and

104 injected with AAV2.5) produced NAbs against the other
serotype, while two animals (102 and 103) did not. The native GFP
ﬂuorescence signal was not reliably or readily detectable, thus IHC
was used to enhance the signal. GFP expression in the brain,
spinal cord and DRG was visualized and quantiﬁed by IHC, and
vector biodistribution throughout the spinal cord and major
peripheral organs was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR) (Figure 2). The speciﬁcity of the IHC was validated
by performing parallel IHC on uninjected NHP samples, on the
injected NHP samples without addition of the primary anti-GFP
antibody and on injected versus uninjected rat brains
(Supplementary Figure 4). The location of the coronal sections
portrayed in Figure 2 is shown in Supplementary Figure 5. For the
most part, AAV2.5 and AAV9 performed in a roughly equivalent
manner throughout the brain and spinal cord, transducing a
similar amount of tissue. The biodistribution data favored AAV2.5,
which had approximately a 100-fold lower distribution to the
spleen compared with AAV9. Both animals injected with AAV2.5
had pre-existing NAbs against the AAV2.5 capsid (1:8 and 1:128);
therefore, this could have affected the biodistribution of the
vector to peripheral organs.
The two NHPs injected via the lumbar cistern, for the most part,
were comparable to those receiving an intracisternal injection.
However, unlike the pattern seen following intracisternal injection,
the DRG were highly transduced with approximately 15–20% of
the area positive for GFP expression.

best vector, so we conducted further tests on AAV9 in NHPs to
determine the translational feasibility of its use as a gene therapy
vector. To test the efﬁcacy of intrathecal gene transfer (relative to
intracisternal) in a NHP model, six cynomolgus monkeys were
injected with 1.83  1012 vg of scAAV9/GFP vectors in 1 ml of
1  PBS containing 5% sorbitol. To investigate a possible dose–
response relationship, an additional two animals were injected
with 5.5  1012 vg of the same vector, in 1 ml of PBS containing 5%
sorbitol. All animals were prescreened for NAbs against AAV9, and
two of the ‘low-dose’ animals were speciﬁcally selected because
they had naturally occurring NAb titers of 1:32 and 1:128 (Table 2).
The animals were killed after 4 weeks. Serum samples were
analyzed for prevalence of NAbs against the injected capsid at the
time of injection and at the time of sacriﬁce. Two of the animals
had tested negative for NAbs in the prescreen 2 months before
injection, but had (1:4 and 1:8) titers of NAbs at the time of
injection. CSF was collected from the cisterna magna at the time
of injection, 2 h post-injection and at the time of sacriﬁce to check
for neutralizing factors in the CSF before and after injection, as
well as to assess the persistence of the vector at 2 h post-injection
(Table 2). We found that at pre- and post-injection time points, the
CSF did not contain any factors that inhibited AAV transduction,
except in one animal at the 4-week time point (1:4 dilution). This
animal (202) had the highest pre-existing NAb titer (1:128) and an
even higher titer (1:1024) at 4 weeks following injection. NHP 202
had a low but detectable amount of NHP DNA in the 4-week CSF
sample, indicating some blood contamination of the collected
CSF, which could explain the presence of NAbs in the CSF (see
Supplementary Table 1). All animals examined had virtually no
vector remaining in circulation in the CSF at 2 h post-injection, at
least in the cisterna magna (Table 2).
GFP expression in the brain, spinal cord and DRG was visualized
and quantiﬁed by IHC, and vector biodistribution throughout the
brain, spinal cord, DRG and major peripheral organs was assessed
by qPCR. For most of the animals (three low-dose NAb þ , one lowdose NAb  , two high-dose), IHC was performed on the liver and
spleen to assess vector expression in these peripheral organs. To
compare broadly how the experimental variables affected gene
expression in an unbiased and quantitative manner, anti-GFP IHC
was carried out on 5–7 mm sections from all samples and
subjected to automated morphometric analysis to assess gene
expression throughout the brain, spinal cord, DRG, optic nerve,
liver and spleen (Figure 3a and Supplementary Table 2, locations
of coronal sections shown in Supplementary Figure 6). Both the
gray and white matter showed expression of GFP that was not
evident in sections prepared in parallel without the primary antiGFP antibody or on naı̈ve tissue (Supplementary Figure 4). The
percent area of each slice that is GFP positive does not necessarily
correlate to the percentage of cells transduced. In all, we found no
difference in the distribution of CNS or peripheral organ GFP
expression between any groups, regardless of the presence of
anti-AAV9 NAbs or the vector dose. The distribution of GFP
expression was fairly even across the entire brain and spinal cord,
with an average value of approximately 2% of the area positive for
GFP in any given region of the CNS. The vector DNA biodistribution mostly followed the same pattern as GFP expression, with a
few notable exceptions (Figure 3b). The spinal cord had more
vector genomes than the brain, and these levels were comparable
to the DRG, except in the high-dose group where the DRG were at
least 10-fold higher. When compared with intravascular delivery of
AAV9,3 intrathecal delivery resulted in a much lower proportion of
vector genomes in peripheral organs compared with the CNS.
Although high levels of vector genomes were detected in the liver,
the presence of vector genomes did not correlate with a large
portion of the liver being positive for GFP expression. Similarly,
although over 50 times more vector genomes were detected in
the spleen than the brain, only approximately 2–5% of the
spleen was positive for GFP expression. Interestingly, the presence
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

of pre-existing AAV9 NAbs did not correlate with lower
biodistribution to peripheral organs.
To illustrate how the ‘percent of area GFP positive’ correlates to
the percentage of positive cells, sample images of those used for
the quantitative IHC portrayed in Figure 3a are provided in
Figure 4 (spinal cord, DRG, liver and spleen) and Figure 5 (brain).
Manual counting of GFP-positive versus -negative cells was carried
out across animals 201–206, focusing on speciﬁc brain and spinal
cord structures, and this information is provided in Table 3 with
representative photographs of each region provided in
Supplementary Figure 7. Although there were modest differences
in the overall transduction efﬁciency of speciﬁc brain structures, all
areas were transduced regardless of their proximity to the CSF.
In the ventral horn of the spinal cord, an abundance of large
diameter (25–50 mm) cells were GFP-positive, indicating efﬁcient
transduction of motor neurons. This is conﬁrmed by the
colocalization of GFP and ChAT seen in Supplementary Figure 8.
Consistent with previous reports,5 we observed transduction of
both neurons and astrocytes throughout the brain and spinal cord
(Supplementary Figures 9 and 10). A similar degree of spread
throughout the brain parenchyma, along with transduction of
neurons and glia, was observed in mice (Supplementary Figure 3).
Interestingly, in some sections, we captured part of the choroid
plexus within the lateral ventricle (Figure 6). The choroid plexus
was very strongly GFP positive, in stark contrast to the lack of GFP
expression in the ependymal cells that line the ventricles.
DISCUSSION
Based on our results, we conclude that intra-CSF administration of
AAV9 or AAV2.5 vectors (via lumbar cistern or cisterna magna)
offers a viable, translational option for global CNS gene delivery.
Importantly, these studies appear to have a marked improvement
in overcoming previously identiﬁed translational barriers, such as
inhibition by pre-existing NAbs, high peripheral organ biodistribution, reduced efﬁciency of CNS transduction in NHPs compared
with rodents and high dosage requirement3). It should be noted,
however, that intrathecal administration, especially for AAV9, did
not completely restrict the vector within the CNS. The additional
success of AAV2.5 in this approach also demonstrates the ability to
engineer rationally improved functionality into the AAV capsid for
novel clinical applications. If very high titers of NAbs can inhibit
the transduction of AAV9 after intra-CSF delivery, as the results of
Samaranch et al.5 suggest, the availability of two distinct AAV
serotypes capable of widespread CNS transduction would allow
treatment of patients with high levels of NAbs against one of
these serotypes (but not both). Two out of four animals showed a
lack of NAb cross-presentation between AAV2.5 and AAV9
(Table 2), suggesting the possibility of a second administration
of vector in some populations if the serotype capsid was switched
on the second administration.
Evasion of anti-AAV NAbs is an important consideration for any
translational approach, as an estimated 33.5% of the human
population are seropositive for AAV9.18 In this study and others,
we have screened a total of 35 randomly selected naı̈ve NHPs for
anti-AAV9 NAbs, and the highest titer detected was 1:128.
Although Samaranch et al.5 reported that anti-AAV9 serum NAb
titers X1:200 inhibited CNS gene transfer when AAV9 was
injected via the cisterna magna, in the present studies we found
that anti-AAV serum NAb titers up to 1:128 had no inhibitory effect
on successful CNS gene transfer. No inhibitory factors were
identiﬁed in the CSF before vector delivery or at 4 weeks postinjection, even when post-injection serum NAb titers rose as high
as 1:2048. Previously, we found that a 1:4 NAb titer was sufﬁcient
to inhibit completely AAV9 transduction of the CNS and peripheral
organs if an intravascular route of administration was used.3
Although the results of Samaranch et al.5 indicate that high serum
NAb titers can negatively inﬂuence intra-CSF gene transfer, our

results clearly show that lower NAb titers (that would block
intravascular gene delivery) are well tolerated. Moreover, our
limited survey of pre-existing NAb levels in NHP would suggest
that the presence of naturally occurring NAbs at levels inhibitory
to intra-CSF vector administration would be rare. The methods of
titering the NAbs were different in these studies, so we cannot
comment on what level of NAb would be inhibitory in relation to
our study.
This NHP study yielded some notable differences compared
with previous intrathecal AAV9 delivery studies in mice and
pigs.13,15 In pigs, the vector distribution was mostly limited to the
lumbar spinal cord, unless a catheter was manipulated to
physically distribute the vector to the cervical and thoracic
regions. However, in NHPs, a single bolus injection at the lumbar
region provided a relatively even level of transduction to the
entire spinal cord and brain. Although no clear explanation exists,
differences in size, anatomy and species must be considered. For
example, unlike humans and monkeys, the pig epidural space
contains fatty deposits that may restrict CSF ﬂow.19 In pigs, the
biodistribution to peripheral organs was barely detectable,
whereas in NHPs the vector was detected in the liver and
spleen at levels that equaled or exceeded levels seen in the CNS.
Also, the CSF and CNS volumes across species and age does not
always correlate with overall body size, so comparing ‘equivalent’
Gene Therapy (2013) 450 – 459

doses across species becomes a matter of which metric is used for
scaling. In our case, we utilized CSF volume as our comparative
metric, assuming equivalent CSF volumes of 0.035 ml in mice,
0.09 ml in rats, 20 ml in pigs, 12–15 ml in NHPs and 140 ml in
humans.20–22 In this case, the high dose in the referenced pig
study (B1.5  1011 vg per ml of CSF)15 is equivalent to the low
dose used in this study in NHPs (B1.5  1011 vg per ml of CSF).
Again, it is unclear whether the increased peripheral
biodistribution in NHPs compared with pigs is the result of
physiological/anatomical differences, differential receptor biology
and binding kinetics of AAV9, or differences in the injection
protocol that could have led to vector leakage. Previous studies
have indicated that intrathecal delivery in mice may restrict the
vector to the lower spinal cord, although these studies were
carried out with a lower AAV titer.23 However, our present results
show a similarity in the CNS and peripheral biodistribution
between mice and NHPs receiving intrathecal injections at
equivalent doses (scaled by CSF volume), including transduction
throughout the brain (Supplementary Figure 3). The roughly
equivalent translation of the intrathecal approach between mice
and NHPs is in contrast to an intravenous approach, which works
considerably better in mice than NHPs.3
A confusing observation from our rodent studies was the lack of
widespread transduction following intraventricular injection of

intrathecal injection of scAAV9/CBh-GFP vector, 5–7 mm sections from the spinal cord and DRG were subjected to IHC against GFP. Shown are

vector, whereas injections into the lumbar cistern produced
widespread CNS transduction (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3). As
CSF ﬂows in the direction from the lateral ventricles to the lumbar
cistern, it was not clear why the lateral ventricle injection did not
work. A possible explanation is that AAV9 has a very high afﬁnity
for the ependymal cells of the choroid plexus, supported by the
very strong transduction of this structure that we observed in the
NHPs (Figure 6). Injection into the lumbar cistern allows the vector
to circulate in the CSF before contacting the choroid plexus,
whereas injection into the ventricles would concentrate the AAV9
vector around those cells from the moment of injection.
Transduction of the choroid plexus itself could be beneﬁcial in
certain therapeutic applications, as these cells would be ideal
‘factories’ to secrete factors into the CSF. However, the turnover of
these cells would likely undermine long-term persistent transgene
expression from the choroid plexus, as AAV genomes do not
normally persist in dividing cell populations.
Several factors should be considered to achieve efﬁcient, global
CNS gene transfer with AAV9. First, the present studies exclusively
employed self-complementary AAV vectors, which have at least a
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

20-fold advantage over traditional single-stranded vectors
in terms of transduction efﬁciency.3,24,25 As these studies
utilized self-complementary AAV vectors, this would limit the
entire gene expression cassette (minus inverted terminal repeats)
to approximately 2.1 kb. Larger gene cassettes (up to approximately 4.6 kb) could be packaged in single-stranded vectors, but a
larger dose would likely be required to compensate for the lower
efﬁciency of traditional single-stranded AAV vectors. In this study,
we used a hyperosmolar buffer composed of PBS containing 5%
sorbitol, which is a common AAV storage buffer to prevent vector
aggregation and possible precipitation at higher concentrations.
The volume of the injection was low (1 ml compared with a
normal CSF volume of B12–15 ml in an NHP), thus only a small
and transient change in the overall CSF osmolarity would be
expected, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this affected
the biodistribution in some way. In our previous study on
intravascular AAV9 delivery to the CNS in NHPs, we used a dose
of B9  1012 vg per kg (B3–4  1013 per animal).3 Our present
intra-CSF study used a low dose of 1.8  1012 vg (approximately
6  1011 vg per kg or 1.5  1011 vg per ml CSF) per animal and a

threefold higher dose of 5.5  1012 vg per animal. Interestingly, we
did not see an increase in transduction efﬁciency between our
low- and high-dose intrathecal groups, which may suggest that

our low dose is already a saturating dose for AAV9 under
the present study parameters. However, with the low number of
high-dose animals (n ¼ 2), we cannot draw any ﬁrm conclusions. It
is entirely possible that a lower dose could provide a similar level
of transduction, but there remains the need for new vector
development to increase the transduction efﬁciency beyond the
‘saturated’ capabilities of AAV9. Samaranch et al.5 concluded
that intravascular and intracisternal AAV9 transduction was
equivalent,5 but they were using a higher intravascular dose of
3  1013 vg per kg, and if the intra-CSF dose (1.8  1013 vg per kg)
was already past saturated levels, then their study may have
missed the transduction advantage that intra-CSF delivery
provides at lower doses. Based on our results, we conclude that
AAV9 intrathecal delivery is superior to intravascular delivery to
achieve global CNS transduction, both in terms of transduction
efﬁciency and lack of translational barriers.
In summary, AAV9 and AAV2.5 can be delivered in a NHP by
intra-CSF injection to deliver globally a transgene to the entire
CNS. Intrathecal injections are routine non-surgical procedures
that are often carried out in an outpatient setting with minimal
risk. This approach has strong translational implications for
lysosomal storage diseases, or any other approach in which a
secreted gene product is utilized. The efﬁciency of spinal cord
transduction would also suggest feasible applications for motor
neuron diseases, such as spinal muscular atrophy, giant axonal
neuropathy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Virus preparation
Recombinant AAV vectors were generated using HEK293 cells grown in
serum-free suspension conditions in shaker ﬂasks, using proprietary
methods developed at the UNC Gene Therapy Center Vector Core facility
(Chapel Hill, NC, USA). In brief, the suspension HEK293 cells were
transfected using polyethyleneimine (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA,
USA) with the following helper plasmids (pGSK2/9 or pXR2.5, and pXX6–80;
Xiao et al.26) plus the inverted terminal repeat-ﬂanked transgene construct
pTRS-KS-CBh-EGFP (referred to throughout this manuscript as GFP),16 to
generate self-complementary AAV vectors. At 48 h post-transfection, cell
cultures were centrifuged and supernatant was discarded. The cells were
resuspended and lysed through sonication as described.27 DNase (550 U)
was added to the lysate and incubated at 37 1C for 45 min, followed by
centrifugation at 9400 g to pellet the cell debris and the clariﬁed lysate was
loaded onto a modiﬁed discontinuous iodixanol gradient followed by
column chromatography. Puriﬁed vectors were dialyzed in 1  PBS
containing 5% D-sorbitol. Titer was obtained by dot blot.27

Rodent studies
Animals were maintained in a 12 h light–dark cycle and had free access to
food and water. All care and procedures were in accordance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (DHHS Publication No.
(NIH) 85-23), and all procedures received prior approval by the University
of North Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee.

Figure 5. The NHP brain is transduced following intrathecal AAV9
vector administration. At 4 weeks following intrathecal injection of
scAAV9/CBh-GFP vector, 5–7 mm sections from the spinal cord and
DRG were subjected to IHC against GFP. Shown are sample images
from those used for histomorphetric quantitation in Figure 3a, and
more information is available in Supplementary Figure 6 and

Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). A measure of 5 ml of the vector solution
(8.75  109 or 1  1010 totalvg per mouse) was injected into the intrathecal
space of the lower lumbar cord in a non-sedated mouse, as described in
Hylden and Wilcox.29 For intrathecal delivery, scAAV9 vector was prepared in a
vehicle solution containing 10–12.5% lidocaine-HCl (MPI Biomedicals, Solon,
OH, USA) in 1  PBS þ 3.75% sorbitol. Needle penetration into the intrathecal
space was indicated by a tail ﬂick, thereafter successful injections were
conﬁrmed by transient (10–15 min) bilateral paralysis of the hindlimbs from
the lidocaine.30 Animals that did not receive a successful injection were
removed from the study. Mixing AAV2 with lidocaine did not affect its
transduction of HEK293 cells, and injecting AAV9 into mice (intrathecally)
without lidocaine did not alter the transduction pattern (data not shown). At
termination, the mice were transcardially perfused with PBS containing 1 U ml
heparin (Abraxis Pharmaceutic Products, Shaumburn, IL, USA).

qPCR and biodistribution

Figure 6. AAV9 strongly transduces the choroid plexus after
intrathecal administration in NHPs. At 4 weeks following intrathecal
injection of scAAV9/CBh-GFP vector, 5–7 mm sections were collected
and subjected to IHC against GFP. The image is from NHP no. 206,
block 2A (see Supplementary Figure 6), with the lateral ventricle and
surrounding parenchyma shown. Dense GFP staining is observed in
virtually all of the ependymal cells of the choroid plexus (open
arrow), no GFP seen in the ependymal cells lining the ventricles
(closed arrow) and light GFP staining is seen in some cells within the
surrounding parenchyma. The scale bar is 100 mm, and the inset is a
 2 magnification of the area highlighted by the arrows.
For AAV infusions into the brain, rats (pathogen-free male Sprague–
Dawley rats obtained from Charles Rivers, Burlington, MA, USA; N ¼ 3) ﬁrst
were anesthetized with a 50 mg kg intraperitoneal dose of pentobarbital
and placed into a stereotaxic frame. Using a 32-gauge stainless-steel
injector and a Sage infusion pump, the rats received 10 ml of singlestranded AAV 2.5 (6.6  1010 vg) over 10 min into the right lateral ventricle
(0.6 mm anterior to Bregma, 1.2 mm lateral, 4.0 mm vertical, according to
the atlas of Paxinos and Watson28). The injector was left in place for 3 min
post-infusion to allow diffusion from the injectors. In all cases, the incision
was sutured, and the animals were allowed to recover for 14 days. At
2 weeks after ventricular AAV administration, the rats received an overdose
of pentobarbital (100 mg kg pentobarbital, intraperitoneally) and were
perfused transcardially with ice-cold 100 mM sodium PBS (pH 7.4), followed
by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).
Mouse intrathecal injections were given in 8- to 12-week-old female
BALB/c mice weighing approximately 20 g, purchased from Jackson
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

qPCR was used for vector biodistribution studies. Tissue DNA was puriﬁed
and quantitated as described.3 Data are reported as the number of doublestranded GFP DNA molecules per two copies of the monkey
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) locus, or in other
words the number of vector DNA copies per diploid NHP genome.

Immunolabeling and imaging of samples (rodent samples)
After 48 h of ﬁxation in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde, tissue samples
were sectioned at 40 mm using a Leica vibrating microtome at room
temperature. To enhance the signal observed with GFP, IHC was
performed. Samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in
blocking solution (10% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1  PBS), and then
incubated 48–72 h at 4 1C in primary antibody solution (3% goat serum,
0.1% Triton X-100, 1  PBS, rabbit anti-GFP (1:500; Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA; no. AB3080)). After washing three times in 1  PBS, secondary
ampliﬁcation was performed using a VectaStain ABC Elite Kit (Vector Labs,
Burlingame, CA, USA; no. PK-6101) with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (DAB; Polysciences Inc.; no. 04008) substrate and nickel–cobalt
intensiﬁcation of the reaction product.
For immunoﬂuorescence (Supplementary Figure 1), sections were incubated with a monoclonal antibody to Nestin (1:1000; Chemicon, Temecula,
CA, USA). Following incubation for 48 h, the sections were rinsed with PBS and
blocked again for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 10% goat
serum. Sections were then incubated for 45 min at 4 1C with Alexa Fluor 594conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) in PBS containing 3% goat serum. Rinsed sections were mounted
and ﬂuorescence was visualized by confocal microscopy.

Microscopy
DAB-processed brain sections were digitized using a Scan-Scope slide
scanner (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA, USA). Virtual slides were viewed

using ImageScope software package (v. 10.0; Aperio Technologies), and
images were generated using the same software. For immunoﬂuorescence
studies, colocalization with native GFP ﬂuorescence was determined from
a minimum of ﬁve consecutive steps in a Z-series taken at 1-mm intervals
through the section of interest using a  40 objective.

cord samples were washed and mounted onto slides, visualized on a Leica
SP2 confocal microscope with a  20 objective. Each image is merged
from at least ﬁve serial Z-stacks. Unstained brain and spinal cord sections at
40 mm were mounted onto slides for native GFP visualization.

NHP NAb titer
NHP studies
Animals, surgeries, necropsy and tissue processing (performed by MPI
Research). NHP studies were conducted on a contractual basis by MPI
Research (Mattawan, MI, USA), in accordance with NIH guidelines and
approved by their Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male
cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were used, with weights and
ages provided in Table 1, and all study animals received standard housing
and care. For injections into the cisterna magna, the animals were sedated
with ketamine and the back of the head was shaved for access to the
cisterna magna. The animal was placed in lateral recumbence and the
head was tilted forward. The cisterna magna was accessed using an overthe-needle catheter and placement was veriﬁed by the presence of CSF.
The animal was slowly infused with 1.5 ml of vector, followed by a ﬂush of
0.2 ml of sterile saline. The needle was removed and the animal was
allowed to recover normally. For lumbar intrathecal injections, each animal
was sedated, placed on its stomach, a small skin incision made over L3–L4
and a 22-gauge spinal needle introduced into the intrathecal space using
clean technique. Placement of the needle was veriﬁed by ﬂuoroscopy. The
vector (1 ml) was slowly injected by hand, the needle withdrawn and the
incision site closed. Each animal was maintained in a ventral recumbancy
until recovered from anesthesia. In all experiments, subjects were killed at
4 weeks post-injection and perfused with PBS. Serum samples were
collected before injection and at the time of being killed. CSF samples were
collected just before injection, 2 h post-injection and at the time of being
killed.
At the time of killing, samples of the liver, spleen, kidney, heart, lung and
testis were collected. For the intracisternal injections and intrathecal
animals 303 and 304, the brain was divided into six coronal blocks (see
Supplementary Figure 5) and samples from each block were sectioned at
5–7 mm on a cryostat. Sections from the cervical, thoracic and lumbar
spinal cord and DRG were also collected. These sections were subjected to
IHC against GFP (or with no primary antibody as a control) for gene
expression analysis. Conditions were optimized so that IHC performed on
naı̈ve animal tissue showed no background staining; positive and negative
control images are provided in Supplementary Figure 4. In each sample,
seven random ﬁelds were selected for histomorphometric analysis of the
percentage of the area that was positive for GFP, to provide an unbiased
quantiﬁcation of the gene expression biodistribution. For the follow-up
intrathecal studies, the same samples were collected, except that the brain
was divided into ﬁve coronal blocks (see Supplementary Figure 6) and the
optic nerve was also collected. Brain, spinal cord, DRG, optic nerve,
liver and spleen sections were collected and subjected to IHC against GFP
and histomorphometric analysis on two random ﬁelds, as was done
for the four animals injected into the cisterna magna. These IHC and
histomorphometric studies were carried out by MPI Research. Samples
from the identical regions on the contralateral side were sent to UNC for
biodistribution analysis.
The above-mentioned samples stained for GFP were used for
quantiﬁcation of GFP-positive cells in speciﬁc brain areas. An inverted
Leica DMIRB microscope with a color Micropublisher camera was used to
generate the images at an objective of  20 (Supplementary Figure 7). The
number of GFP-positive brown (DAB) cells, as well as the total number of
blue (cresyl violet) nuclei, were manually counted and the percentage of
GFP-positive cells for each brain region was calculated.
To perform cellular identiﬁcation of the GFP-transduced cells, 40 mm
brain sections were incubated at 41 in PBS-T (1  PBS þ 0.1% Triton X-100)
containing 3% serum and a rabbit anti-GFP (1:500; Millipore; no. AB3080),
mouse anti-GFAP (1:1000; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA; no. 032M4779) or
mouse anti-NeuN (1:500; Millipore; no. MAB377). At 48 h post-incubation;
these samples were washed in PBS-T and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (1:2000; Invitrogen; no.
A11008) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin
G (1:2000; Invitrogen; no. A11032). In all, 40 mm spinal cord sections were
incubated with a rabbit anti-GFP (1:500) antibody and a goat anti-ChAT
(1:1000; Millipore; no. AB144P) primary. These samples were washed and
incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (1:2000;
Invitrogen; no. A21206) and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-goat
immunoglobulin G (1:2000; Invitrogen; no. A11058). Both brain and spinal
