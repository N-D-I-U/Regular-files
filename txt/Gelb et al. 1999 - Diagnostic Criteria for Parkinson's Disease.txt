Diagnostic Criteria for Parkinson Disease
Douglas J. Gelb, MD, PhD; Eugene Oliver, PhD; Sid Gilman, MD

T

he clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD) is based on the identification of some combination of the cardinal motor signs of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability, but few attempts have been made to develop explicit diagnostic criteria. We propose a clinical diagnostic classification based on a comprehensive review of the literature
regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the characteristic clinical features of PD. Three levels of diagnostic confidence are differentiated: Definite, Probable, and Possible. The diagnoses of Possible and
Probable PD are based on clinical criteria alone. Neuropathologic confirmation is required for the diagnosis of Definite PD in patients with the clinical diagnosis of Possible or Probable PD. Criteria for
histopathologic confirmation of PD are also presented.

Although neurologists generally agree that
the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease
(PD) requires identification of some combination of the cardinal motor signs of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability, few have attempted to develop
rigorous diagnostic criteria that can be applied consistently and assessed for reliability.1-5 Widely accepted diagnostic standards are particularly important at this time
of rapidly developing diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Currently, only about
75% of clinical diagnoses of PD are confirmed at autopsy,6-10 largely because the
cardinal signs can also occur in conditions other than PD; they are then termed
“extrapyramidal signs,” “parkinsonian features,” or “parkinsonism.” The goal of this
communication is to propose diagnostic criteria that reliably distinguish PD from other
conditions with parkinsonian features.
We have surveyed the clinical features that may have diagnostic utility in
PD and reviewed the published literature
regarding the sensitivity and specificity of
these features individually and in combination. This literature has several limitations that preclude a rigorous statistical
analysis. Many clinical features have not

Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md (Dr Oliver).

been studied systematically. The pertinent studies that do exist vary with respect to the population from which the patients were obtained, the procedures for
evaluating patients and identifying clinical features, and the methods of analysis
(especially retrospective vs prospective).
In most of the relevant studies, the
final diagnosis of PD has been made on
clinical grounds, so the frequency with
which a particular feature was observed
could have depended on the degree to
which that feature was required for diagnosis. For this reason, the most reliable information comes from studies in which autopsy confirmation was required for
diagnosis. Unfortunately, only a few autopsy studies have been published, and
they generally have involved only small
numbers of patients. In the largest series
of patients with autopsy-proven PD, the
clinical evaluations were not standardized, and they were performed by a large
number of different clinicians.3,8,9,11
Despite these limitations, the clinical features of PD are usually straightforward. Herein, we define a core set of clini-

cal criteria to identify patients for whom the diagnosis
of PD can be made with confidence, and a less restrictive set of criteria for identifying patients for whom the
diagnosis is likely but less certain. We reaffirm the role
of autopsy confirmation as the essential diagnostic criterion standard even in patients with typical clinical features of PD.
INDIVIDUAL CLINICAL FEATURES
Cardinal Signs
Tremor. The characteristic tremor of PD is a 3- to 6-Hz
distal resting tremor, but patients with PD may have a
resting tremor, an action tremor, or both, and the character of the tremor may change during the course of the
illness.12-14 The proportion of patients with PD who have
tremor ranges from 79% to 90% in clinical series,15-17 and
from 76% to 100% in 3 series of patients with autopsyproven PD.9,18,19 The proportion of patients with resting
tremor ranged from 69% to 100% in the 3 autopsybased series.9,18,19
Although tremor, particularly resting tremor, is more
common in PD than in other diseases with parkinsonian features, it is not rare in the other disorders. For example, in 1 series of patients with autopsy-diagnosed multiple system atrophy (MSA), 80% of patients had tremor,
and resting tremor was explicitly noted in 34% of patients. 20 In 2 other series of patients with autopsyproven MSA, tremor was reported in 13% to 31% of patients.21,22 In a series of 12 patients with autopsy-proven
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 2 patients (17%)
had a resting tremor.23 Postural tremor is even more common, occurring in 8 (47%) of 17 patients with pathologic findings of PSP.24 A postural or action tremor is present in 57% to 79% of patients with cortical-basal ganglionic
degeneration (CBGD),25,26 and 2 (29%) of 7 patients in
1 series25 had a resting tremor. In several series of patients who were assigned the histopathologic diagnosis
of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the proportion of
patients with tremor ranged from 25% to 76%,18,27-30 and
rest tremor was specifically noted in the records of 27%
of 30 patients in one series30 and 55% of 20 patients in
another.18

Postural Instability. Although many authors consider postural instability to be a cardinal feature of PD, it does not
usually occur early in the disease. In fact, the defining
feature of stage III disease on the Hoehn and Yahr scale15
for grading disability in PD is early postural instability.
These investigators found that only 37% of patients with
a disease duration of 5 years or less had reached stage
III. In contrast, postural instability and falls are the most
common initial symptoms of PSP,31 and their presence
within a year of disease onset has been considered a diagnostic requirement for that condition.31 Postural instability has limited diagnostic specificity because it can
result from a variety of problems in afferent pathways,
efferent pathways, central processing, and even musculoskeletal mechanical function.
Asymmetric Onset
Symptoms begin unilaterally in most patients with PD.
There have been few quantitative assessments of the reliability of this rule, but exceptions certainly exist. For
example, stage I of the Hoehn and Yahr15 scale is defined as unilateral involvement only, yet Hoehn and Yahr
observed that “not infrequently, Stage I is skipped and
the onset is bilateral or generalized.” In 2 series of patients with pathologically proven PD, symptoms began
asymmetrically in 72% to 75% of patients.9,21
Symptoms can also begin asymmetrically in other
movement disorders. Hughes et al3 found the initial symptoms to be asymmetric in 42% of a group of patients who
had neuropathologic diagnoses other than PD. The percentage of patients with asymmetric symptom onset
ranged from 19% to 50% in 2 series of patients with autopsy-proven PSP21,23 and from 27% to 56% in 2 series
of patients with autopsy-confirmed MSA.21,22
Thus, asymmetric onset is neither sensitive nor specific as a marker for PD. Even so, when Hughes et al3 reviewed the autopsy findings of 89 patients who met strict
clinical criteria for the diagnosis of PD, 65 of whom had
pathologic changes diagnostic of PD and 24 of whom did
not, asymmetric symptom onset was 1 of only 2 clinical
features that was statistically different between the 2
groups.
Levodopa Responsiveness

Rigidity. The frequency with which rigidity occurs in
PD has been reported explicitly in only a few series,
with values ranging from 89% to 99%.9,15-18 Rigidity is a
prominent feature of a wide variety of movement disorders and is not specific to PD. Indeed, even patients
with uncomplicated essential tremor may demonstrate
cogwheeling.12
Bradykinesia. Depending on how it is defined, bradykinesia is present in 77% to 98% of patients with PD.9,16-18
The specificity of bradykinesia as an isolated clinical
sign also depends on how it is assessed and the population under study, but bradykinesia is certainly not
unique to PD. It can occur as a result of normal aging,
depression, and Alzheimer disease, as well as more
obviously parkinsonian diseases such as PSP, MSA,
CBGD, and DLB.

Although there are documented cases of patients with autopsy-proven PD who did not respond to levodopa,32 they
are not common. In those series of patients where the
diagnosis was confirmed at autopsy, 94% to 100% of patients with PD responded to levodopa. 9,18,21,33 A response to levodopa is not specific to PD, however. Between 22% and 35% of patients with PSP respond to
levodopa, at least temporarily.21,23,24,34 Levodopa responsiveness was reported in 69% to 75% of patients with autopsy-confirmed MSA,21,35 and a good or excellent response was noted in 43% to 45% of patients.20,35 The
response diminished over time in most patients, but 7%
to 35% of patients remained at least partially responsive
to levodopa until the time of death.20,35 Among patients
with DLB who presented with parkinsonian features, 70%
to 87% responded to levodopa.18,36

Other Motor Features
Festination, blink rate, micrographia, the phenomenon
of “freezing” while walking, and blepharospasm may help
differentiate PD from other movement disorders, but these
features have not been investigated systematically. Patients with PD have distinctive speech abnormalities that
can be used to differentiate them from patients with other
movement disorders,37 but the distinctions can be subtle
and difficult to appreciate.
Nonmotor Clinical Features
Dementia. Cognitive impairment develops in a subset of
patients with PD, but estimates of the size of this subset
vary widely depending on the definition of impairment,
the duration of follow-up, and the inclusion criteria for
the series. The best estimates derived from consideration of the literature as a whole suggest that dementia
occurs in 25% to 40% of patients with PD.38-41
Considerable efforts have been made to identify particular cognitive deficits that are characteristic of the dementia of PD and other subcortical diseases, but the results have been inconclusive.42-44 Cognitive deficits appear
later and are less prominent than motor abnormalities
in most patients with PD, but there are exceptions.45,46
Depression. In clinical series in which psychiatric manifestations were not the principal subject of interest, significant depression was noted in fewer than 5% of patients.15,16 In contrast, when depression has been a focus,
it has been found in about 40% of patients with PD,47,48
though only about 8% of patients meet criteria for major affective disorder.48
Psychotic Features. Hallucinations occur in about 20%
of patients with PD who receive dopaminergic agents,49
but psychotic features are not common manifestations
of the disease itself, particularly in the early stages. Only
2% to 6% of patients with PD experienced hallucinations unrelated to medications in 2 series.50,51
Autonomic Dysfunction. Patients with PD frequently
demonstrate impaired cardiovascular response to postural changes on laboratory testing, but they are usually
asymptomatic.9,21,52 In contrast, orthostatic hypotension is one of the hallmarks of MSA.20,53,54 Patients with
PD can develop abnormal thermoregulation, gastrointestinal or urinary tract dysfunction, or impotence,52,53,55 but prominent autonomic symptoms are more
characteristic of MSA.20
Oculomotor Abnormalities. Patients with PD exhibit
abnormalities of both the saccadic and pursuit oculomotor systems,56,57 but they are minor compared with
the supranuclear vertical gaze palsy and slowing of vertical saccades that are hallmarks of PSP. Some patients
with pathologic features of PSP never exhibit a supranuclear gaze palsy, however, and are misdiagnosed as
having PD.23,24,58 Furthermore, oculomotor abnormalities are not useful in differentiating PD from MSA57 or
PD from DLB.18

Other Nonmotor Features. Characteristic abnormalities of olfactory and visual perception have been described in patients with PD, but the techniques required
to demonstrate these abnormalities are not commonly
available in standard clinical practice. Sensory symptoms and pain are often reported by patients with PD,
but the value of these symptoms in differentiating PD from
other diseases has not been determined.
COMBINATIONS OF CLINICAL FEATURES
Two clinicopathologic studies have explicitly assessed the
diagnostic accuracy achieved when 2 or more cardinal
features are required for the diagnosis of PD. Ward and
Gibb2 found that only 69% to 75% of patients with the
postmortem diagnosis of PD had at least 2 of 3 cardinal
parkinsonian features (tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia). Moreover, 21% to 25% of patients who did manifest at least 2 cardinal features had pathologic findings
of diseases other than PD. In fact, 13% to 19% of patients who demonstrated all 3 cardinal features had pathologic diagnoses other than PD.
Over a 22-year period in their movement disorder
clinic, Rajput et al7 reviewed all 59 patients with parkinsonian syndromes who had had satisfactory autopsies.
All of these patients had been seen by a single neurologist, and the diagnosis of idiopathic PD was made when
patients had at least 2 of the 3 nonpostural cardinal signs
(bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor), no identifiable cause of parkinsonism, and no clinical evidence of
widespread central nervous system lesions. The final clinical diagnosis was idiopathic PD in 41 patients, and this
was confirmed at autopsy in 31 (76%) of them.
In another series,10 autopsy confirmed the diagnosis in 489 (84%) of 580 patients thought to have PD on
clinical grounds, although the criteria for assigning a clinical diagnosis were not specified. In a series of 100 patients with the clinical diagnosis of idiopathic PD, the diagnosis could be confirmed histologically in only 76
patients.8 Eighty-nine of the 100 patients satisfied the
United Kingdom Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank
clinical criteria for idiopathic PD,1 which require that patients have bradykinesia and at least 1 of the other 3 cardinal features (rigidity, rest tremor, and postural instability), none of 16 exclusion criteria, and at least 3 of 8
supportive features (relating to asymmetric onset and progression, levodopa responsiveness, and chronic progression of clinical features). Autopsy confirmed the diagnosis in 73 (82%) of these 89 patients. Diagnostic
specificity could be increased further by requiring all 3
cardinal features (tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia) for
the diagnosis of PD, but at the expense of reduced sensitivity—only 65% of patients with a pathologic diagnosis of PD would qualify for the diagnosis clinically if these
were the criteria.3
Studies of diagnostic criteria for several other movement disorders have included patients with PD in control groups. Colosimo et al21 considered 5 clinical features thought to be typical of MSA and calculated the total
number of features demonstrated by each patient. All of
the patients with MSA had at least 2 features and none
of the patients with PD had more than 3 features, but there

was still overlap: 9 of the patients with MSA had 3 features and 4 of them had 2 features, while 2 patients with
PD had 3 features and 2 had 2 features. There was no
statistically significant difference between the patients with
PD and those with MSA with respect to symmetry of symptoms at onset, presence of resting tremor, or response to
dopaminergic drugs.
Litvan et al59 evaluated 4 combinations of diagnostic features to determine how well they distinguished PSP
from other movement disorders, including PD. Even at
the time of the final clinical evaluation, averaging more
than 2 years after the initial evaluation and more than 5
years after symptom onset, the 4 combinations had sensitivities for the diagnosis of PSP of only 34% to 89%. Litvan et al proposed a new classification to optimize sensitivity and positive predictive value, incorporating 3
mandatory inclusion criteria and 8 mandatory exclusion criteria. With these criteria, sensitivity was only 57%
at the first clinical evaluation and 66% at the final visit,
and positive predictive value was 85% at the first visit
and 76% at the last visit.
Goetz et al60 evaluated 4 combinations of clinical features for their utility as criteria in differentiating patients with PD from patients with CBGD. All diagnoses
were autopsy proven. For 3 of the 4 combinations, patients who met the criteria had a high probability of having PD, but a high proportion of patients with the neuropathologic diagnosis of PD failed to meet the clinical
criteria.
In summary, diagnostic accuracy for PD and the diseases that resemble it can be improved by using appropriately selected combinations of clinical features rather than
the individual features. Even using these combinations,
however, a considerable number of diagnostic errors occur. Diagnostic specificity for a given disease can be improved by choosing criteria that are more restrictive, but
this usually results in greatly reduced sensitivity.
DIAGNOSTIC NEUROIMAGING
Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques are
evolving rapidly, and imaging characteristics that distinguish patients with PD from normal controls and from patients with other parkinsonian conditions have been described.61,62 Relative to controls, patients with PD and other
parkinsonian syndromes have narrowing of the substantia nigra pars compacta on heavily T2-weighted magnetic
resonance imaging scans. Putaminal hypointensity is seen
in MSA and PSP but not in PD. Slitlike hyperintensity in
the outer margin of the putamen may be specific for MSA,
though this has not been established rigorously. Positron
emission tomographic studies with fluorodopa F 18 and
single photon emission computed tomographic studies with
b-CIT iodine 123 or FP-CIT iodine 123 have shown significantly less striatal uptake in patients with PD than in
controls, especially in the posterior putamen, and the striatal uptake is inversely correlated with severity of motor
impairment. In contrast to the preferential involvement
of the posterior putamen in PD, fluorodopa F 18 uptake
is reduced more uniformly throughout the putamen and
caudate nucleus in patients with PSP, MSA, and CBGD,
but attempts to differentiate patients with PD from pa-

tients with other parkinsonian conditions on this basis have
been only partially successful. Metabolic imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography can
discriminate patients with PD from normal subjects and
from patients with atypical parkinsonism, and these findings also correlate with the severity of disease. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy has also been reported to differentiate between PD and other parkinsonian conditions.
All of these imaging modalities are costly, and some
of them are not widely available. Before any can be recommended for routine diagnostic use, their relative advantages and disadvantages must be clarified. Studies
based on autopsy-confirmed diagnoses will also be important. If future research confirms and extends the present results, neuroimaging studies have the potential to
play a fundamental role in the diagnosis of PD.
PROPOSED CLINICAL DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA
Several conclusions emerge from the preceding review.
First, no individual clinical feature has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to serve as the sole basis for distinguishing PD from other diseases with parkinsonian features. Criteria based on combinations of clinical features
improve diagnostic accuracy, but no criteria proposed to
date have achieved a high enough positive predictive value
to eliminate the need for autopsy confirmation.63 Second, although no single clinical feature is completely reliable for differentiating PD from other conditions, some
features are more useful than others.
Third, there is almost always a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, so at least 2 different levels of diagnostic confidence should be included in the classification. These different levels are commonly designated
Definite, Probable, and Possible. For some purposes, such
as certain therapeutic trials, maximum diagnostic specificity is required and lower sensitivity is acceptable, so
patients meeting the most restrictive criteria are preferred. For other purposes, such as epidemiologic studies or therapeutic trials in early stages of the disease, it is
appropriate to sacrifice some specificity and use the more
inclusive Possible criteria.
Fourth, the opportunity for diagnostic confusion is
greatest early in the clinical course when some of the more
distinctive clinical features may not yet have developed.7,59 Thus, to increase specificity, the clinical diagnosis of PD should be regarded as preliminary until parkinsonian symptoms have been present for a substantial
period of time to ensure that patients do not develop features suggestive of alternative diagnoses.
These 4 conclusions provide the rationale for the proposed diagnostic classification scheme shown in Table 1
and Table 2. Patient diagnoses are classified as Probable when the patients have clinical features that are absolutely typical of PD, at least 3 years of parkinsonian
symptoms without the development of atypical features, and a clear clinical response to dopaminergic treatment. The criteria for Possible PD are less strict: patients are not required to have as many typical features
of PD, symptom duration can be less than 3 years, and
patients need not have received an adequate trial of dopaminergic therapy. A recent analysis of a large clinical

Substantial nerve cell depletion with accompanying gliosis in the

Table 2. Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Parkinson Disease
Criteria for POSSIBLE diagnosis of Parkinson disease:
At least 2 of the 4 features in Group A* are present; at least 1 of
these is tremor or bradykinesia
and
Either None of the features in Group B* is present
Or Symptoms have been present for less than 3 years, and none

and

Criteria for PROBABLE diagnosis of Parkinson disease:
At least 3 of the 4 features in Group A* are present
and
None of the features in Group B* is present (note: symptom
duration of at least 3 years is necessary to meet this requirement)
and
Substantial and sustained response to levodopa or a dopamine
agonist has been documented
Criteria for DEFINITE diagnosis of Parkinson disease:
All criteria for POSSIBLE Parkinson disease are met
and
Histopathologic confirmation of the diagnosis is obtained at autopsy

*Group A and Group B are detailed in Table 1.

trial involving patients with early PD suggests that roughly
90% of patients who meet criteria for Possible PD will
ultimately qualify for the diagnosis of Probable PD.64
No patient who has failed to respond to an adequate trial of dopaminergic therapy meets criteria for
either Probable or Possible PD. All patients who meet
the criteria for Probable PD also satisfy the requirements for Possible PD. Patients in either category who
have autopsy findings consistent with PD (Table 3)

are designated as Definite. Thus, neuropathologic
examination remains an absolute requirement for the
diagnosis of PD in patients with typical clinical features.
NEUROPATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS OF PD
The absence of a completely reliable clinical marker for
PD makes neuropathologic confirmation essential in
evaluating the diagnostic utility of clinical features or combinations of features. Classically, the neuropathologic features of PD are relatively straightforward: the substantia
nigra reveals neuronal loss and Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies are also usually present in the locus ceruleus, nucleus
basalis of Meynert, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus,
and hypothalamus, and often at other sites of predilection. In patients with typical clinical features and these
pathologic findings, the diagnosis is clear.
The neuropathologic findings are sometimes ambiguous or conflicting, however, and the specificity and
sensitivity of individual pathologic features are not known.
For example, some patients have typical clinical features and neuronal loss in the substantia nigra but no Lewy
bodies. Conversely, some patients have Lewy bodies without neuronal degeneration or even clinical abnormalities. Indeed, the incidence of Lewy bodies in the brains
of asymptomatic individuals increases with advancing
age, raising the question of whether Lewy bodies are
markers for presymptomatic PD or a feature of normal
aging.1,66,67 Lewy bodies also occur in 10% to 40% of individuals with Alzheimer disease, motor neuron disease, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, ataxia telangiectasia, CBGD, and Hallervorden-Spatz disease, 66-68
suggesting that Lewy bodies may not represent specific
underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Similarly,
many parkinsonian patients with Lewy bodies also have
pathologic findings of Alzheimer disease (neuritic
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles).10,30,67,68
The importance of the distribution of Lewy bodies
is also unclear. Some reports have described Lewy bodies in the neocortex of all or nearly all patients with PD,8,69
suggesting that there may be a continuum ranging from
patients with relatively pure neocortical involvement to
patients with primarily brainstem Lewy bodies, rather than
a strict distinction between PD and DLB. Samuel et al70
found a correlation between the degree of dementia and
the extent of neocortical Lewy bodies, although other authors9,46,71 have described patients with PD and demen-

tia who had little or no cortical abnormality (ie, few if
any cortical Lewy bodies, plaques, or tangles).
In light of these unresolved issues, there are no universally accepted histopathologic criteria for the diagnosis of PD. The criteria presented in Table 3 are consistent with the criteria typically used in published
clinicopathologic series. In particular, the presence of even
a single Lewy body in the substantia nigra or locus ceruleus is regarded as important in patients with typical
clinical features of PD. Indeed, Lewy bodies are uncommon enough in asymptomatic people to justify the suspicion that these individuals may have had early PD and
died before they became symptomatic. In contrast, the
implications of cortical Lewy bodies are poorly understood, so although their density and distribution should
be recorded, they do not influence the diagnosis of PD
in patients with typical clinical features and brainstem
histopathologic abnormality.
TOPICS FOR FURTHER STUDY
The clinical diagnostic criteria proposed here will need
to be validated in future clinicopathologic studies. These
studies can also be used to refine the criteria empirically. For example, it might be appropriate to weigh some
clinical features more heavily than others, or it could be
helpful to consider the severity of some clinical features
rather than just their presence or absence. Inclusion of
radiologic findings could add considerable diagnostic
power. Some of the features that preclude the diagnosis
of Definite PD, such as the failure to respond to an adequate trial of dopaminergic treatment or the presence
of hallucinations early in the course, may require modification if enough patients are found to have these features together with otherwise typical clinical and pathologic findings of PD. These issues should be addressed
systematically by prospectively identifying a broad range
of clinical findings and assessing them consistently in patients recruited from diverse clinical settings. Neuropathologic examinations also should be conducted in a
standardized fashion with as few preconceived notions
as possible. To determine the importance of cortical Lewy
bodies, for example, they should be analyzed routinely
in a large group of patients presenting with either parkinsonism or cognitive impairment or both, and the results should be correlated with information on cognitive and motor function collected systematically
throughout the clinical course.
An inherent limitation of clinicopathologic studies
is that the pathologic information is typically obtained
after the disease has reached advanced stages. Clinical
examinations are often technically difficult in patients with
advanced disease, limiting the reliability of clinicopathologic correlation. Moreover, a variety of different disease processes may converge in advanced stages to produce similar clinical phenotypes. This limitation is
surmounted by some of the new neuroimaging techniques that permit clinical-anatomical correlation at earlier stages of the disease. Even so, the interpretation of
these studies will be difficult until the neuroimaging results have been evaluated in patients who have come to
postmortem examination.

There is no doubt that the diagnostic criteria proposed here ultimately will be revised. In the meantime,
there is an immediate need for plausible, straightforward, standard criteria for use in clinical research. The
criteria proposed here, based on a thorough review of currently available information, are intended to serve this
purpose.
