Genome-encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) are potent regulators of gene expression. The
significance of miRNAs in various biological processes has been suggested by studies
showing an important role of these small RNAs in regulation of cell differentiation. However,
the role of miRNAs in regulation of differentiated cell physiology is not well established.
Mature neurons express a large number of distinct miRNAs, but the role of miRNAs in
postmitotic neurons has not been examined. Here, we provide evidence for an essential
role of miRNAs in survival of differentiated neurons. We show that conditional Purkinje
cell–specific ablation of the key miRNA-generating enzyme Dicer leads to Purkinje cell
death. Deficiency in Dicer is associated with progressive loss of miRNAs, followed by
cerebellar degeneration and development of ataxia. The progressive neurodegeneration
in the absence of Dicer raises the possibility of an involvement of miRNAs in neurodegenerative disorders.

The recently discovered potent role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulation of gene and
protein expression suggests an important role
for these small RNAs in regulation of various
physiological processes. miRNAs are 21-ntlong noncoding RNAs that are processed from
endogenously generated 70-nt-long hairpin
structures by the RNase III enzyme Dicer.
The nascent miRNA is incorporated into the
RNA-induced silencing complex that mediates
miRNA-dependent translational suppression or,
in rare cases, cleavage of respective mRNA
targets (for review see references 1–3). Ablation of the miRNA-generating enzyme Dicer
revealed a requirement for miRNAs in development of immune cells (4–6), skin progenitors (7), and limb outgrowth (8). The predicted
role of miRNAs in regulation of mammalian
cell function has been underscored by findings
that show the ability of individual miRNAs to
affect differentiation and function of cells of
various lineages, including T cells (9) and cardiac
myocytes (10, 11).
Several lines of evidence indicate the possibility of an important role of miRNAs in neuronal cells. Compared with other organs, both

mouse and human brain express an exceptionally
diverse spectrum of distinct miRNAs (12–16).
Furthermore, the existence of neuron-specific
miRNAs argues in favor of their important
role in neuronal differentiation and/or specialized functions. The involvement of miRNAs
in neuronal differentiation is strongly supported
by dynamic changes in miRNA expression during brain development (14, 17, 18). Moreover,
the ability of neuron-specific miRNA miR-124a
to suppress expression of nonneuronal genes in
an in vitro cell system suggests an important
role for miRNAs as regulators of neuronal differentiation (19). The significance of miRNAs
in neuronal physiology is also suggested by
data that show miRNA involvement in dendritic spine formation and neurite outgrowth
in vitro (20, 21). In summary, although there
is mounting evidence for important roles for
miRNAs in neuron cell differentiation, their role
in differentiated, postmitotic neurons has not
been addressed.
Using Purkinje cells as a model system to
analyze the role of miRNAs in postmitotic
neurons, we demonstrate an essential role for
miRNAs in neuronal survival. We show that
inactivation of Dicer leads to relatively rapid disappearance of Purkinje cell–expressed miRNAs,

followed by a slow degeneration of the Purkinje cells. The
loss of Dicer and the decay of miRNAs have no immediate
impact on Purkinje cell function as analyzed by Purkinje cell
electrophysiological characteristics and animal locomotion.
However, the continuous lack of miRNAs leads eventually to
Purkinje cell death and ataxia. Collectively, our data suggest
that miRNAs are essential for the survival of Purkinje cells and
their absence leads to a slow degeneration of these cells.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Dicer inactivation in differentiated Purkinje cells
The ubiquitously expressed endonuclease Dicer is essential
for the generation of miRNAs (22, 23). To address the role
of miRNAs in postmitotic, differentiated neurons, we used
postnatal ablation of the miRNA-generating enzyme Dicer
in Purkine cells. There were several reasons for choosing
Purkinje cells as a model system for the analysis of miRNA
function: (a) Purkinje cells have a well-defined anatomic
location and morphology; (b) these cells are easy to quantify; (c) their electrophysiological characteristics are well
established; (d) changes in Purkinje cell physiology or survival lead to a characteristic functional phenotype consisting
of a profound ataxia; and (e) the conditional inactivation of
loxP-flanked gene segments in Purkinje cells could be achieved
by using Purkinje cell–specific Pcp2 promotor–driven Cre
recombinase (24). Importantly, the Pcp2 gene remains silent
until the second week after birth, at which time Purkinje
cells are postmitotic and have reached their final stage of
differentiation.
The Purkinje cell–specific Dicer inactivation was achieved
by Purkinje cell–specific Pcp2 promoter–driven Cre-mediated
recombination of the Dicer alleles modified with loxP sites
(Pcp2-Cre; Dicer flox/flox; references 7 and 24). To visualize Purkinje cells that express Cre at levels sufficient for loxP site recombination, we used a reporter system that enables enhanced
GFP (eGFP) expression after Cre-mediated loxP recombination (25). In the absence of Cre, the eGFP gene stays dormant but becomes activated after Cre-mediated excision of
the transcriptional stop cassette that separates the eGFP gene
from the ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 promoter. The expression of eGFP combined with analysis of the miRNA
expression was used to follow the timing and consequence of
Dicer inactivation in Purkinje cells.
The appearance of eGFP+ Purkinje cells in Pcp2-Cre;
Dicer flox/flox; Gt(ROSA)26Sor;EGFP was observed around 4 wk
after birth (Fig. 1, E and H), and eGFP expression was detected in the vast majority of Purkinje cells around 8 wk of
age (Fig. 1, F and I). At both time points the brain-specific
miRNA miR-124a, which is highly abundant in control
Purkinje cells, could not be detected in Purkinje cells of
Pcp2-Cre; Dicer flox/flox; Gt(ROSA)26Sor;EGFP mice (Fig. 1,
J–L). The lack of the highly abundant and widely expressed
miRNA miR-124a in Purkinje cells, but not in neighboring
granule cells of Pcp2-Cre; Dicer flox/flox; Gt(ROSA)26Sor;EGFP
mice, suggests efficient and Purkinje cell–specific Dicer inactivation at 4 wk of age.

BRIEF DEFINITIVE REPORT

As judged by in situ analysis of the miRNA expression,
inactivation of Dicer had different effects on the timing of
the disappearance of the Purkinje cell–expressed miRNAs.
Purkinje cells of 8-wk-old Pcp2-Cre; Dicer flox/flox mice did not
express miR-1, miR-29a, miR-30c, miR-101a, miR-103,
miR-124a, miR-125b, and miR-181a at detectable levels
(Table S1 and Fig. 2). However, >2 mo after the first appearance of the eGFP+ Purkinje cells and hence well beyond
the time of Dicer inactivation (Fig. 1), the miRNAs miR-107,
miR-134, miR-138, miR-143, miR-149, miR-212, miR-221,
and miR-329 remained detectable in the cerebellum of the
Pcp2-Cre; Dicer flox/flox mice (Table S1 and Fig. 2). The observed presence of miRNA in the absence of Dicer could
be genuine and reflect differential stability of the miRNAs.
Alternatively, the revealed in situ hybridization signals may
reflect nonspecific binding of the miRNA-specific probes to
the pre-miRNAs that accumulate in the absence of Dicer.

Deficiency in Dicer and miRNAs leads to degeneration
of Purkinje cells
The absence of Dicer and the decline in miRNA expression
in the cerebellum of 8-wk-old Pcp2-Cre; Dicer flox/flox mice had
no obvious effect on Purkinje cell morphology or number
(Figs. 1 and 2). Similar to the control mice, the Purkinje cells
of 10-wk-old Pcp2-Cre; Dicer flox/flox mice displayed unaltered
cell bodies and highly branched dendrites of normal width
and length (Fig. 3, B, F, J, and M). Analysis of the electrophysiological properties of Purkinje cells of 10-wk-old Pcp2Cre; Dicer flox/flox mice did not reveal significant differences

between the mutant and wild-type Purkinje cells. These results indicate that there were no obvious changes in the synaptic transmission properties of the parallel or climbing fiber
synapses in 10-wk-old mice. Furthermore, judging from spike
waveform and repetitive firing properties, voltage-gated ionic
channel distribution over the Purkinje soma dendritic plasmalemma was normal (not depicted).
Absence of miRNAs resulted eventually in Purkinje cell
death and degeneration of the cerebellum (Fig. 3, C, D, G
and H). Purkinje cells of the 10-wk-old Pcp2-Cre; Dicer flox/flox
mice were morphologically similar to control mice (Fig. 3, I,
J, L, and M). In contrast, the dendrites of 13-wk-old mutant
Purkinje cells showed spine loss in combination with fragmentation of the dendritic compartment, enlarged varicosities, and blebs in the form of pearl-like structures. Notably,
all of these fragmented dendrites were still enclosed by an intact plasma membrane as determined by their ability to retain
the fluorescent dye (Fig. 3, K and N).
The consequences of miRNA deficiency became particularly obvious between 13 and 17 wk of age. During this
period, degenerative alterations in Dicer-deficient Purkinje
cells spread from the anterior zone (lobules I–V) to the central (lobules VI–VII) and posterior (lobules VIII–IX) zones
(Fig. 3, C and D).
At the ultrastructural level, dying Purkinje cells displayed
condensation of the cytoplasm accompanied by the occurrence of intracisternal and cytosolic electron-dense structures
that are reminiscent of protein inclusions, autophagic-like
vacuoles, and membrane whorls (Fig. 4, A–E). In addition,

Published July 2, 2007

few Tdt-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL)+
and hence apoptotic nuclei cells were present in the cerebellar Purkinje cells of Pcp2-Cre; Dicer flox/flox mice (Fig. 4, F–H),
whereas many TUNEL+ granule cells were observed (not
depicted). The apoptotic death of granule cells is likely to be
induced by dying Purkinje cells as suggested by earlier findings (26, 27).
In summary, deficiency in miRNAs resulted in a slow
Purkinje cell degeneration. Given the relatively global nature
of the miRNA deficiency, the cause of Purkinje cell death
is hard to determine. It cannot be excluded that the lack of
negative regulation of protein expression by miRNAs leads
to protein accumulation, followed by cell stress response and
death. In support of this model, we observed accumulation of
1556

intracisternal and cytosolic protein aggregates in Dicer-deficient
Purkinje cells (Fig. 4, A–E). It is also possible that the lack of
pre-miRNA processing in the absence of Dicer results in
accumulation of pre-miRNAs at toxic quantities.
Dicer deficiency in Purkinje cells causes ataxia
The depletion of miRNAs and accompanying degeneration
of Purkinje cells led to ataxia. The motor functions of young
(8-wk-old) Pcp2-Cre; Dicer flox/flox mice were indistinguishable
from those of control mice. However, at 13 wk of age and
at the time of significant miRNA decline, the Pcp2-Cre;
Dicer flox/flox mice started to develop a slight tremor and mild
ataxia. These symptoms were aggravated within the next months.
The analysis of motor function and balance, as examined by
the rotarod test, displayed a severe impairment in 17-wk-old
Pcp2-Cre; Dicer flox/flox mice (Fig. 5 A). The footprint analysis confirmed an ataxic walking pattern of the Pcp2-Cre; Dicer flox/flox
mice (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that miRNA deficiency
in Purkinje cells results in a severe cerebellar dysfunction around
17 wk of age.

BRIEF DEFINITIVE REPORT

Conclusion
Here, we show the essential role of Dicer and miRNAs in the
regulation of postmitotic neuronal survival. Although Dicer
deficiency had no immediate impact on Purkinje cell function,
the long-term absence of Dicer resulted in a neurodegenerative
process. This pattern of Purkinje cell degeneration in the absence of miRNAs bears obvious similarity to processes associated with the slow progressing neurodegenerative diseases such
as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Our findings may help
to identify individual miRNAs that contribute critically to
neuronal cell survival. Finally, identification of miRNAs as
critical regulators of neuronal survival may provide additional
insight into the molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

miRNA detection. MiRNAs were detected by in situ hybridization using
3′ DIG-labeled LNA oligonucleotide probes from Exiqon purified using
Sephadex G25 MicroSpin columns (GE Healthcare). 1–10 pmol of each
labeled probe was used in 250 μl of hybridization buffer per slide. Hybridization was performed according to the published protocol (29).
Immunohistochemistry and indirect immunofluorescence. Sections
were incubated in 0.3% H2O2/PBS at room temperature for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton/PBS, and blocked with 2% normal goat serum.
Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with a primary antibody against
calbindin D-28 (dilution 1:5000; Swant) and visualized by the avidin–biotin–
peroxidase complex method (Vector Laboratories). The sections were counterstained using standard Nissl-stain. For indirect immunofluorescence
analysis, calbindin D-28 (dilution 1:5000, Swant) and GFP (dilution 1:5,000;
ab6556; Abcam) antibodies followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor
546/488–labeled goat anti–mouse/anti–rabbit IgGs (H+L) (dilution 1:500;
Invitrogen) were used.
TUNEL staining. The In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (fluorescein;
Roche) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purkinje cells
were visualized by subsequent immunostaining using an antibody against
calbindin D-28 (as described above).
All sections from in situ, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence,
and TUNEL staining were then visualized on a confocal microscope (LSM510;
Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.).
Behavioral analysis. The motor function and balance of control and Pcp2Cre; Dicer flox/flox mice were analyzed via the rotarod task (Economex
Rotarod; Colombus Instruments) at initial rotation of 1 rpm, accelerating at
a rate of 0.3 rpm/sec. The time taken for the mice to fall from the rod was
measured in seconds. If a mouse stayed on the rod until the end of the 3-min
trial, a time of 180 s was recorded. Mice were subjected to 5 d of consecutive
trials, and measurements were taken on day 6. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test and Anova single factor analysis.
Footprint patterns were obtained by dipping front paws in red nontoxic
ink and hind paws in black nontoxic ink and placing mice at one end of a
dark tunnel.
Electron microscopy. Mice were perfused using 5 ml PBS followed by
50 ml 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate acid buffer, pH 7.4, and processed for transmission electron microscopy according to standard protocols.

analysis (F = 5.976822099; P = 0.00024395; F crit = 2.41735603). Latency to fall from the rod was measured in control Pcp2-Cre; Dicer+/flox
(gray) and mutant Pcp2-Cre; Dicerflox/flox (black) mice at 8 (control, n = 10;
mutant, n = 8; P = 0.73494913), 13 (control, n = 10; mutant, n = 7;

Two-photon imaging. Imaging was implemented with 100 μM of the
calcium-sensing dye Fura 2 dissolved in the patch electrode solution. The
images were obtained using a two-photon laser microscope (AX70; Olympus) as described previously (30). Two-photon images were acquired and
processed with an in-house program. Imaris software was used for visualization and analysis of the individual images.
Online supplemental material. In Table S1, expression of miRNAs in
Dicer-deficient Purkinje cells is shown. The expression of many miRNAs
reported for whole brain extracts (12–16) has been validated for Purkinje
cells using in situ hybridization in 8-wk-old C57BL/6 wild-type mice. The
expression levels of these miRNAs in Purkinje cells of 8- and 13-wk-old
Pcp2-Cre; Dicer flox/flox mice relative to control Pcp2-Cre; Dicer+/flox mice are
indicated. The expression levels of miRNAs in control mice were given
an arbitrary value of “+++.” The miRNA expression in Purkinje cells of

Mice. Dicerflox/flox (7), Pcp2-Cre (24), and Gt(ROSA)26Sor;EGFP (25)
mice were intercrossed to generate Pcp2-Cre; Dicer flox/flox and Pcp2-Cre;
Dicer flox/flox; Gt(ROSA)26Sor;EGFP mice. Genotyping was performed as described previously (7, 24, 25). Mice were housed under standard laboratory
conditions at The Rockefeller University Laboratory Animal Research Center. Protocols were approved by The Rockefeller University Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.

Cerebellar slice preparation. Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbitol
and transcardially perfused as described previously (28). Brains were postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, incubated sequentially in 5, 15, and
30% wt/vol sucrose in PBS at 4°C, and embedded in Neg-50 medium
(Richard Allen Scientific). 10–20-μm-thick sagittal sections were mounted
on Superfrost/Plus slides (Fisher Scientific). Before use, sections were thawed,
dried for 10 min at room temperature, and washed in PBS.
