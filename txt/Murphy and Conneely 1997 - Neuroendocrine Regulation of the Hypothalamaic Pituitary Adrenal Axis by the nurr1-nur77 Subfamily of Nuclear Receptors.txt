NOT) (5, 6) is an orphan member of the superfamily (7)
that is expressed predominantly in the central nervous
system (7, 8). The protein exhibits a close structural
relationship to the orphan receptors nur77 (also called
NGFIB/N10/NAK) (9–12) and NOR-1 (also called MINOR/TEC) (13–16). All three proteins are members of a
nuclear receptor subgroup (hereafter referred to as the
nurr1 subfamily) that bind as monomers to the cisacting sequence, AAAGGTCA, to regulate gene expression without a requirement for ligand binding (14,
17–19). Nurr1 and nur77 have also been implicated in
the regulation of retinoid-signaling pathways by heterodimerizing with the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor,
RXR, and binding to the AAAGGTCA motif when arranged as two directly repeated elements (20). Thus,
the nurr1 subfamily has the capacity to regulate overlapping gene networks if expressed in the same cells.
Transcripts for the nurr1 subfamily are constitutively
expressed in a differentially restricted but partially
overlapping temporal and spatial pattern (7, 8).
Whereas nurr1 expression appears to be restricted to
brain tissue in the developing and adult mouse, the
constitutive expression of nur77 and NOR-1 is observed in some peripheral tissues in addition to brain
(7, 14). Nur77 mRNA is present in several tissues including testis, ovary, and muscle (7) whereas low
NOR-1 expression is detected in the thymus, kidney,
and spleen (14). Further, unlike most nuclear receptors, these proteins are products of immediate early
genes whose expression can be differentially induced
in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli including growth factors (9, 10, 21), neurotransmitters (22,
23), and polypeptide hormones (24, 25).
Several lines of evidence indicate that the members
of the nurr1 subfamily may play an important role in the
coordinate neuroendocrine regulation of the activity of
the hypothalamic/pituitary/adrenal (HPA) axis. This
axis is regulated at the level of the hypothalamus by
CRF, which is synthesized in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). In response to stressful
stimuli, CRF is released from the PVN and transported
to the anterior pituitary causing an increase in synthesis of POMC. POMC is a precursor molecule of several

The present study was designed to examine the
role of the nurr1/nur77 subfamily of nuclear receptor transcription factors in the regulation of the
hypothalamic/pituitary/adrenal axis at the neuroendocrine level. We demonstrate that this nuclear receptor subfamily can regulate the expression of the CRF and POMC genes by interacting
with a specific cis-acting sequence in their proximal promoter regions. To examine the physiological significance of this response, we have focused
on the POMC gene. We provide evidence that nurr1
and nur77 are rapidly induced by CRF in primary
pituitary cells and that this induction is mimicked
by forskolin in an anterior pituitary cell line. Further, we demonstrate that both nurr1- and forskolin-dependent induction of a POMC-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene are inhibited
by mutation of the nurr1-binding site within the
POMC promoter and that this site alone can confer
cAMP responsiveness to a heterologous promoter.
Finally, we provide evidence that the nurr1/nur77
response sequence is pivotal to both nurr1/nur77dependent positive regulation and glucocorticoid
receptor-dependent negative regulation of the
POMC gene. These data strongly support the conclusion that the nurr1/nur77 subfamily plays an important coordinate neuroendocrine-regulatory role
at all levels of the hypothalamic/pituitary/adrenal
axis. (Molecular Endocrinology 11: 39–47, 1997)

INTRODUCTION
Nuclear receptors comprise a superfamily of structurally related transcription factors that control a variety
of developmental, physiological, and behavioral processes (1–3). The family includes receptors for lipophilic hormones and vitamins as well as a majority
of orphan members whose physiological function is
poorly understood (4). Nurr1 (also called rnr-1 and

neuropeptides including ACTH, which is released from
the pituitary and regulates the synthesis of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex. To maintain homeostasis, glucocorticoids inhibit CRF and POMC
synthesis and secretion at the level of the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. It has previously been
shown that while nurr1 is constitutively expressed in
the PVN (8), nur77 mRNA is rapidly induced in this
region by stress (26) and interleukin-1b (27), both important regulators of hypothalamic CRF. Also, central
administration of CRF to conscious rats significantly
increases the expression of nur77 within the PVN (28).
We have shown that nurr1 and nur77 are both expressed in the anterior pituitary, the site of POMC
synthesis (8). Further, nur77 and nurr1 transcripts are
strongly induced by stress in the adrenal cortex (25).
The induction of nur77 in this region has been implicated in the transcriptional induction of the steroidogenic enzyme steroid-21a-hydroxylase (24), a ratelimiting enzyme in glucocorticoid synthesis. However,
recent reports reveal that nur77 null mutant mice display no abnormal functions of the HPA axis (29). The
absence of detectable phenotypic changes in the HPA
axis has been proposed to reflect a functional redundancy by nurr1 because levels of this mRNA, after
HPA axis stimulation, are compensatorily increased in
the adrenal gland of nur77 null mutant mice (29). Finally, our laboratory recently identified specific DNAbinding sites for nurr1 and nur77 in the proximal promoter region of the CRF and POMC genes that may
mediate nurr1 subfamily-dependent regulation of
these genes in the hypothalamus and pituitary, respectively (19).
The aim of this study was to examine the neuroendocrine regulation of the HPA axis by the nurr1 subfamily. We report here that, as predicted by our previous DNA-binding studies (19), nurr1 and nur77
interact specifically with the CRF (2352/2332) and
POMC (270/247) promoter elements in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Cotransfection
experiments in pituitary-derived cells show that nurr1
can increase the transcriptional activity of both promoters. Further, mutational analysis of the nurr1 consensus site within the POMC promoter results in loss
of nurr1-stimulated expression. CRF functions through
the secondary messenger cAMP to potently stimulate
POMC gene transcription within pituitary cells. By increasing cAMP levels within a pituitary cell line, we
observe a rapid and robust increase of nurr1 and
nur77 mRNAs, suggesting CRF induction of POMC
synthesis may be mediated through these transcription factors. Finally, examination of the nurr1 consensus sequence in the POMC promoter reveals that the
element overlaps with a well characterized negative
glucocorticoid receptor response element (nGRE). We
provide evidence to indicate that glucocorticoid repression of the POMC gene may be mediated, at least
in part, by glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent inhibition of activation of the POMC gene by nurr1 subfamily members. Our results strongly support the con-

clusion that the nurr1 subfamily of nuclear receptors
plays a coordinate role in neuroendocrine regulation of
the activity of the HPA axis.

RESULTS
Specific Binding of nurr1 and nur77 to Proximal
Promoter Fragments of the CRF and POMC
Genes
In a previous study, we identified three cis-acting
sequences, GAAGGTCA, AAAGGTCG, and GAAGGTCG (19), in addition to the previously characterized AAAGGTCA (NBRE) site (18), that bind specifically to both nurr1 and nur77. Examination of
Genbank for sequences containing one of these
sequences, GAAGGTCA, revealed several genes of
neuronal and neuroendocrine origin whose proximal
promoters contain this cis-acting sequence (19).
Two identified genes, ovine CRF (oCRF) (30) and rat
POMC (rPOMC) (31), were of particular interest
since previous analysis of the spatial expression of
nurr1 and nur77 within the central nervous system
indicated that nurr1 and nur77 are either expressed
or induced by HPA-activating signals in the hypothalamic and pituitary structures that express the
CRF and POMC genes (8, 26). The GAAGGTCA
sequence of the POMC is highly conserved across
the rat, human, and mouse species (31–33), suggesting this sequence has important regulatory
functions.
To test whether nurr1 and nur77 interact directly
with the POMC 270/247 and CRF 2352/2332 regions, we prepared 32P- labeled oligonucleotides containing these regions and used EMSA to examine their
binding to nurr1 and nur77 translated in vitro in the
reticulolysate system. The results of these assays are
shown in Fig. 1. Incubation with nurr1 resulted in a
retarded radiolabeled complex that was observed
when either the POMC (panel A, lane 2) or CRF (panel
C, lane 2) promoter fragments were used. These complexes were nurr1 dependent and were not observed
in the absence of nurr1 in the reticulolysate (lane 1,
both panels). Furthermore, complex formation on both
promoters was specifically inhibited by increasing
concentrations of unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide (lanes 3–5) but not by a heterologous oligonucleotide (lane 6), indicating that binding to these DNA
fragments was specific and competitive. Finally, mutation of the GAAGGTCA motif to GAACATCA or
GTACGTCA within these sequences resulted in loss of
ability to competitively inhibit nurr1-dependent binding, indicating that this sequence is essential for the
nurr1 interaction (lanes 7–9). Similar results were obtained when nur77 was used in EMSA instead of nurr1
(panels B and D).

Nurr1 (panels A and C) and nur77 (panels B and D) were transcribed and translated in vitro and incubated with a32P-labeled
rPOMC (panels A and B) and oCRF (panels C and D) oligonucleotides (lane 2). For competition analysis 10–503 molar excess
of homologous oligonucleotide (lanes 3–5), 503 molar excess of heterologous oligonucleotide (lane 6), and 10–503 molar excess
of mutant oligonucleotide (lanes 7–9) were used.

the CRF and POMC Promoter Regions

and may function redundantly to do so in a physiological context if coexpressed.

To determine whether nurr1 and nur77 were capable
of regulating the expression of the CRF and POMC
promoters, we generated target gene constructs
containing the proximal promoter regions of both
genes and used these in cotransfection experiments
with nurr1 or nur77 expression constructs. In these
experiments, we constructed target vectors in the
promoterless pBL3CAT plasmid (34) using a
2483/11 promoter fragment of the rPOMC gene
(31), a 2483/181 fragment of the human POMC
promoter (32), and a 2372/111 fragment of the
oCRF gene (30). Transcriptional regulation of these
target constructs by nurr1 and nur77 was then measured by transfection in the anterior pituitary corticotropic cell line, AtT20/D. As shown in Fig. 2A,
cotransfection of these target genes with nurr1 results in a 7- to 12-fold stimulation of the rat, human
POMC, and oCRF promoters over that observed
when the target genes are cotransfected with the
parent expression vector lacking nurr1 (p91023B).
To confirm that the nurr1-dependent induction transcription is due to the presence of the GAAGGTCA
motif within the promoter, we introduced point mutations within this element in the rPOMC promoter to
GAACATCA, which we have shown to result in loss
of nurr1 binding in vitro (Fig. 1), and we examined
the regulation of this promoter construct by nurr1.
As shown in Fig. 2B, nurr1 induction of the POMC
promoter is lost when the mutated promoter construct (rPOMC MT1) is used, indicating that a functional GAAGGTCA motif is essential for transcriptional induction of the POMC promoter by nurr1.
When nurr1 was replaced by nur77 in these assays,
similar results were observed (data not shown), indicating that both subfamily members can regulate
the expression of the CRF and POMC promoters

CRF Rapidly Induces nurr1 and nur77 Expression
in Pituitary Cells
To determine whether the nurr1/nur77 subfamily is
likely to contribute to the regulation of POMC expression by CRF in a physiological context, we incubated
isolated mouse pituitary cells with CRF (1028 M) and
examined its ability to induce expression of the nurr1
and nur77 transcripts. As indicated in Fig. 3, both
nurr1 and nur77 transcripts are rapidly induced by
CRF within 15 min of treatment and are maximal at
approximately 30 min. Further, this induction slightly
precedes the previously reported time course of
POMC transcription by CRF, which is maximal by
30–60 min (35, 36).
Forskolin Induces Expression of the p-483/11
rPOMC Reporter Construct
While AtT20/D cells are a suitable model to examine
the regulation of POMC in corticotropic cells, the
induction of POMC by CRF in these cells is very
weak and variable and most likely due to loss of
membrane CRF receptors in the transformed cell
line. However, since CRF-dependent regulation of
POMC expression is known to be mediated by the
secondary messenger cAMP pathway (37, 38), CRFdependent POMC induction can be mimicked by
incubation of cells with forskolin to activate this
pathway. Direct activation of adenylate cyclase with
forskolin induced both nurr1 and nur77 mRNAs rapidly (Fig. 4). The time course of this induction correlates with the time course of CRF induction of
nurr1 and nur77 in the isolated pituitary cells. Further, we show that forskolin can significantly stimulate the expression of the rPOMC-chloramphenicol

reduced when the nurr1 binding site is destroyed by
point mutation of the GAAGGTCA motif (rPOMC
MT1), and the basal activity of the promoter is also
decreased. Finally, when the GAAGGTCA alone is
placed in front of a heterologous promoter [thymidine kinase (tk) (34)], this enhancer element is sufficient to mediate induction of this promoter by forskolin (Fig. 4). The results confirm that the nurr1binding site plays an important role in the induction
of this promoter by cAMP pathways and also contributes to the basal activity of the POMC promoter
in pituitary cells.

Upon identification of the nurr1 enhancer element, we
noted that its location overlapped with a previously
characterized nGRE that mediates GR-regulated repression of the POMC promoter (39) (Fig. 5A). Mutation of the GAAGGTCA motif to GAACATCA has been
shown to convert the nGRE into a positive enhancer
element that mediates induction of the enhancer element by GR (40) when placed upstream of a heterologous basal promoter. In preliminary studies to test
the hypothesis that the nurr1-binding site is pivotal to
both positive regulation by nurr1 and negative feedback by GR, we confirm that forskolin regulation of the
POMC promoter is down-regulated by pretreatment
with dexamethasone (36) and that rPOMC-MT1, while
not responding to forskolin or nurr1, is up-regulated by
dexamethasone (Fig. 5B). These data predicted that
GR may inhibit expression of POMC in the pituitary, at
least in part, by either directly or indirectly inhibiting
binding of the nurr1 subfamily to the GAAGGTCA motif. To directly test this predication, we carried out
EMSA on nuclear extracts to examine the DNA-binding properties of nurr1 in forskolin- and dexamethasone-treated cells. The results are shown in Fig. 5C. In
unstimulated AtT20/D cells, two proteins, presumably
nurr1 and nur77, bound to the rPOMC 270/247 probe
(lane 1). Stimulation of the cells with 25 mM forskolin for
1 h resulted in significant increased binding of both
proteins to DNA (lane 4). Binding was inhibited by 253
molar excess of homologous oligonucleotide (lanes 2
and 5) but not by the oligonucleotide containing a
mutation of the nurr1-binding site rPOMC 270/
247MT1 (lanes 3 and 6). The larger protein complex
was selectively blocked by nurr1-specific antiserum

protein to the POMC promoter sequence. Further, as
predicted by our transactivation results, pretreatment
with dexamethasone inhibited binding of both proteins
to DNA and also diminished the basal DNA-binding
activity (lane 10). These results confirm that the nurr1binding site can play a pivotal role in both basal and
cAMP-mediated up-regulation of the POMC promoter
and its down-regulation by GRs.

DISCUSSION
We have provided substantial evidence to support the
conclusion that members of the nurr1 subfamily of
nuclear receptors play an important role in the coordinate neuroendocrine regulation of the activity of the
HPA axis as well as its negative feedback inhibition by
glucocorticoids. Using in vitro DNA binding and cell-

based transactivation assays in an anterior pituitary
cell line, we have demonstrated that nurr1 and nur77
can bind and regulate the expression of the CRF and
POMC promoters. To examine the physiological significance of this transcriptional regulation, we focused
on the POMC promoter for several reasons. First, the
proximal binding site for the nurr1 subfamily is positionally conserved across species in this promoter and
is contained in a region important for both positive and
negative regulation of the POMC gene (31, 40). Second, the POMC promoter fragment used in these stud-

ies contains all of the sequences (2323/234) that have
been shown to be necessary and sufficient for the
correct spatiotemporal and hormone-inducible expression of a b-galactosidase reporter gene in the
anterior pituitary when expressed in transgenic animals (41). Third, the availability of a well characterized
anterior pituitary-derived cell line (AtT20/D) (31), which
produces endogenous POMC and responds to cAMP
activation by induction of POMC expression in a manner that mimics induction by CRF, facilitates examination of the regulation of POMC by the nurr1 subfamily and the promoter elements responsible for this
regulation in a physiologically relevant context.
As predicted by the species conservation of the
nurr1-binding site, we confirmed that transactivation
of the POMC gene by nurr1 is conserved between rat
and human species. Further, we showed that mutation
of the nurr1-binding site within the POMC promoter
results in loss of ability to bind nurr1 and inhibits
nurr1-dependent activation of this promoter, confirming that the GAAGGTCA sequence motif is essential
for nurr1-dependent induction of POMC expression.
To determine whether nurr1 and/or nur77 are likely to
mediate CRF- dependent induction of POMC expression in the anterior pituitary, we confirmed that the
expression of both nurr1 and nur77 is rapidly induced
by stimulation of isolated mouse pituitary cells with
CRF. Further, we demonstrated that this induction can
be mimicked in AtT20/D cells by activation of cAMPdependent pathways by forskolin. Forskolin stimulation results in increased binding of endogenous nurr1
to DNA and a functional POMC-CAT transactivation
response. These data indicate that cAMP may regulate the POMC promoter, at least in part, by increasing
expression of the nurr1 subfamily. However, nur77 has
also been shown to be phosphorylated by cAMP (25),
and cAMP has also been shown to alter the transcriptional activity of nurr1 and nur77 (42). Thus, both covalent modification of existing pools of nur proteins
and de novo synthesis are likely to contribute to
cAMP-dependent induction of the POMC promoter.
The observation that forskolin induction of the
rPOMC-CAT target gene is diminished by mutation of
the nurr1-binding site illustrates the importance of this
cis-acting sequence in mediating cAMP-dependent
induction of POMC expression in the anterior pituitary
cell line. While CRF is known to induce expression of
POMC through a cAMP-dependent pathway, previous
studies have not uncovered a recognizable cis-acting
cAMP response element that may mediate this response (43). The location of cAMP-responsive sequences in the POMC promoter has therefore been
controversial. Previous studies have indicated that sequences located upstream (2236/2133) of the nurr1binding site are responsive to CRF when placed upstream of a heterologous promoter and may
contribute to hormonal regulation of the endogenous
gene (43). While our data support a major role for the
nurr1-binding site located at 260/270 in mediating
cAMP responses in the context of the endogenous

Vol 16 No. 1

POMC promoter, the lack of complete inhibition of
POMC induction by mutation of this sequence indicates that additional sequences outside of this region
may also contribute to cAMP-mediated induction of
expression of this gene.
The nurr1-binding site overlaps with a previously
identified nGRE that has been shown to be important
for GR-mediated repression of the POMC gene and is
also important for basal expression of this promoter
(31, 39, 40, 44). Consistent with the reported contribution of this region to basal promoter activity (44), we
observed that mutation of the nurr1-binding site also
results in decreased basal promoter activity. Two critical nucleotides within the nGRE are critical for both
GR repression (40) and nurr1 transactivation. Mutation
of these nucleotides, as we have done in our study
(POMC-MT1), converted the nGRE into a positive GR
response element when placed in front of a heterologous promoter (40). We have demonstrated that although this mutated sequence no longer responds to
nurr1 and demonstrates diminished response to forskolin, the mutant target gene is induced by dexamethasone. These data support the conclusion that the
nurr1-binding site plays an important role in negative
regulation of the POMC gene by glucocorticoids as
well as nurr1-mediated basal and cAMP-inducible expression of POMC. Further, we show that GR-mediated inhibition of the POMC gene is accompanied by
an inhibition of nurr1 subfamily-dependent DNA binding to the GAAGGTCA response element, demonstrating functional antagonism between these two nuclear
receptors. Thus, the nurr1 subfamily may play a pivotal
role in regulation of neuroendocrine homeostasis at
the pituitary level.
The data we have provided in the present study,
together with the demonstrated expression (8) and
induction (26–28) of nurr1 subfamily members in the
hypothalamic PVN, and the demonstration by others
(24) that nur77 can mediate the regulation of expression of the steroidogenic enzyme, steroid-21 a-hydroxylase by the POMC processing product, ACTH,
indicate that members of the nurr1 subfamily may be
important coordinators of the activity of the HPA axis
at all levels. Despite these observations, however, recent analysis of HPA activity in homozygous nur77 null
mutant mice has detected no disturbance in this neuroendocrine pathway (29). In fact, the only significant
difference between wild type and homozygous animals observed in this pathway was a compensatory
increase in the induction of nurr1 by stress in nur77
null mutant animals that was not observed in the wild
type mice (29). This observation highlights the capacity for redundancy of function between nurr1 subfamily
members. Our analysis of the comparative developmental expression of nurr1 and nur77 has indicated
that nurr1 is selectively expressed during embryonic
development, particularly in the diencephalic regions
that give rise to the hypothalamus at a time that coincides with the developmental organization of the
HPA axis, whereas nur77 is not expressed until the

postnatal stage (O. Saucedo-Cardenas and O. Conneely, manuscript in preparation). Given the ability of
nurr1 to substitute functionally for nur77, it is not surprising that nur77 null mutant mice do not show any
detectable aberrant phenotypes in the HPA because
nur77 expression does not begin until the postnatal
stage of development at a time when nurr1 is already
expressed. Thus, nurr1 may play a selective role in the
developmental organization and activity of the HPA
axis that is not substituted by nur77. Finally, the ontogeny and impact, if any, of the third subfamily member, NOR-1, on this pathway remain to be established.
With the use of gene-targeting strategies, null mutation of these genes in mice should provide valuable
insights into the selective and collective functions of
these proteins in vivo, including their essential role, if
any, in the neuroendocrine development and activity
of the HPA axis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmid Construction
The nurr1 and nur77 cDNAs were cloned into the plasmid
pT7b-6 Sal (45) at the NcoI site of the b-Globin linker and the
SalI site of the polylinker. This generated pT7b-nurr1 and
pT7b-nur77, which drives the expression of these cDNAs
under the control of the T7 promoter in vitro. For expression
in tissue culture cells, cDNAs were ligated to the EcoRI site of
p91023b and expressed under the control of the adenoviral
major late promoter (46). The reporter plasmid p-372CRFCAT was generated by PCR using, as the template, a 5-kb
BglII/HindIII fragment isolated from the previously identified l
CRF-1 genomic clone (30). p-483POMC-CAT reporters were
also generated by PCR using rat and human genomic DNA.
The PCR products were subcloned into pBL3CAT, which
lacks the minimal tk promoter (34). All PCR products were
sequenced by the dideoxy method (47). The M2G (GAAGGTCA)2 tk-CAT reporter plasmid was made by ligating double-stranded oligonucleotides, containing two inverted copies of the response element oligonucleotide separated by 10
nucleotides, into the BamHI site of pBL2CAT, upstream of the
minimal tk promoter (34).
In Vitro Transcription and Translation
In vitro transcription and translation was accomplished with
the TNT kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with the addition of
RNAsin (Promega). Nurr1 and nur77 were transcribed with T7
RNA polymerase from pT7b-6 recombinant plasmid (45), a
derivative of pGEM 2 in which the b-globin insert of pSP6 Hb
166 6 was inserted at the initiation codon to create the
sequence CCATGCCTCGACCATGG (48). The translation
was carried out in the presence of [35S]methionine and run on
an 8.5% denaturing gel or cold methionine for use in the
mobility shift assay, according to the manufacturers directions; 1–2.5 ml of a translation mixture was used in each gel
shift-binding reaction.
EMSA
EMSA were performed with in vitro translated proteins in a
rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (TNT, Promega) or AtT20/D
nuclear extracts. Proteins were mixed with 100,000 cpm of
Klenow-labeled probes in the reaction buffer, 20 mM HEPES,

45

pH 7.9, 5 mM MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM
EDTA, 8% Ficoll, 600 mM KCl, 500 ng/ml poly(deoxyinosinicdeoxycytidylic)acid, and 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). The reaction was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and
then electrophoresed through a 5.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.53 Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE) electrophoresis buffer. Nurr1-specific antiserum (8) was incubated with
nuclear extract for 15 min before the addition of probe. For
competition studies, the reaction was performed as described with the indicated concentrations of unlabeled probe.
The sequences of the oligonucleotides studied are listed as

Preparation of Nuclear Extracts
AtT20/D16V-F2 cells untreated or treated with 25 mM forskolin were washed with cold PBS, resuspended, and incubated
for 5 min in 0.25 ml buffer A (10 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 1.5
mM MgCL2, 10 mM KCL, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM
phenylmethylsulfonylfluroide, and 2 mg each of the protease
inhibitors antipain, pepstatin A, and aprotinin per ml). Then,
1.25 ml of 10% Nonidet P-40 were added, and the cells were
incubated for 2 min on ice. The cells were centrifuged at low
speed (1,7000 rpm), and the supernatant was removed (cytosolic fraction). To the pellet, 0.125 ml of buffer B (0.4 M
NaCL, 10 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM
EGTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride) was added. The mixture was vortexed at 4 C
and left on ice for 5 min. The extracts were then centrifuged,
and the supernatant was dialyzed against 50 volumes of
buffer C (20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 75 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM
EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride) for 4 h at 4 C with one change of buffer C.
After 4 h, the materials that precipitated during dialysis were
removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at 280°C until
further use. The protein concentration was estimated with the
Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). One
microgram of protein was used in the EMSA.
Cell Culture and Transfection
AtT20/D16V-F2 were grown in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS, penicillin at 100 mg/ml, and streptomycin at 100
mg/ml in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air.
Twenty four hours before transfection, 2 3 105 cells were
plated in 3-cm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS
and were allowed to attach. The cells were then washed with
Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) lacking calcium and
magnesium and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10%
horse serum for AtT20/D cells. Cells treated with forskolin (25
mM) or dexamethasone (1028 M) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% stripped serum. DNA (50–100 ng
p91023-nurr1/nur77; 0.5–1 mg p-372CRF CAT and
p-483POMC CAT; 200 ng M2G-tk CAT) in a volume of 250 ml
HEPES-buffered saline was added to 1 3 1010 d1312 adenovirus particles (49) in a volume of 333 ml HEPES-buffered
saline and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. PolyL-lysine was added (the amount required was based on the
size of the DNA used) and incubated at room temperature for
30 min. The DNA-modified virus-poly-L-lysine was added to
the cells and incubated for 2 h at 37 C. The virus-containing
medium was removed, and 3 ml of specific medium were
added to the cells. The cells were incubated at 37 C for 24 h

before harvesting. Pituitaries from adult mice (BALB/c) were
rapidly isolated intact. Four whole pituitaries were pooled per
sample and collected in DMEM containing 10% stripped
serum and equilibrated in a 95% air-5% CO2 mixture.
Northern Blot
Total RNA from cultured cells was isolated at specific times
after treatment. RNA was quantitated by UV absorption, and
20 mg of total RNA were electrophoresed on a standard
Northern gel and transferred to nylon membrane (50). Nurr1
and nur77 cDNA probes spanned the amino-terminal region
to avoid cross-hybridization. All membranes were probed
under high stringency conditions.
CAT Assay
Each plate of cells was washed once with PBS without calcium and magnesium, scraped into 1 ml TEN buffer (40 mM
Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and collected by
centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 sec. Cells were resuspended in 250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and lysed by four freeze/
thaw cycles. Protein concentrations were determined by the
micro-plate Bradford assay (51). CAT activity was determined
by incubating 5–10 mg protein with 0.2 mCi [3H]chloramphenicol (20 mCi/mmol) and 250 mM butryl-Coenzyme A in 100 ml
250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 3 h at 37 C. Acylated chloramphenicol was extracted using a mixture of 200 ml 2:1
2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane and Xylenes and counted
in a scintillation counter (52). The background of the CAT
activity ranges from 300–500 cpm and has been subtracted
from the assay. Therefore, 1000 cpm represents a low but
significant level of basal activity.
