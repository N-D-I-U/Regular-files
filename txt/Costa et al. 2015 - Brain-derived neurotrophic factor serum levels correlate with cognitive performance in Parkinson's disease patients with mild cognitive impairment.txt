Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a trophic factor regulating cell survival
and synaptic plasticity. Recent findings indicate that BDNF could be a potential
regulatory factor for cognitive functioning in normal and/or neuropathological conditions.
With regard to neurological disorders, recent data suggest that individuals with
Parkinson’s disease (PD) may be affected by cognitive deficits and that they have
altered BDNF production. Therefore, the hypothesis can be advanced that BDNF
levels are associated with the cognitive state of these patients. With this in mind,
the present study was aimed at exploring the relationship between BDNF serum
levels and cognitive functioning in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Thirteen PD patients with MCI were included in the study. They were administered
an extensive neuropsychological test battery that investigated executive, episodic
memory, attention, visual-spatial and language domains. A single score was obtained
for each cognitive domain by averaging z-scores on tests belonging to that specific
domain. BDNF serum levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA).
Pearson’s correlation analyses were performed between BDNF serum levels and
cognitive performance. Results showed a significant positive correlation between
BDNF serum levels and both attention (p < 0.05) and executive (p < 0.05)
domains. Moreover, in the executive domain we found a significant correlation
between BDNF levels and scores on tests assessing working memory and selfmonitoring/inhibition. These preliminary data suggest that BDNF serum levels are
associated with cognitive state in PD patients with MCI. Given the role of BDNF
in regulating synaptic plasticity, the present findings give further support to the
hypothesis that this trophic factor may be a potential biomarker for evaluating
cognitive changes in PD and other neurological syndromes associated with cognitive
decline.

BDNF and cognition in Parkinson’s disease

Introduction

cell loss within the substantia nigra that causes a precocious
deafferentation of the nigro-striatal dopamine pathway with later
involvement of the meso-cortical and mesolimbic dopamine
pathways (Yeterian and Pandya, 1991; Jahanshahi et al., 2010).
Thus, in addition to motor disorders PD patients may also
present cognitive deficits including mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) and dementia (Robbins and Cools, 2014). Typically PD
patients with cognitive deficits have a dysexecutive profile that is
characterized by poor performance on tests tapping shifting and
planning (Cools, 2006; Cools and D’Esposito, 2011; MacDonald
and Monchi, 2011), working memory (Cools, 2006; Cools and
D’Esposito, 2011) and free recall of studied information (Costa
et al., 2014a). As stated before, BDNF is a trophic factor
for the dopaminergic neurons of these brain regions. Indeed,
many studies have shown that PD patients show decreased
BDNF levels in the substantia nigra (pars compacta; Howells
et al., 2000) and in serum (Scalzo et al., 2010). Moreover,
BDNF serum concentration was associated to the level of
dopamine transporter binding in the striatum (Ziebell et al.,
2012).
Studies on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD patients revealed
an association between BDNF and cognitive performance
(Leverenz et al., 2011) and increased BDNF levels compared
with controls (Salehi and Mashayekhi, 2009). Moreover, CSF
BDNF levels were found to be reduced in PD patients with
major depression (MD) as compared to solely depressed patients
after treatment with antidepressants (citalopram; Pålhagen et al.,
2010). Despite these studies, the role of CSF BDNF levels as
biomarker in PD needs to be replicated according to more strictly
diagnostic standardized criteria and in longer follow- up periods
(Jiménez-Jiménez et al., 2014).
Altogether these findings suggest that BDNF serum levels may
not only be a trait that characterizes dopaminergic dysfunctions
in PD patients but could also be a potential biomarker of
their cognitive deficits. To test this hypothesis, we performed
a pilot study with a groups of individuals with PD and MCI,
in which we assessed BDNF serum levels and correlated them
with scores obtained on tests measuring episodic memory,
language, attention, executive and visual-spatial functions. Since
in humans BDNF has been reported to correlate with specific
components of the executive domain that are precociously
weakened in PD (Koven and Collins, 2014), we expected to find
a significant association between BDNF serum levels and PD
patients’ performance on executive tests.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) belongs to the family
of neurotrophins that regulate the survival and functioning
of neurons in the central nervous system (Baydyuk and Xu,
2014). BDNF was originally described as a trophic factor for
dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (Hyman et al.,
1991). However, successive studies found that its action on
neurons is not only trophic but involves the regulation of
synaptic plasticity through the activation of signal transduction
pathways that influence the release of neurotransmitters such as
glutamate and GABA (Gottmann et al., 2009). These effects on
synaptic transmission have been associated with the long-term
potentiation that takes place in the hippocampus during learning
and memory processes (Leal et al., 2014). Thus, BDNF not only
has a trophic action but also the potential to regulate cognitive
processes.
In recent years, the latter role of BDNF was confirmed in
both animal and human studies. In rodent models, it was shown
that knockout of the BDNF gene affects spatial learning and
memory (Gorski et al., 2003; Monteggia et al., 2004; Heldt
et al., 2007), whereas transgenic overexpression of BDNF in
cortical and subcortical (i.e., hippocampus) regions sustains
performance (Koponen et al., 2004). Li et al. (2012) also
documented that, in cognitively affected rats, BDNF infusion
into the nucleus accumbens improved cognition, synaptic
plasticity and cell signaling. As for human data, in both
healthy individuals (Alfimova et al., 2012) and in persons
with psychiatric disturbances (Lu et al., 2012; Tükel et al.,
2012), BDNF gene polymorphism (Val66Met) was found to be
associated with executive dysfunctions. In a sample of more
than 50 healthy young subjects, Koven and Collins (2014)
recently documented a significant correlation between (urinary)
BDNF concentration and cognitive performance on tests tapping
cognitive flexibility (i.e., Trail Making Test, Design Fluency
and Verbal Category Switching). Nonetheless the role of BDNF
gene polymorphism in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is not well
defined and the results are sometimes contradictory. While
some authors report an association between gene polymorphism
with cognitive impairments in PD patients (Foltynie et al.,
2005; Guerini et al., 2009) or with the onset of the disease
(Karamohamed et al., 2005), other studies do not show such
correlations (Dai et al., 2013; Svetel et al., 2013; Białecka
et al., 2014). Many of these studies however are not strictly
comparable in term of disease stages and the methodology used
to assess cognitive impairments (Alonso-Navarro et al., 2014;
Białecka et al., 2014). Thus, the results do not permit definitive
conclusions. Larger sample-size and multiethnicity studies with
homogeneous PD patients and well-matched controls are needed
in the future study.
Above data indicate that BDNF could be a potential
regulatory factor for cognitive functioning in normal and/or
neuropathological conditions. Among the neurological disorders
affected by cognitive deficits, PD is interesting because the
neuronal pathways affected are involved in some cognitive
functions that respond to the action of BDNF (Murer et al., 2001;
Guillin et al., 2003). In fact, PD is characterized by dopamine

Materials and Methods
Patients
We recruited 13 right-handed subjects with idiopathic PD who
gave their written informed consent. The study was approved
by Ethics Committee of the Santa Lucia Foundation. The United
Kingdom PD Society brain bank criteria were used to diagnosis
PD (Hughes et al., 1992).
MCI was diagnosed according to the criteria of Litvan
et al. (2012). Accordingly, to be included PD subjects patients
have a performance that was 1.5 SD below the average

performance from the average performance of the normal
population on at least one neuropsychological test investigating
executive abilities and on another test sensitive to short-term
memory/attention, visual-spatial abilities, episodic memory and
language (the neuropsychological test battery is described below).
The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; Folstein et al.,
1975) score had to be ≥26. In order to exclude psychiatric
diseases, neurological conditions other than PD, vascular
brain damage and major systemic or metabolic pathologies
that could influence cognitive performance, we performed
neuropsychiatric, neuroradiological (CT or MR) and laboratory
examinations.
In order to assess functional abilities in daily living and
their relationship with cognitive functioning we administered
the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale, the Instrumental Activities
of Daily Living scale (Lawton and Brody, 1969) and the Pill
questionnaire (Dubois et al., 2007). Severity of depressive
and apathy symptoms was also assessed by administering
the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck et al., 1961; Visser
et al., 2009) and the Apathy Evaluation Scale—self version
(Marin et al., 1991; Leentjens et al., 2008), respectively. PD
patients were being treated with levodopa and/or dopamine
agonists (ropinirole, pramipexole and rotigotine) during
examination period. The levodopa equivalent and the clinical
and sociodemographic characteristics of the group are reported
in Table 1. Twenty healthy controls (HC) were also recruited.
Inclusion criteria for HC were: (i) absence of subjective
cognitive deficits and (ii) MMSE score ≥26 (Folstein et al.,
1975). Exclusion criteria were: (i) performance 1.5 SD below
the normative population on any test of the standardized
neuropsychological screening battery; (ii) current or previous
neurological or psychiatric disorders, major systemic or
metabolic diseases that could potentially affect cognitive
functioning; and (iii) taking medications that have an effect on
brain functioning. HC were only administered the behavioral
tests.

Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals
participating to the study are reported in Table 1.

Neuropsychological Test Battery
The following neuropsychological tests were administered to
subjects according to the domain they assess: (a) Episodic
memory: Immediate and Delayed Recall of a 15-Word List
(Carlesimo et al., 1996); Prose Recall (Carlesimo et al., 2002);
Immediate and delayed reproduction of Rey’s Figure (Carlesimo
et al., 2002); (b) Attention and short-term memory: Digit
Span and Corsi Block Tapping test Forward and Backward
(Monaco et al., 2013); Trail Making Test -Part A (Giovagnoli
et al., 1996); (c) Executive functions: Phonological Word
Fluency (Carlesimo et al., 1996); Modified Card Sorting test
(MCST; Nocentini et al., 2002); Raven’s Coloured Progressive
Matrices (Carlesimo et al., 1996); Trail Making Test—Part B
(Giovagnoli et al., 1996); (d) Language: Objects and Verbs
Naming subtests from the Neuropsychological Examination of
Aphasia (Capasso and Miceli, 2001); and (e) Visual-spatial
functions: Copy of Drawings and Copy of Drawings with
Landmarks (Carlesimo et al., 1996); Copy of Rey’s Figure
(Carlesimo et al., 2002).
Additional tests were administered to assess executive
functioning according to the ability they investigated: Zoo
Map test (Wilson et al., 1998; planning and self-monitoring),
Stroop test (Barbarotto et al., 1998; response inhibition and
self-monitoring), Alternate Phonemic and Category fluency
(Cognitive Flexibility/shifting) and Category Fluency (Costa
et al., 2014c).
In order to standardize the measurement scales between the
different tests, raw scores were transformed into z-scores by
considering the means and standard deviations of the HC group.
First, a unique z-score was computed for each cognitive
domain (i.e., episodic memory, attention and short-term
memory, executive functions, language and visual-spatial
domains) by averaging subjects’ z-scores on tests belonging to
that specific domain.
Following Koven and Collins (2014), to investigate
the possible correlation between BDNF levels and
specific components of the executive domain (abstract
reasoning/planning,
self-monitoring/response
inhibition,
cognitive flexibility, fluency and working memory), individual
z-scores were computed for each executive component by
averaging the subjects’ z-scores on the relative tests. Thus, an
individual score was obtained for abstract reasoning/planning
(total accuracy score on the Zoo Map Test; number of categories
achieved on the MCST; accuracy score on the Progressive
Matrices), Self-monitoring/Response inhibition (Errors made
on the Zoo Map Test; errors made and response times on
interference condition of the Stroop test), Cognitive Flexibility
(perseverative errors committed on the MCST; accuracy
score on Alternate Phonemic and Semantic fluency; Trail
Making Test Part B-Part A score), Fluency (Phonemic
and Semantic fluency), and Working memory (Digit and
Corsi span backward). All z-scores were considered as
absolute values so that higher scores corresponded to better
performance.

all cases). By contrast, in the language domain the between group
difference only approached statistical significance (F (1,33) = 3.44;
p = 0.073).

Blood samples were collected between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.,
centrifuged at 2000×g for 20 min and stored at −80◦ C until
analysis (Angelucci et al., 2015).

Correlation Between BDNF Serum Levels and PD
Patients’ Cognitive Scores
Analysis Involving the Five Main Cognitive Domains

Determination of BDNF Content
BDNF was detected in sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay
(ELISA; R&D Systems, USA; cat. N◦ DY248) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions as previously described (Angelucci
et al., 2015). Wells were developed with tetramethylbenzidine
and measured at 450/570 nm and BDNF content was quantified
against a standard curve calibrated with known amounts
of protein. The detection limit for BDNF was 15 pg/ml.
Measurements were performed in duplicate and values are
expressed as ng/ml. Cross-reactivity with other related trophic
factors (NGF, NT-3; NT-4; TGFβ, TGFα) was less than 3%
(Angelucci et al., 2015).

Results of Pearson’s r correlation analyses showed a significant
positive correlation between BDNF serum levels and PD
patients’ z-scores in the executive (r = 0.62; p = 0.023) and
attention (r = 0.59; p = 0.032) domains. This indicates that
better scores on the above tests were associated with a higher
concentration of BDNF. The effects related to analyses involving
the remaining three cognitive domains did not reach statistical
significance (episodic memory: r = −0.27; p = 0.36; visualspatial domain: r = 0.33; p = 0.26; language domain: r = −0.05;
p = 0.88).

Statistical Analysis
In order to compare PD patients’ and HCs’ scores on the
five main cognitive domains (episodic memory, attention and
short-term memory, executive functions, language, visual-spatial
functions), a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and
individual univariate ANOVAS were carried out.
Pearson’s r correlations were performed to examine the
relationship between BDNF serum levels and z-scores obtained
by PD patients in the different cognitive domains examined.
The same statistical analysis was used to examine the
correlation between BDNF serum levels and PD patients’
z-scores on the different executive components.

Analyses Involving the Different Components of
the Executive Domain

Results

This study investigated the association between cognitive
functioning and BDNF serum level in PD patients with MCI. For
this purpose, we administered an extensive neuropsychological
battery to a sample of PD patients including tests for
the assessment of episodic memory, executive functions,
attention, language and visual-spatial abilities. The results
showed a positive association between BDNF serum levels and
performance on neuropsychological tests investigating executive
functioning and attention. Moreover, other analyses focusing
on the different components of the executive domain showed a

A significant positive correlation was found between BDNF levels
and z-scores referring to self-monitoring/response inhibition
(r = 0.68; p = 0.011) and working memory (r = 0.62; p = 0.025)
performance, indicating that higher BDNF levels were associated
with better cognitive performance. The remaining analyses
showed no significant effects (Planning/Abstraction: r = 0.48;
p = 0.098; shifting: r = 0.41; p = 0.17; Fluency: r = 0.06; p = 0.85).

Discussion

Comparisons Between PD Patients and Healthy
Controls
The z-scores obtained by the experimental subjects are illustrated
in Figure 1. The MANOVA showed a significant effect
(F (5,27) = 9.64; p < 0.001). Subsequent univariate analyses showed
that PD patients obtained significantly lower z-scores than HC in
the cognitive domains of memory, executive functions, attention
and visual-spatial abilities (F (1,33) range: 17.1–32.5; p < 0.001 in

BDNF and cognition in Parkinson’s disease

closer association between BDNF levels and working memory
and self-monitoring/inhibition.
Our results are congruent with previous data reported in
both animal and human studies that documented an association
between BDNF-related activity and cognitive functioning (Koven
and Collins, 2014; Robbins and Cools, 2014), particularly
with data suggesting a specific association with abilities in
the executive system domain (Gajewski et al., 2011; Alfimova
et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2012; Tükel et al., 2012; Koven and
Collins, 2014). In fact, molecular studies reported that the
BDNF gene polymorphism (Val66Met) may affect executive
functions in healthy subjects (Alfimova et al., 2012) and in
patients with psychiatric disturbances (Lu et al., 2012; Tükel
et al., 2012). Very interestingly, Koven and Collins (2014),
who adopted a design similar to ours, recently documented a
significant relationship in healthy subjects between (urinary)
BDNF concentration and performance on executive tests. These
authors examined a sample of more than 50 healthy young
subjects who were administered a neuropsychological test battery
investigating different subcomponents of the executive system.
Adopting a correlational design, they demonstrated that subjects’
performance on tests tapping cognitive flexibility (i.e., Trail
Making Test, Design Fluency and Verbal Category Switching)
was positively associated with BDNF urinary concentrations.
Our results differed from those of Koven and Collins in that
we did not find a specific association between BDNF and setshifting (although the relative correlation was in the expected
direction). In fact, BDNF serum concentration correlated with
the executive scores of working memory, self-monitoring and
abstraction/planning. The imperfect congruence between our
results and those of Koven and Collins’ study is likely due to
differences in the recruited samples. Indeed, the participants
in Koven and Collins’ study were healthy young individuals.
Instead, our sample consisted of PD patients with a known
cognitive weakness (i.e., MCI with a predominantly dysexecutive
and amnestic neuropsychological profile).
BDNF plays a role in the promotion of the survival and
function of striatal dopaminergic neurons and in regulating
synaptic connectivity (Gómez-Palacio-Schjetnan and Escobar,
2013; He et al., 2013). Other studies have shown that BDNF
brain and peripheral levels are decreased in PD patients as
compared to HC (Scalzo et al., 2010). Moreover, Gyárfás
et al. (2010) demonstrated that treatment with antiparkinsonian
drugs may rise BDNF levels. As previously mentioned,
PD is characterized by altered functioning of the brain
dopamine systems, which involve the nigro-striatal, mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways (Robbins and Cools, 2014).
More specifically, dopamine deafferentation primarily involves
the nigro-dorsal striatum pathways and dopamine projections
to the dorsal prefrontal cortex (Baydyuk and Xu, 2014). In
this regard, it has been hypothesised that in the early stages
of PD dopamine altered activity is associated with cognitive
weakness due to the regional distribution of dopamine receptor
dysfunctioning (Cools and D’Esposito, 2011). In fact, dopamine
depletion has an early effect on the striatal regions that are
rich with D2 receptors, whose phasic activity is important for
sustaining cognitive flexibility processes (Camps et al., 1990;

Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

Yeterian and Pandya, 1991; Agid et al., 1993; MacDonald and
Monchi, 2011). Only later it involves the dorsal prefrontal
cortex where tonic D1 activity sustains the ability to retain
stable representations in the face of incoming information
(i.e., resistance to interference, self-monitoring; Cohen et al.,
2002; Frank, 2005; Costa et al., 2009, 2014b; Cools and
D’Esposito, 2011). In fact, weakness of the executive system
is a frequent and precocious finding in PD (Dirnberger and
Jahanshahi, 2013). Therefore, our finding of a significant
correlation between BDNF serum levels and prefrontal-related
cognitive performance, although preliminarily, supports the
hypothesis that BDNF activity contributes to maintaining
normal prefrontal cortex functioning (Savitz et al., 2006;
Woo and Lu, 2006; Galloway et al., 2008). In addition,
the data presented here, together with the observation that
BDNF is reduced in the brain and in the serum of PD
patients, could suggest that the measurement of BDNF in
serum may be used as a biological correlate of cognitive
as well as motor functioning. The fact that BDNF levels
positively correlate with performance on neuropsychological
tests is encouraging. Although we demonstrated in a previous
work that a cognitive rehabilitation protocol was able to
increase BDNF serum levels and cognitive functions in PD
patients affected by MCI, we did not find a significant
correlation between the biological and neuropsychological data
(Angelucci et al., 2015). As the number of patients was
even smaller (7/8 patients per group) and only one measure
of executive functioning was used, we can speculate that
the lack of correlation in that study could have been due
to both insufficient sample size and low sensitivity of the
cognitive measure used to measure executive dysfunction in
these patients.
Nonetheless, some limitations should be taken into account
in the interpretation of our data. The study is limited by the
poor sample size. Furthermore, we are merely describing an
association between BDNF serum and cognitive performance
and not a causal relationship. PD is now considered a multisystemic neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a
combination of motor and non-motor symptoms (Stacy, 2011).
For a long time the main clinical focus in PD has been on the
motor symptoms resulting from degeneration of the substantia
nigra and the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway, but there is
increasing recognition that other brain areas are involved in
the manifestation of non motor symptoms (Rana et al., 2015)
including the cerebral cortex (Lindenbach and Bishop, 2013),
brainstem (Greene, 2014) and peripheral nervous system (Conte
et al., 2013). Thus, alterations of BDNF brain and peripheral
levels may occur in response to other deficits in these PD
associated brain areas. This may limit the possibility to use BDNF
as a possible marker of PD cognitive disturbances. Future studies,
such as those using PET (Positron Emission Tomography), are
needed to establish a direct correlation between dopaminergic
denervation and BDNF.
In conclusion, this study shows that BDNF serum levels
correlate positively with performance on neuropsychological
tests investigating executive functioning and attention. These
findings support the idea that this protein may represent a
