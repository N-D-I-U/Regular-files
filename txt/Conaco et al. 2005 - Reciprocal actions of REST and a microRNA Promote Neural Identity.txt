MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in both tissue differentiation
and maintenance of tissue identity. In most cases, however, the
mechanisms underlying their regulation are not known. One brainspecific miRNA, miR-124a, decreases the levels of hundreds of
nonneuronal transcripts, such that its introduction into HeLa cells
promotes a neuronal-like mRNA profile. The transcriptional repressor, RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST), has a reciprocal
activity, inhibiting the expression of neuronal genes in nonneuronal cells. Here, we show that REST regulates the expression of a
family of miRNAs, including brain-specific miR-124a. In nonneuronal cells and neural progenitors, REST inhibits miR-124a expression,
allowing the persistence of nonneuronal transcripts. As progenitors differentiate into mature neurons, REST leaves miR-124a gene
loci, and nonneuronal transcripts are degraded selectively. Thus,
the combined transcriptional and posttranscriptional consequences of REST action maximize the contrast between neuronal
and nonneuronal cell phenotypes.

eneration of cellular diversity during development requires
coordination of gene expression mediated by both positive
and negative transcriptional regulators. In neuronal development, inhibitory pathways have been shown to play a particularly
important role (1, 2). Many neuronal genes are actively repressed
in nonneuronal cells through a conserved 23-bp repressor element (RE1) that interacts with a zinc-finger protein known as
the RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST兾NRSF) (3, 4).
REST mediates silencing of its target genes through the recruitment of histone deacetylases by corepressors associated with its
repressor domains (5–8). During the transition from pluripotent
cell to postmitotic neuron, REST is down-regulated, allowing
genes encoding fundamental neuronal traits to be expressed (9).
The extent to which REST contributes to mechanisms underlying other types of cellular specificity is not well established,
although it has been shown recently to be a tumor suppressor in
epithelial cells (10).
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are also excellent candidates for regulating cellular phenotype. These small, highly conserved regulatory molecules modulate gene expression posttranscriptionally by targeting mRNAs for translational repression or
degradation (11–13). miRNAs are produced from larger primary
transcripts originating from distinct genes (14). The primary
transcript is subjected to two processing steps, generating first a
stem-loop precursor transcript that is exported to the cytoplasm
and subsequently the ⬇21- to 23-nt mature miRNA. One strand
of the mature miRNA is preferentially incorporated into the
RNA-induced silencing complex. This effector complex then is
guided by the miRNA to target mRNAs bearing miRNA recognition elements in their 3⬘UTR (11–14). Since their discovery,
miRNAs have been shown to play important roles in diverse
biological processes, including developmental timing and patterning in Caenorhabditis elegans (15–21), apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster (22–24), and insulin secretion of pancreatic islet
cells (25). Evidence also supports the idea that miRNAs may be
important during late vertebrate development (26, 27), particularly for lineage differentiation of various tissue types (28–30).

Although recent studies are starting to unravel how miRNAs
fit into signaling pathways that govern cell fate decisions, the
factors that control miRNA expression and their precise roles
during the acquisition of a specific cell phenotype are just
beginning to become elucidated. During cardiogenesis, for
example, serum response factor induces the expression of
muscle-specific miRNA, miR-1, which in turn controls cardiomyocyte proliferation by down-regulating the Hand2 transcription factor (30). Establishment of the left–right asymmetry of chemosensory neurons in C. elegans also involves a
signaling network of transcription factors and miRNAs (19 –
20). In the mammalian nervous system, where cellular diversity
is extreme, the factors responsible for miRNA gene regulation
are only just emerging (31).
Here, we show that REST regulates a family of mouse miRNA
genes by transcriptional repression. One of the target miRNAs,
miR-124a, is known to be expressed to high levels throughout the
mature nervous system. We show that similar to canonical
REST-regulated genes, miR-124a is expressed as a result of the
dismissal of REST from its binding sites on the chromatin during
neuronal differentiation. Blocking miR-124a activity in mature
neurons leads selectively to increased levels of nonneuronal
transcripts. Our findings reveal that the establishment and
maintenance of neuronal identity requires both derepression of
REST-regulated genes as well as posttranscriptional downregulation of nonneuronal transcripts by a miRNA that is also
under REST control.
Results
A Family of Mouse miRNAs Contains Functional REST-Binding Sites.

Serial analysis of chromatin occupancy (SACO) is an unbiased
method for identifying functional transcription factor-binding
sites genome-wide (32). By using this method for identifying
REST-binding sites in a nonneuronal murine kidney cell line
(TCMK1), we discovered a family of mouse miRNA genes that
reside in close proximity to binding sites for the transcriptional
repressor, REST (Fig. 1A; see also Table 1, which is published
as supporting information on the PNAS web site). This family
includes miR-9-1, -9-2, -9-3, -124a-1, -124a-2, -124a-3, and -132,
all of which are expressed in brain (33–39). Each of the miR-9
gene loci gives rise to two mature miRNAs, miR-9 and -9*,
whereas the three miR-124a loci give rise to only one mature
miRNA, miR-124a. Both miR-9 and -9*, as well as miR-124a, are
highly enriched throughout the brain and are up-regulated
during rat brain corticogenesis (34) and during neuronal differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells (36). In contrast, the

product of the miR-132 gene is expressed at a lower level and is
restricted to particular areas in the brain (39).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis in kidney
cells verified that REST occupied the RE1 sites associated with
each of the SACO-identified miRNA genes (Fig. 1 A). Evidence
that REST regulates the expression of these miRNAs was
provided initially by the introduction of a dominant negative
form of REST (dnREST), which contains the DNA-binding
domain but lacks repressor domains, into mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) by adenoviral transduction. Quantitative
PCR was used to measure the expression level of each miRNA.
With the exception of miR-124a, for which it was possible to
design a single primer set that could detect the transcripts from
all three loci, primers for the other miRNA genes were designed
to detect each unique precursor transcript. Expression of
dnREST resulted in an increase in endogenous transcript levels
for miR-9, -124a, and -132 (Fig. 1B), an induction comparable
with that seen with other REST-regulated genes (9, 40–42).
Consistent with their regulation in MEFs, the ectopic expression
of REST in cortical neurons that do not express this transcriptional repressor resulted in a decrease in the steady RNA levels
of miR-9 and -124a after 24 h (Fig. 1C) and miR-132 after 48 h
(data not shown).

striction to the nervous system. Vertebrate genomes possess
three highly conserved miR-124a genes, whereas invertebrates
only have one. The single miR-124 gene in the invertebrates C.
elegans and D. melanogaster gives rise to a mature miRNA of the
same sequence as vertebrate miR-124a, although their precursor
transcripts differ at several nucleotides (Fig. 2A). Interestingly,
although invertebrates possess a miR-124 gene, they appear to
lack REST. However, Dallman et al. (43) have shown previously
in flies that REST may be replaced functionally by the transcriptional repressor, Tramtrack 88 (ttk88). Consistent with this
finding, a consensus ttk88 binding site is present in the promoter
region of the single locus encoding miR-124 in D. melanogaster.
In the mouse, the miR-124a genes (miR-124a-1, -124a-2, and
-124a-3) are located on chromosomes 14, 3, and 2, respectively
(Fig. 2B). Each miR-124a locus is associated with either ESTs or
annotated mRNAs. However, these mRNAs do not code for any
known proteins, suggesting that they may be part of the primary
miRNA transcript. Active transcription at all three miR-124a
loci could explain the abundance of this miRNA in neuronal
tissues.
We examined the expression of REST protein and mature
miR-124a in mouse embryonal carcinoma (P19) cells undergoing
neuronal differentiation in response to retinoic acid (Fig. 3A).
Differentiation was monitored by the appearance of the neuronal marker, neuronal ␤III-tubulin (TuJ1). The expression of
mature miR-124a at 4 days after retinoic acid treatment coincided with the disappearance of REST protein and terminal
differentiation, as evidenced by the expression of TuJ1. In
contrast, expression levels of the REST corepressor, CoREST,
which is expressed in both neural progenitors and mature
neurons (9), were independent of changes in REST levels. The
reciprocity of REST and miR-124 gene expression during P19
differentiation was accounted for by changes in the occupancy of
REST on the chromatin. ChIP analysis (Fig. 3B Left) showed
that REST occupied the RE1 sites of miR-124a-1, -124a-2, and
-124a-3, as well as the RE1 of the REST-regulated glutamic acid
decarboxylase (GAD1) gene, in primary cortical progenitors,
but was dismissed from the chromatin in mature cortical neurons. The dismissal of REST from the RE1 sites coincided with
the appearance of mature miR-124a, measured by ribonuclease
protection analysis, in cortical neurons; miR-124a was barely
detectable in the dividing cortical progenitors (Fig. 3B Right).
To determine that the repression of miR-124a was because of
REST bound specifically to the RE1 sites, a luciferase reporter
assay was performed in the murine kidney cell line TCMK1.
Luciferase reporter genes were constructed with flanking sequences containing the RE1 sites of miR-124a-3 or GAD1
cloned upstream of the thymidine kinase (TK) promoter that is
active in both neuronal and nonneuronal cell types (TK-miR124a-3 RE1, TK-GAD1 RE1). As predicted, luciferase activity
was lower for the constructs bearing the RE1 of miR-124a-3 or
GAD1 compared with constructs in which the RE1 site had been
deleted (TK-miR-124a-3 ⌬RE1, TK-GAD1 ⌬RE1) because of
the presence of endogenous REST protein in these cells (Fig.
3C). To confirm that binding of REST to the RE1s was
responsible for the lower activity, the cells were cotransfected
with the reporter and either dnREST or vector alone. Expression
of dnREST resulted in a doubling of luciferase activity for the
construct containing the miR-124a-3 RE1 and a 7-fold increase
in activity for the construct containing the RE1 of the canonical
REST-regulated gene, GAD1. Constructs lacking RE1 sites
were not affected by the presence of dnREST (Fig. 3D).

transcripts. Sequence analysis of the 3⬘UTR of these transcripts
revealed a preponderance of matches to the seed region (nucleotides 2–7) of miR-124a, suggesting that the miRNA was
directly targeting these mRNAs for degradation. One caveat of
this study, however, was that it was based exclusively on an
overexpression paradigm in cells in which miR-124a is not
normally expressed. To address this problem, we depleted
miR-124a from primary cultures of terminally differentiated
cortical neurons with antisense 2⬘-O-methyl (2⬘-OMe) oligoribonucleotides. Because of their resistance to ribonuclease cleavage, the irreversible binding of 2⬘-OMe oligoribonucleotides to
cognate miRNAs can efficiently inhibit interaction of the
miRNA with its mRNA targets (45). The mRNA levels for 17
nonneuronal transcripts identified in Lim et al. (44) were measured by quantitative PCR 48 h after 2⬘-OMe transfection into
neurons. A significant increase in transcript levels was observed
for 10 of these transcripts in miR-124a 2⬘-OMe-treated neurons
relative to neurons treated with an antisense 2⬘-OMe to a
muscle-specific miRNA, miR-1 (Fig. 4A). Transcript levels for
CoREST, a gene expressed abundantly in neurons, did not
change. Conversely, overexpression of miR-124a in MEFs resulted in a decrease in all 17 nonneuronal transcripts relative to
cells treated with miR-124a mut5–6, an inactive mutated version
of miR-124a (Fig. 4B).
Discussion
To date, regulation by REST has been ascribed largely to
neuronal genes that encode proteins expressed in most terminally differentiated neurons. Among these proteins are axon
guidance molecules, ion channels, synaptic vesicle proteins, and
neurotransmitter receptors (3, 4, 9, 40, 41, 46–57). The unbiased
SACO screen in a kidney cell line has now revealed that
noncoding miRNAs represent yet another set of target genes for

REST. Moreover, REST regulation of miR-124a is similar to
that of canonical REST-regulated neuronal genes. During neurogenesis, for example, REST repression is lost as REST is
dismissed from the RE1 sites on the miRNA chromatin.
In nonneuronal cells, the neuronal phenotype is suppressed by
REST repression of neuronal genes. This finding raises the
question of whether there is a reciprocal mechanism in neurons
for the suppression of nonneuronal genes. miR-124a is a good
candidate to mediate such a mechanism because its overexpression in HeLa cells and MEFs results in the selective downregulation of many nonneuronal transcripts (ref. 44 and Fig. 4B).
Moreover, as shown in this work, inhibition of miR-124a function
in neurons, where it is normally expressed, results in the selective
up-regulation of nonneuronal transcripts. This result provides
further support for the role of this miRNA as a constitutive
repressor of mRNAs encoding a large diversity of nonneuronal
proteins. Interestingly, however, not all of the transcripts downregulated by overexpression of miR-124a in nonneuronal cells
were affected by depletion of miR-124a in neurons (Fig. 4A).
Possible explanations for this outcome are as follows: (i) Overexpression causes off-target down-regulation of transcripts; (ii)
down-regulation of some transcripts in nonneuronal cells is an
indirect effect of direct targets of miR-124a, such as transcriptional activators or RNA binding proteins that may function to
stabilize nonneuronal transcripts; and (iii) in neurons, a single
nonneuronal mRNA may be regulated by multiple miRNAs such
that blocking miR-124a alone is not sufficient to cause upregulation. Further studies will be required to discriminate
among these possibilities.
On the basis of our results, and the work of Lim et al. (44), we
propose a simple model for how contrast, exemplified by distinct
mRNA profiles, is achieved between neuronal and nonneuronal
cell phenotypes (Fig. 4C). In nonneuronal cells, REST binds to

of nonneuronal transcripts mediated by miR-124a. Together,
these two events now alter the balance in favor of the neuronal
phenotype. The requirement for persistent down-regulation of
nonneuronal transcripts might seem uneconomical. In actuality,
however, the use of neuronal miRNAs to regulate mRNA
concentrations posttranscriptionally allows for basal transcription of these genes in neurons by the same transcription factors
and cognate genetic elements used in nonneuronal cells, an
economy of genomic function.
A large number of miRNAs are expressed during the progression of cortical development (33–38). It seems likely that
their distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns reflect specific
roles in coordinating the gene expression profiles that characterize neuronal subtypes. Indeed, a recent study in C. elegans has
revealed a dual miRNA circuit that regulates a terminal cell fate
decision between two distinct neuronal types (19). It remains to
be seen how the REST-regulated miRNAs, other than miR124a, function during mammalian nervous system development
or in the fine-tuning of neuronal functions.

quantitative real-time PCR as described above by using standard
curves generated from 10-fold serial dilutions of MEF cDNA
(see Data Set 1 for primer sequences). Statistical analyses were
performed as described above for quantitative PCR of miRNAs.
