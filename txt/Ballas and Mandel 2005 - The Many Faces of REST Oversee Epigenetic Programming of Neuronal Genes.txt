The many faces of REST oversee epigenetic programming of
neuronal genes
Nurit Ballas and Gail Mandel
Nervous system development relies on a complex signaling
network to engineer the orderly transitions that lead to the
acquisition of a neural cell fate. Progression from the nonneuronal pluripotent stem cell to a restricted neural lineage is
characterized by distinct patterns of gene expression,
particularly the restriction of neuronal gene expression to
neurons. Concurrently, cells outside the nervous system
acquire and maintain a non-neuronal fate that permanently
excludes expression of neuronal genes. Studies of the
transcriptional repressor REST, which regulates a large
network of neuronal genes, provide a paradigm for elucidating
the link between epigenetic mechanisms and neurogenesis.
REST orchestrates a set of epigenetic modifications that are
distinct between non-neuronal cells that give rise to neurons
and those that are destined to remain as nervous system
outsiders.

[4]. These requirements raise the fundamental question
of how neuronal gene chromatin is epigenetically programmed in different cellular contexts. How, for example, does neuronal gene chromatin in non-neural cells,
where neuronal genes are never expressed, compare to
that in neurons where these genes are expressed? In
multipotent neural stem or progenitor cells, neuronal
genes are repressed, but the cells have the capacity for
subsequent expression in response to a developmental
signal. Does neuronal gene chromatin in the progenitors
reflect a state that is intermediate between suppression
and activation, or is there a switch between a silenced and
active state upon differentiation? Finally, what is the
status of neuronal gene chromatin in pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells that have the unique capacity to
differentiate into all cell lineages of the developing
embryo?
For the establishment of epigenetic modifications representing distinct stages of differentiation, chromatin modifiers, such as DNA methyltransferases, histone
methyltransferases and histone acetyltransferases, are
recruited to specific genomic loci by DNA binding proteins, either repressors or activators [5]. A compelling
candidate for orchestrating epigenetic events is the
DNA binding protein, REST (RE1 silencing transcription factor; also called NRSF). REST was discovered in
1995 as a repressor of neuronal genes containing a 23 bp
conserved motif, known as RE1 (repressor element 1 or
NRSE) [6,7]. Several lines of evidence now point to
REST as a key protein for regulating the large network
of genes essential for neuronal function [8]. Here, we
discuss the most recent studies on epigenetic mechanisms, orchestrated by REST, that characterize specific
stages of mammalian neurogenesis.

Introduction
Epigenetic regulation is a compelling mechanism for
controlling developmental events [1,2]. In this form of
regulation, distinct patterns of gene expression are inherited by chromatin modifications, such as DNA and histone methylation, that do not involve changes in DNA
sequence. Neurogenesis, a process central to vertebrate
development, requires the acquisition of neural cell fates
within the developing nervous system and, in parallel,
maintenance of non-neural cell fates outside the nervous
system [3]. These two complementary events must be
coordinated precisely for correct formation of the nervous
system. Furthermore, neurogenesis requires that, within
the developing nervous system, only post-mitotic neurons
will express neuronal genes, because neural stem cells or
progenitors have not yet committed to a neural lineage

Wiring a genetic network for permanent
silencing of neuronal genes outside the
nervous system
REST is obligatory for the correct development of vertebrates, because perturbation of REST expression or function in the developing embryo results in ectopic
expression of neuronal genes in non-neuronal tissues
and early embryonic lethality [9]. In terminally differentiated non-neuronal tissue, neuronal genes are presumably in a long-term silencing state. How does REST
direct this mode of silencing? The answer lies in part
with its signature functional domains. REST harbors
three functional domains: a DNA binding domain containing eight zinc-finger motifs that binds to the RE1
motif, and two independent repressor domains one

located at the amino- and one at the carboxy- terminus of
the protein [10]. The amino terminal repressor domain
interacts with mSin3, a corepressor found in all eukaryotes that recruits histone deacetylases (HDACs) [11–14].
The mSin3–HDAC complex, however, is associated primarily with a dynamic mode of repression that can alternate between repression and activation and, therefore, by
itself, would probably be inadequate for long-term silencing of neuronal genes. This conundrum was solved by
the discovery of the corepressor CoREST, which interacts
directly with the carboxy terminal repressor domain of
REST [15,16] and, similar to mSin3, exists stably in
complexes with HDACs [16–18]. Interestingly, unlike
mSin3, CoREST is present only in organisms with a
nervous system [19], pointing to CoREST as a more
specialized corepressor. Several recent studies indicate
that the REST–CoREST complex recruits chromatin
modifiers for long-term silencing of neuronal genes
[20–22] (Figure 1a). Specifically, CoREST can form
immuno-complexes not only with HDACs but also with
the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3–K9) methyltransferase G9a
[23] and with the newly discovered histone H3 lysine 4
(H3–K4) demethylase LSD1 [24] (that is also known as
KIAA0601 or BHC110) [25], both of which mediate
modifications associated with gene silencing. Importantly, these histone-modifying enzymes are required
for REST–CoREST silencing in non-neuronal cells
[22,24]. Furthermore, CoREST recruits to the
REST–RE1 site other silencing machinery, including
the methyl DNA-binding protein MeCP2 and the histone

H3–K9 methyltransferase SUV39H1 [21]. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which causes compaction of
chromatin and is associated with histone H3–K9 methyltransferases, is also present on the neuronal gene chromatin [21], specifically on the RE1 region [22]. The
effects of these modifications are manifested in histone
deacetylation, an absence of H3–K4 methylation, and
presence of H3–K9 methylation, which creates binding
sites for HP1 and condensation of the targeted chromatin
(Figure 1a). Additionally, the recruitment of silencing
machinery by REST–CoREST might result in the propagation of silencing across a large chromosomal interval
containing several neuronal genes that do not have their
own REST binding sites [21], suggesting a relationship
between higher order chromatin structure and patterns of
gene expression.
The methylation of cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides in the genome represents an additional epigenetic
modification of biological importance [26]. DNA methylation can interfere with transcription by repulsing or
attracting DNA binding proteins. The REST binding
site (RE1) contains a CpG dinucleotide and recent studies reveal that the RE1 and surrounding region of
neuronal genes is methylated in differentiated non-neuronal cells [27]. Furthermore, the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, which interacts with histone H3–K9
methyltransferases [28], is associated with the RE1 region
of neuronal gene chromatin (J Chenoweth and G Mandel,
unpublished). Binding of REST to the RE1 site, how-

Figure 1

REST–CoREST orchestrates differential epigenetic mechanisms to inactivate neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells. (a) REST–CoREST recruits
a silencing complex to neuronal genes in terminally differentiated non-neuronal cells. Neuronal gene chromatin is a substrate for chromatin
modifying enzymes including histone deacetylases (HDAC 1,2), histone H3 lysine 4 demethylase (histone demethylase K4), and histone H3–K9
methyltransferases (HMTases K9). Methylated lysine 9 residues (mK9) are binding sites for heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which causes
chromatin condensation. The REST binding site (RE1) and adjacent region is methylated at CpGs (m) and associated with the methyl DNA
binding protein MeCP2. MeCp2 is also associated with Sin3–HDAC complexes. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is recruited to the methylated
RE1 site. The small carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase (SCP) might block RNA polymerase II activity. (b) REST–CoREST–mSin3
recruits a repressor complex to neuronal genes in embryonic stem and progenitor cells. HDAC 1 and 2 are predominant modifiers mediating
repression of neuronal genes. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is associated with neuronal gene chromatin probably because of a relatively low state
of chromatin compaction (compare a with b). The RE1 sequence and adjacent region is not methylated and histones are marked by methylation
of K4 (mK4). The presence of methylated K4 suggests that histone H3–K4 methyltransferase (HMTase K4) is probably present on the RE1 site.
The presence of SCP is not confirmed, but functional studies suggest it is probably present on the RE1. SCP could function to keep Pol II
minimally active.

ever, is independent of DNA methylation [27]. The
repressor MeCP2 (methyl-CpG-binding protein-2) binds
methylated DNA [1] and recruits additional modifiers
such as HDAC [29] and histone H3–K9 methyltransferase
activity [30]. In some cases, a reciprocal relationship was
found between DNA and histone methylation, whereby
methylation of K9 in histone H3 induced DNA methylation and vice versa [31–33]. The methylation-independent binding of REST to the RE1 motif raises the
question of whether REST could mediate a type of
repression that, unlike the case in differentiated nonneuronal cells, does not involve histone H3–K9 methylation.

Programming a poised status for neuronal
gene chromatin in pluripotent embryonic
stem cells
The silencing of neuronal gene chromatin in differentiated non-neuronal cells is stable, inheritable and
endures the lifetime of the animal. By contrast, embryonic stem cells, although also non-neuronal, still have the
capacity for self-renewal and differentiation along all cell
lineages. The question arises as to whether these two
fundamentally different non-neuronal cell types utilize
similar epigenetic mechanisms to suppress the same
neuronal genes? If so, ES cells and, presumably, neural
stem and progenitors must erase the epigenetic silencing
marks and reprogram chromatin, during differentiation, to
enable expression of neuronal genes in a lineage-dependent manner. Our recent studies indicate that erasure and
reprogramming of chromatin does not occur. Rather,
neuronal gene chromatin in ES and progenitor cells is
programmed to stay in a repressed state that is none-theless poised for expression [27] (Figure 1b). In this state
REST is bound to the RE1 motif but, surprisingly, its
corepressors, CoREST, mSin3, HDAC and MeCP2,
which are present on silenced neuronal gene chromatin,
are also present in ES cells. Analysis of the epigenetic
modifications, however, reveals that, unlike the situation
in differentiated non-neuronal cells, the RE1 motif and
surrounding sequences in neuronal genes are not methylated. In this case, MeCP2 is probably recruited to the
RE1 by a mSin3–HDAC complex [34]. Coincident with
the hypomethylated DNA is the absence of histone H3–
K9 methylation in the RE1 region and greatly reduced
levels of the associated methyltransferase G9a (when
compared with the levels in terminally differentiated
non-neuronal cells) [27]. Moreover, the repressed neuronal gene chromatin in ES cells is instead enriched in
di- and tri- methylated K4 on histone H3 [27], modifications associated normally with actively transcribed
genes [35]. In the case of ES cells, but not terminally
differentiated non-neuronal cells, RNA polymerase ll
(Pol ll) is present on RE1 sites in the 50 untranslated
regions of several neuronal genes, accompanied by very
low transcript levels [27]. Thus, the epigenetic modifications associated with the RE1 sites of neuronal genes
Current Opinion in Neurobiology 2005, 15:500–506

in stem cells point to an inactive, but permissive, chromatin
state that is poised for subsequent activation. Recent
studies have shown that a family of small Pol ll carboxyl-terminal domain phosphatases (SCPs) are probably
recruited by REST to the RE1 sites of neuronal genes in
P19 embryonal carcinoma stem cells [36]. Phosphataseinactive forms of SCP interfere with REST function and
promote neural differentiation [36]. One of the roles of
the SCPs in ES cells might be to contribute to a poised state
by maintaining lower levels of Pol ll activity on neuronal
genes. SCPs were also found in REST complexes in
differentiated non-neuronal cells [36]. Although Pol ll
is not associated with neuronal genes in these cells, SCPs
might provide additional security for the silenced state.
Taken together, these findings suggest that the core
REST complex establishes a distinct set of epigenetic
marks by recruiting different chromatin modifying proteins in differentiated non-neuronal and ES cells.
Whether the absence of DNA methylation prevents
recruitment of specialized machinery necessary for
long-term silencing typical of differentiated non-neuronal
cells remains unknown.
How does the inactive yet permissive state escape being
converted to an active state? Several diverse enzymatic
activities might help to maintain neuronal genes in a state
of suspended animation. For example, HDACs, which
function to lower levels of acetylated histones; SCPs,
which might reduce activity of Pol ll; and the histone
H3–K4 demethylase LSD1, which is present in CoREST
immuno-complexes in ES cells (N Ballas, G Mandel,
unpublished data); might all contribute to maintenance
of the poised state. Finally, microRNAs have been implicated recently as key players in the self-renewal of stem
cells [37]. These small non-coding RNAs might complement the activities of chromatin modifiers that keep
transcript levels low, either by blocking translation of
neuronal mRNAs or by selective degradation of neuronal
transcripts.

Plasticity versus stability of neuronal gene
chromatin, a glance at the outcome
The repression of neuronal gene expression in differentiated non-neuronal and ES cells is associated with two
different epigenetic states. Although both states involve
HDAC, the consequences for neuronal gene expression
are quite different. In particular, whereas there is no basal
transcription of several neuronal genes in differentiated
non-neuronal cells, these same genes are transcribed at
low levels in ES cells [27]. Furthermore, perturbation of
HDAC activity, a modifier associated with active repression, relieves repression of these genes in ES but not in
differentiated non-neuronal cells [27]. It appears that
HDAC activity might play a global role in maintaining the
plasticity of neuronal gene chromatin because its inhibition also results in neuronal differentiation of multipotent

adult neural stem cells [38]. What might be the natural
spring that releases neuronal genes from repression in
stem cells? Many genes that are up-regulated by HDAC
inhibition, including the neurogenic transcription factor
NeuroD that contains an RE1 site [8], are targets of
REST, pointing to the disappearance of REST as the
key switch for relieving the inactive state of neuronal

gene chromatin. This idea receives support from the
recent demonstration that overexpression of a chimera
containing the REST DNA binding domain fused to the
transcriptional activator domain of VP16, in neural stem
cells or in muscle progenitors, induces neuronal differentiation [39,40]. Interestingly, ES cell chromatin is
globally enriched in histone H3 and H4 acetylation in

Figure 2

There are two separate models to explain REST regulation of neuronal genes during embryonic and adult neurogenesis. In both the embryonic
and the adult neural stem cell, neuronal genes are actively repressed by a REST repressor complex and chromatin is relatively compact.
(a) During embryonic differentiation, REST is removed at two distinct stages, first at the dividing progenitor stage by proteosomal degradation
(broken pink oval), and then at terminal differentiation (mature neuron) by removal from chromatin and transcriptional repression. In the mature
neuron, REST corepressors are dissociated from RE1 but still present, chromatin is relaxed and neuronal genes are expressed. (b) During
differentiation of adult neural stem cells (right), REST remains on neuronal gene chromatin, and a small double stranded non-coding RNA
containing RE1 (green wavy line between RE1 and REST), converts REST from a repressor to an activator by dismissal of corepressors and
recruitment of coactivators.

addition to di- and tri- methylation of K4 on histone H3,
relative to differentiated non-neuronal cells [41], indicating that these modifications might contribute to global
plasticity of ES chromatin. Collectively, these findings
suggest that the epigenetic modifications that are characteristic of embryonic and neural stem cells are correlated with chromatin plasticity and the ability to
differentiate along a neuronal cell lineage.

The chromatin state at terminal
differentiation: neurons at last
The transition from stem or progenitor cell to a postmitotic neuron requires disarming REST. During cortical
differentiation, post-translational degradation of the
REST protein precedes both its dismissal from RE1 sites
and transcriptional inactivation of the REST gene itself at
terminal differentiation [27] (Figure 2). The identity of
transcriptional activators that might function after REST
departure is not known, but a novel neuronal protein,
termed inhibitor of BRAF35 (iBRAF), is an intriguing
candidate. IBRAF expression increases during neuronal
differentiation and abrogates REST mediated repression
of neuronal target genes (R Shiekhattar, personal communication). In contrast to differentiation during embryogenesis, the differentiation of adult hippocampal stem
cells to neurons occurs via a small non-coding double
stranded RNA (dsRNA) containing RE1 motif that converts REST from a repressor to an activator of neuronal

genes [42] (Figure 2). Whether this dsRNA plays a role
in differentiation of neural stem and progenitor cells
during development has yet to be determined. If so, it
must act through a different mechanism that does not
depend upon the persistent presence of REST.
At terminal differentiation, the transition to an active
chromatin state is accompanied by hyper-methylation
of K4 on histone H3, in particular tri-methylation, around
the RE1 sites in the proximity of the transcriptional start
sites of neuronal genes [27]. The transcriptional activity
of some neuronal genes is adjusted even further by the
continued presence of REST corepressors, including
HDAC. Perturbation of HDAC activity in neurons results
in elevated expression of these genes, suggesting additional plasticity of neuronal gene chromatin in mature
neurons [27]. Indeed, the gene encoding brain derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as a representative of this
class, can be up regulated either by interference with
HDAC activity [27] or by exposing neurons to 50 mM
potassium chloride [27,43,44]. The treatment with
potassium chloride correlates with phosphorylation of
MeCP2 and its departure [43], along with mSin3A and
HDAC [44], from the sites of methylated DNA. It will be
important to determine whether MeCP2 is regulated
similarly in response to physiological stimuli in vivo.
Although MeCP2 is a global corepressor, in patients with
Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by mutations in MeCP2,

Figure 3

Different possible outcomes of re-expression of REST in mature neurons. (a) Chromatin status of mature neurons, in the absence of REST.
Active neuronal chromatin is in a relaxed conformation and marked by an increased amount of trimethylated lysine 4 on histone 3 (tri-mK4)
compared with the amount of dimethylated lysine 4 on histone 3 (di-mK4). REST reassembles a core corepressor complex. (b) Re-expression
of REST might result in reprogramming of neuronal genes to a repressed state by reduction of trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (tri-mK4),
and compaction, probably by histone deacetylation, of chromatin. (c) Alternatively, REST recruits corepressors, but is unable to reprogram the
chromatin to a repressed state (number of trimethyl lysine 4 residues is unchanged from original neuronal chromatin and chromatin stays relaxed)
and, therefore, neuronal genes are still transcribed.

the nervous system is selectively affected [45,46].
Furthermore, in mouse models mutations in MeCP2
result in hyper-acetylation of histone H3 in certain areas
of the brain [47]. Thus, in neurons, MeCP2 probably
plays a predominant role in epigenetic control of chromatin status in the absence of REST.

Conclusions and future directions
Epigenetic regulation of neuronal gene chromatin by
REST is fundamental for maintaining stem cells in an
undifferentiated pluripotent state and for proper acquisition of neural fate during neurogenesis. The disappearance of REST during cortical neurogenesis appears to be a
prerequisite for normal neuronal function in the adult. Are
there any situations under which REST is re-expressed in
mature neurons and, if so, what are the consequences?
Previous in situ hybridization studies of adult rat hippocampal neurons indicated that low steady-state levels of
REST transcripts were increased after induction of seizure [48]. No evidence was provided, however, for induction of REST protein. To our knowledge, there is only
one example in which both mRNA and REST protein
were up-regulated in adult neurons, and that was after a
global ischemic insult [49]. Here, REST induction in
hippocampal neurons repressed expression of the
REST-regulated GluR2 gene, a subunit of AMPA receptors, and antisense knock-down of REST prevented the
suppression [49].
The above findings raise several questions. Are all REST
target genes repressed or is the effect gene-specific? Is
repression dependent upon neuronal type or physiological
stimulus? Does long-term expression of REST promote
de-differentiation of mature neurons or are there intrinsic
barriers for reversing phenotype? Related to this, is any dedifferentiation accompanied by epigenetic reprogramming from an active to an inactive chromatin state
(Figure 3)? To date, there is little information on the
molecular underpinnings of epigenetic reprogramming.
Recent Xenopus nuclear transplantation studies have, however, indicated the existence of an epigenetic memory that
impedes efficient reprogramming of previously transcribed genes during development [50]. The ability to
reconstitute REST and its corepessor components back
onto neuronal gene chromatin in mature neurons (J Chenoweth and G Mandel, unpublished) might provide a new
paradigm for investigating the fascinating problem of how
to reprogram neuronal gene chromatin of mature neurons
either in situ or after nuclear transplantation.

resultant neurons integrate, without forming tumors, into mouse brain. This
is the first example of the conversion of myoblasts to neuronal cells.

This study highlights a role for REST in orchestrating differential epigenetic modifications in terminally differentiated fibroblasts and in pluripotent embryonic stem cells or neural progenitors. It provides support for
the idea that stem cells and progenitors are poised for subsequent
neuronal differentiation in terms of their chromatin status.
