ell differentiation and withdrawal from the cell cycle are
tightly coordinated processes during development. Thus,
mechanisms essential for regulation of the cell cycle also influence processes of cell differentiation (1). An important mechanism for cell cycle control involves inhibition of cyclindependent kinases (CDKs) by CDK inhibitors (Ckis) (2).
Members of the Cip兾Kip family of Ckis, consisting of p21Cip1,
p27Kip1, and p57Kip2, control cell cycle exit and cell differentiation in vivo (1, 3). However, only p57Kip2 has been shown to play
essential roles during embryogenesis for which other Ckis cannot
compensate (4–6). With the exception of abnormal maturation
of retina amacrine interneurons, central nervous system-related
deficiencies have not been reported in p57-null mutant mice (6).
Dopamine (DA)-producing cells are generated in the ventral
floor of the embryonic midbrain (7, 8). These cells are degenerating in Parkinson’s disease and are therefore of major clinical
interest (9–11). Early signaling by the secreted factors sonic
hedgehog and fibroblast growth factor 8 contributes to patterning events and the establishment of a proliferating dopaminergic
progenitor cell population expressing aldehyde dehydrogenase 1
(Aldh1a1) (12–14). As dividing progenitor cells stop proliferating, they begin to express the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1
(NR4A2) (13). Nurr1 lacks a cavity for ligand binding as
revealed from the recently solved x-ray crystal structure of the
Nurr1 ligand-binding domain and is therefore defined as a
ligand-independent member of the nuclear receptor family (15).
Nurr1 has been shown to be essential for midbrain DA neuron
development because Nurr1 knockout animals lack tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH) and other dopaminergic characteristics (16–
18). Nurr1 is required for sustained expression of DA cellspecific genes, normal cell migration, target area innervation,
and cell survival (13, 18, 19). Nurr1 overexpression in stem cells
has allowed engineering of DA neurons in culture. These results
may prove important in efforts to establish cell replacement
therapies in Parkinson’s disease (10, 11, 20). Nurr1 may also be
more directly associated with neurodegenerative disease because
www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.2635658100

mutations in the human Nurr1 gene have been identified in
familial Parkinson’s disease (21). However, despite intense
interest in understanding the development of DA cells, Nurr1regulated genes important in DA neuron development have not
been previously identified.
In our efforts to understand mechanisms of dopaminergic cell
differentiation promoted by Nurr1 we have used the DAsynthesizing neuronal MN9D cell line. Overexpression of Nurr1
in MN9D cells, which show properties of immature dopaminergic cells, results in cell cycle arrest and morphological maturation
characterized by flattened cell morphology and extension of long
neurites (22). Moreover, Nurr1 expression in these cells leads to
a marked up-regulation of dopaminergic markers, increased
synthesis and secretion of DA (23). In the present study, MN9D
cells were used to identify Nurr1-regulated genes involved in
maturation events in developing DA cells. Our studies reveal that
Nurr1 up-regulates p57Kip2, which in these cells cooperates with
Nurr1 in promoting differentiation of DA cells, possibly by a
direct protein–protein interaction. Expression of p57Kip2 in
developing DA cells, the requirement of Nurr1 for p57Kip2
expression in these cells, and the phenotype of p57Kip2 genetargeted mice indicate that this Cki plays a corresponding critical
role in maturation of developing DA cells in vivo.

DEVELOPMENTAL
BIOLOGY

Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors of the Cip兾Kip family play
critical roles in regulating cell proliferation during embryogenesis.
However, these proteins also influence cell differentiation by
mechanisms that have remained unknown. Here we show that
p57Kip2 is expressed in postmitotic differentiating midbrain dopamine cells. Induction of p57Kip2 expression depends on Nurr1, an
orphan nuclear receptor that is essential for dopamine neuron
development. Moreover, analyses of p57Kip2 gene-targeted mice
revealed that p57Kip2 is required for the maturation of midbrain
dopamine neuronal cells. Additional experiments in a dopaminergic cell line demonstrated that p57Kip2 can promote maturation by
a mechanism that does not require p57Kip2-mediated inhibition of
cyclin-dependent kinases. Instead, evidence indicates that p57Kip2
functions by a direct protein–protein interaction with Nurr1. Thus,
in addition to its established function in control of proliferation,
these results reveal a mechanism whereby p57Kip2 influences
postmitotic differentiation of dopamine neurons.

Gal4DBD-Nurr1 (1–262) encodes the first 262 amino acid
residues of Nurr1 in frame with the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding
domain. The luciferase reporters were used as described (24).
Cell Culture, Transfection, and Differentiation Assay. MN9D and
human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured and
transfected as described (22). The cell line derived from MN9D
cells in which Nurr1 expression is under control of tetracycline
(MN9D-Nurr1 Tet-On ) was generated by cotransfection of
pTRE2-Nurr1 and pTK-Hygro into MN9D cells expressing the
reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator. Cells expressing
Nurr1 after culturing in the presence of the tetracycline derivative doxocycline (dox, 2 ␮g兾ml; BD Clontech) were selected and
further characterized (23). Differentiation assays were performed as described (22).
Preparation of Nuclear Extracts, Immunoprecipitation, and Western
Blot Analysis. Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were

made as reported (25). For immunoprecipitation, protein Sepharose-precleared nuclear extracts were incubated with the indicated antibody in nuclear extract buffer overnight at 4°C.
Immunocomplexes bound to protein A- or G-Sepharose were
collected by centrifugation and washed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. For immunoblot analysis, nuclear-cell extracts or immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS兾PAGE and
blotted; protein pieces were detected with anti-Flag (Sigma), or
anti-hemagglutinin (HA) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) antibodies as described (26).

p57Kip2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Nurr1 (19) antibodies
were used in immunodetection. Alexa Fluor 488 or 594 conjugated
anti-IgG were used as secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes).
Paraformaldehyde-fixed cells and sections were blocked in PBS兾
0.5% FBS兾0.3% triton and successively incubated with primary
(4°C, 16 h) and secondary antibodies (room temperature, 1 h).

Mammalian Two-Hybrid Assay. HEK-293 cells were cotransfected
with VP16-p57Kip2 and Gal4DBD-Nurr1 (1–262) along with a
reporter gene driven by four copies of Gal4-binding sites. The cells
were subsequently harvested and analyzed as described (24).

Results
Expression of Ckis in DA Neurons. In attempts to understand

mechanisms of dopaminergic differentiation we used the DAsynthesizing neuronal MN9D cell line that shows properties of
immature dopaminergic cells. Overexpression of Nurr1 in
MN9D cells results in cell cycle arrest and morphological
maturation characterized by flattened cell morphology, extension of long neurites, and increased DA synthesis (22, 23). In a
clone derived from MN9D cells in which Nurr1 expression is
under control of tetracycline (MN9D-Nurr1Tet-On), cells accumulated in G1 phase of the cell cycle within 24 h of dox
treatment, and a mature morphological phenotype of these cells
was evident after 48 h (23). In addition, dox treatment increases
DA content and the expression of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase and vesicular monoamine transporter 2, indicating
an instructive role for Nurr1 in controlling DA synthesis and
storage in these cells (23).
Expression of mRNAs encoding members of the Cip兾Kip
family in dox-treated MN9D-Nurr1Tet-On cells was analyzed by
RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). p57Kip2 mRNA was markedly up-regulated

p57Kip2 and Nurr1 Cooperate in the Maturation of MN9D Cells by a
Physical Interaction. MN9D cells were used to analyze how p57Kip2

might contribute to the differentiation of DA cells. As shown,
Nurr1 induces morphological differentiation of MN9D cells (22).
In contrast, overexpression of p57Kip2 alone was not efficient in
promoting MN9D cell differentiation, whereas coexpression of
both p57Kip2 and Nurr1 drastically increased the number of
differentiated cells (Fig. 3A). The rate of cell death or proliferation was not influenced by p57Kip2, indicating that p57Kip2
cooperated with Nurr1 in the process of cell maturation.
We speculated that functional cooperativity in MN9D cell
maturation might reflect direct protein–protein interaction between p57Kip2 and Nurr1. Indeed, the following observations
demonstrated that these two proteins physically interact. (i)
Interaction was detected by coimmunoprecipitation from nuclear extracts of HEK 293 cells expressing either Flagimmunotagged Nurr1, HA-immunotagged p57Kip2, or both (Fig.
3B). In contrast, Nurr1 did not interact with p21Cip1 or p27Kip1
(data not shown). (ii) Significantly, protein–protein interaction
was detected by coimmunoprecipitation in extracts from E15 rat
embryo ventral midbrain (Fig. 3C). Rat rather than mouse tissue
was used in this experiment because bigger pieces of ventral
midbrain can be dissected from rat embryos. (iii) Physical
interaction was also detected in transfected cells by a mammalian

p57Kip2 (A and B), Nurr1 (C and D), TH (E and F), and En1 (G and H) mRNAs. In
the Nurr1 mutant midbrain, expression of p57Kip2 is exclusively downregulated in the mantle zone (mz) but not in the Nurr1-negative ventricular
zone (vz) (B). In the wild type, Nurr1, TH, and En1 are expressed in the mantle
zone (C, E, and G). Nurr1 and TH were not detected in the Nurr1 mutant ventral
midbrain (D and F), whereas expression of En1 remains expressed in Nurr1deficient cells (H). (Scale bar, 100 ␮m.)

two-hybrid assay. In these experiments the interaction between
two fusion proteins were analyzed after cotransfection in HEK
293 cells. One fusion protein contains the first 262 amino acids
of Nurr1 fused to the yeast transcription factor Gal4 (Gal4Nurr1). A second fusion protein contains a p57Kip2 derivative
fused to the transactivation domain of herpes simplex virus VP16
(VP16-p57) (Fig. 3D). (iv) p57Kip2 and Nurr1 can interact in vitro
on a specific Nurr1 DNA-binding site (NBRE) (Fig. 3E).
p57Kip2兾Nurr1 binding on the NBRE suggested that p57Kip2
might modulate Nurr1 transcriptional activity. Indeed, p57Kip2
exerted a negative influence on reporter gene activation in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 F and G). In conclusion, our
results demonstrate that Nurr1 and p57Kip2 cooperate in inducing maturation of MN9D cells by a mechanism that may depend
on direct interaction between these two proteins.
To begin elucidating the significance of the observed protein–
protein interaction, we first analyzed structural requirements of
Nurr1 for interaction with p57Kip2. Nurr1 derivatives lacking
either the entire carboxy-terminal ligand-binding domain兾
activation function 2 transactivation function (Nurr11–355), the
first amino-terminal 93 (Nurr194 –598) or 182 (Nurr1183–598) amino
acid residues of the AF1 transactivation domain were used in
coimmunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 4A). Whereas deletion of
the carboxy-terminal ligand-binding domain兾activation function
2 domain did not influence interaction with p57Kip2, both the
short and long deletion in the amino-terminal domain abolished
interactions (Fig. 4A). These data are also consistent with the
two-hybrid experiment displayed in Fig. 3D, showing that the
amino-terminal domain of Nurr1 is sufficient for interaction with

and accumulated after 12 h of dox treatment of MN9DNurr1Tet-On cells. p21Cip1 mRNA was also already up-regulated
after 1 h of dox treatment, whereas p27Kip1 mRNA was not
induced at any time point analyzed. In control experiments, a
subclone of the MN9D cell line expressing the tetracyclinedependent transcription factor was dox-treated to ascertain that
the effects on cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and Cki expression depend on Nurr1 expression (data not shown). Together,
these results suggest that Nurr1 regulates p21Cip1 and p57Kip2 in
MN9D DA cells.
Next we analyzed if p57Kip2 and p21Cip1 might be regulated by
Nurr1 in vivo. The expression patterns of p57Kip2, p21Cip1, and
p27Kip1 were analyzed in relation to Nurr1 and TH in the
developing mouse brain. In situ hybridization on sagittal sections
from E13.5 showed strong Nurr1 expression in the ventral
midbrain (Fig. 1B and ref. 28). p57Kip2 was localized predominantly to the ventricular mitotically active cells lining the ventricles (Fig. 1C). p57Kip2 was also detected in the ventral midbrain
in a pattern virtually indistinguishable from that of TH and
overlapping with the Nurr1 expression domain (Fig. 1C, compare with B and D), indicating that p57Kip2 is expressed in
differentiating postmitotic DA cells. Immunohistochemistry and
confocal imaging of coronal sections from E13.5 ventral midbrain confirmed p57Kip2 and Nurr1 coexpression in the nuclei of
developing DA cells (Fig. 1 E–G). In contrast, p21Cip1 was rather
uniformly expressed in the entire central nervous system at
E13.5, whereas p27Kip1 expression was not detected in the ventral
midbrain (data not shown). Thus, the Nurr1-induced expression
of p21Cip1 in MN9D cells does not appear to correspond to a
Nurr1-regulated p21Cip1-expression pattern in vivo. To investigate if Nurr1 regulates p57Kip2 expression in developing DA
neurons, p57Kip2 mRNA expression was analyzed in wild-type
and Nurr1-null mutant mice (Fig. 2). In addition to the mantle
zone where p57Kip2 was coexpressed with Nurr1, p57Kip2 was also
localized to the adjacent Nurr1-negative ventricular zone (Fig.
2 A). In E13.5 Nurr1-null mouse embryos p57Kip2 mRNA levels
were drastically diminished in the mantle zone, but not in the
Nurr1-negative ventricular zone (Fig. 2 A–D). Reduced p57Kip2
expression was not due to a cellular deficiency because other DA
cell markers, including En1, Aldh1a1, and Ptx3, remain expressed at normal levels at this relatively early developmental
stage (Fig. 2 G and H and ref. 13). Thus, Nurr1 is required for
p57Kip2 expression in maturing postmitotic DA cells.

with Nurr1. (A) MN9D cells were cotransfected with enhanced GFP (EGFP) expression vector together with expression vectors for Nurrl, p57Kip2, or both. The

subjected to immunoblotting with anti-HA or anti-Flag antibodies (Top). Nuclear
cell extracts were immunoprecipitated by using anti-Nurr1 (Middle) or antip57Kip2 (Bottom) antibodies, and immune complexes were subjected to immunoblotting by using anti-HA or anti-Flag antibodies. (C) p57Kip2 interacts with
Nurr1 in extracts from the embryonal ventral midbrain. Total cell extracts were
prepared from rat E15 ventral midbrain and immunoprecipitated by using antiIgG control (left lane) or anti-Nurr1 antibodies (center lane). Immune complexes
were subjected to immunoblotting by using anti- p57Kip2 antibodies. Nuclear cell
extract from HEK 293 cells transfected with expression vectors encoding p57Kip2
was used as control (right lane). (D) p57Kip2 and Nurr1 proteins interact in
transfected cells. The interaction between p57Kip2 and Nurr1 was confirmed by
using a mammalian two-hybrid assay. HEK 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors VP16-p57Kip2 and Gal4DBD-Nurr1 (1–262). These vectors were
transfected either alone or as indicated in the figure together with a luciferase
reporter gene driven by four UAS Gal4-binding sites. Relative light units (RLU)
were computed after normalization to ␤-galactosidase activities. Gal4DBD-Nurr1
(1–262) activates the reporter gene due to the presence of a transactivation
domain within the Nurr1 amino-terminal domain. Activation is strongly enhanced by cotransfection of VP16-p57Kip2. (E) A gel-mobility shift assay demonstrated that in vitro transcribed and translated HA-p57Kip2 formed complexes
with in vitro translated Nurr1 bound to a 32P-labeled NBRE DNA probe. The
positions of Nurr1 (shift) and Nurr1兾p57Kip2 complexes (super shift) bound to
NBREs are indicated. Coincubation with HA antibodies abolished the binding of
p57Kip2 to the Nurr1 bound to NBRE probe. (F) p57Kip2 inhibits Nurr1 activation of
a reporter gene containing Nurr1 DNA-binding sites (NBREs). MN9D cells were

p57Kip2. We then tested the ability of these derivatives to
cooperate with p57Kip2 in MN9D cell maturation. The noninteracting derivatives (Nurr194 –598 and Nurr1183–598) failed to
cooperate with p57Kip2 in inducing maturation of MN9D cells
(Fig. 4B). In contrast, the interaction-competent Nurr11–355
derivative retained the ability to cooperate with p57Kip2. In fact,
this derivative was even more potent than wild-type Nurr1,
perhaps because of an increased ability to interact with p57Kip2
(Fig. 4A). Thus, efficient maturation required expression of both
p57Kip2 and Nurr1 derivatives capable of interacting with p57Kip2.
The observed effects on maturation induced by p57Kip2 and
Nurr1 suggested that p57Kip2, induced as a result of Nurr1
overexpression, may significantly contribute to the maturation of
MN9D cells. Expression of antisense p57Kip2 RNA (asp57) was
used to assess the importance of p57Kip2 for MN9D cell maturation (Fig. 4C). Although asp57 expression did not disrupt cell
cycle arrest induced by Nurr1 (data not shown), presumably due
to Nurr1-induced expression of p21Cip1 (Fig. 1A), asp57 abolished Nurr1-induced cell maturation (Fig. 4C). Thus, these data
demonstrate that maturation and cell cycle arrest are independently controlled in these cells.
p57Kip2 Promotes MN9D Cell Maturation by Means of a CDK-Independent Mechanism. To further investigate specific requirements for

cell maturation, we used a mutated derivative of p57Kip2
(p57CKmut) (29) that is unable to inhibit CDK activity. The
mutation did not interfere with the ability of p57Kip2 to interact

coronal sections to detect apoptotic cells in the E18.5 wild-type and p57Kip2null mutant ventral midbrain. TUNEL-positive cells in the area of midbrain DA
cells were observed and counted in wild-type and p57Kip2 mutant mice. An
increase in apoptotic cells in the entire dopaminergic area was observed in
the mutant (J) as compared with the wild type (I) as exemplified by these
high-magnification images of the medial ventral midbrain. The increase in
the mutant was ⬎2-fold greater than the wild type (K) (E18.5, p57Kip2⫹兾⫹ ,

with Nurr1 (data not shown). Although p57CKmut is unable to
induce cell cycle arrest (29), it retains the ability to cooperate
with Nurr1 in MN9D cell maturation (Fig. 4D). Taken together,
these data provide compelling evidence, indicating that p57Kip2
promotes DA cell maturation by a mechanism that is independent of its ability to inhibit CDK activity.
p57Kip2 Is Essential for Normal DA Neuron Development in Vivo. The

importance of p57Kip2 in MN9D cells and its expression during
critical stages of DA cell differentiation in vivo suggested that
p57Kip2 might play a role for DA cell development. To verify the
role of p57Kip2 in vivo we analyzed p57Kip2-null mice (Fig. 5). DA
cells appeared abnormal in the ventral midbrain of E18.5
embryos in the absence of p57Kip2. TH immunoreactivity was
drastically reduced in this area (Fig. 5 A and B), but was
unaffected in other regions where catecholaminergic neurons
are located (Fig. 5 E–H). Thus, the phenotype is selective to
midbrain DA neurons. In situ hybridization revealed also that
Nurr1 expression was diminished in the ventral midbrain of
mutant E18.5 embryos, whereas it remained normal in other
regions, e.g., the cortex (Fig. 5 C and D and data not shown).
Furthermore, expression of both TH and Nurr1 was particularly
weak in lateral regions of the ventral midbrain, suggesting that
TH- and Nurr1-expressing cells remained in a medial location in
mutant brains (Fig. 5 A–D). Cell proliferation, as determined
after BrdUrd administration, was unaltered at several developmental stages in the ventral midbrain of p57Kip2 knockout
embryos (data not shown). Finally, occurrence of cell death was
analyzed in ventral midbrain of p57Kip2 mutant E18.5 mice. By

Discussion
Our results suggest a reciprocal relationship between Nurr1 and
p57Kip2 whereby Nurr1 activates expression of p57Kip2, which in
turn cooperates with Nurr1 in DA cell development. Strikingly,
p57Kip2 is essential for Nurr1-induced maturation of MN9D DA
cells by a mechanism that is independent of its ability to inhibit
CDKs. Instead, our data indicate that p57Kip2 may function as a
Nurr1-interacting cofactor. The resemblance in DA cell phenotypes between Nurr1 and p57Kip2 knockout mice is consistent
with a mechanism whereby both genes are involved in common
regulatory processes. Thus, the data indicate a new role for
p57Kip2 as a transcriptional cofactor with functions in neuronal
differentiation.
The conclusion that p57Kip2 promotes differentiation of DA
neurons in vivo after they have already exited the cell cycle is
supported by several observations. First, in the midbrain p57Kip2
is not only expressed in the ventricular zone where cell cycle exit
would be regulated, but also in the mantle zone of postmitotic
differentiating DA cells. Second, abnormal proliferation was not
observed in p57Kip2 knockout embryo ventral midbrain after
BrdUrd labeling at several developmental stages (data not
shown). Third, the observed p57Kip2 mutant defects appear at a
stage when developing DA neurons have already stopped proliferating. Fourth, the DA cell phenotype resembles deficiencies
observed in Nurr1 mutant embryos, with deregulation of marker
gene expression and increased cell death, indicating a function
downstream of Nurr1, which itself is not expressed until after
cells have exited the cell cycle (13). We do not exclude the
possibility that p57Kip2, together with other Ckis, such as, e.g.,
p21Cip1, may influence DA cell progenitor proliferation by a
redundant mechanism because both of these Ckis are also
expressed in ventricular proliferating progenitor cells.
How might p57Kip2 modulate the function of Nurr1 in developing DA neurons? A reporter gene assay indicated that p57Kip2
may have a negative influence on Nurr1’s transcriptional activity.
p57Kip2, which interacts with the amino-terminal domain of
Nurr1, might interfere with coactivator recruitment. However, in
a different promoter context it remains possible that interaction
between Nurr1 and p57Kip2 might exert a positive influence.
Evidently, a detailed understanding of how p57Kip2 modulates
Nurr1-dependent transcription has to await the identification of
relevant target genes. Nonetheless, the interaction between
Nurr1 and p57Kip2 clearly has a potential for modulating Nurr1,
as demonstrated by the inhibition of Nurr1-induced reporter
gene activity.
Developmental mechanisms in other cell types may likely be
analogous to those reported here. Specifically, this would imply
that some of the requirements for Ckis are independent of their
function as CDK inhibitors. Indeed, previously reported results
provide support for this view. For example, p57Kip2 has been
shown to promote muscle differentiation in a process that may
be influenced by direct interaction with the muscle-specific
transcription factor MyoD (30, 31). Moreover, other functions of

using a TUNEL assay, more than a 2-fold increase in the extent
of apoptotic cell death was revealed specifically in the p57Kip2
mutant ventral midbrain (Fig. 5 I–K). Other areas assayed for
apoptotic cells, such as the dorsal midbrain, the cortex, and the
olfactory bulb, did not show any differences between the genotypes (data not shown). At earlier stages of development (E13.5)
DA cells appeared normal in p57Kip2 mutant embryos consistent
with the onset of p57Kip2 expression at late midgestation. Taken
together, these results reveal a strict requirement for p57Kip2 in
the late maturation of midbrain DA cells. As migration and
survival of ventral midbrain cells are affected, we speculate that
the expression of Nurr1 and TH may primarily be reduced as a
consequence of fewer cells being localized in the appropriate
positions in p57Kip2 gene-targeted embryos.

types. Most notably, these cells are degenerating in Parkinson’s
disease for reasons that remain to be fully established. Characterization of DA neuron development may help to reveal processes of relevance for sustained dopaminergic functions and
neuronal survival. Perhaps more importantly, understanding
developmental mechanisms should be of significance in the use
of stem cells specifically designed for therapeutic transplantation
in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Although the studies presented here have clearly uncovered an essential component in a
major regulatory pathway of dopaminergic differentiation in
vivo, future work will determine to what extent this knowledge
may contribute to attempts to engineer DA neurons from stem
cells in vitro.

Cip兾Kip Ckis have been reported to be uncoupled from the
control of cellular proliferation (6, 32). More versatile functions
involving Ckis may thus provide a rational mechanism whereby
withdrawal from the cell cycle can be efficiently integrated with
subsequent cellular differentiation events. p57Kip2, being the
most structurally complex member of the Cip兾Kip family of Ckis
(33, 34), may be particularly important in this regard. According
to this view, p57Kip2 may serve as a platform for multiple
protein–protein interactions, thereby promoting distinct developmental processes that help to integrate cell cycle control with
activities of cell type-specific transcription factors. Of note, other
nuclear receptor activities have been shown to be modulated by
cell cycle mediators independently of their role in cell cycle
regulation. For example, cyclin D1 can interact with estrogen
receptor and thereby enhance its transcriptional activity (35, 36).
The retinoblastoma protein can interact with the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor ␥ and thereby recruit histone
deacetylase HDAC3 to the complex (37).
Because of the involvement in disease, DA neurons represent
one of the most intensely studied central nervous system cell
