Schizophrenia is characterized by affective, cognitive, neuromorphological, and molecular abnormalities that may have a neurodevelopmental origin. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA
sequences critical to neurodevelopment and adult neuronal processes by coordinating the activity of multiple genes within biological
networks. We examined the expression of 854 miRNAs in prefrontal
cortical tissue from 100 control, schizophrenic, and bipolar subjects.
The cyclic AMP-responsive element binding- and NMDA-regulated
microRNA miR-132 was signiﬁcantly down-regulated in both the
schizophrenic discovery cohort and a second, independent set of
schizophrenic subjects. Analysis of miR-132 target gene expression in
schizophrenia gene-expression microarrays identiﬁed 26 genes upregulated in schizophrenia subjects. Consistent with NMDA-mediated
hypofunction observed in schizophrenic subjects, administration of
an NMDA antagonist to adult mice results in miR-132 down-regulation in the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, miR-132 expression in
the murine prefrontal cortex exhibits signiﬁcant developmental regulation and overlaps with critical neurodevelopmental processes
during adolescence. Adult prefrontal expression of miR-132 can be
down-regulated by pharmacologic inhibition of NMDA receptor signaling during a brief postnatal period. Several key genes, including
DNMT3A, GATA2, and DPYSL3, are regulated by miR-132 and
exhibited altered expression either during normal neurodevelopment or in tissue from adult schizophrenic subjects. Our data suggest
miR-132 dysregulation and subsequent abnormal expression of miR132 target genes contribute to the neurodevelopmental and neuromorphological pathologies present in schizophrenia.

S

chizophrenia is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by affective and cognitive symptoms. Neuromorphological
defects include decreased prefrontal and hippocampal volume,
neocortical pyramidal neuron size, and dendritic spine density. Risk
for schizophrenia is associated with neurodevelopmental disturbances during the prenatal and early postnatal period, and by
additional pathogenesis associated with brain maturation during
adolescence and early adulthood (1–3). Many candidate schizophrenia risk genes regulate neurodevelopmental functions (4, 5). In
normal brain development, ∼50% of synapses produced are lost
during adolescence by a process that is activity-dependent and
requires coordinated activity of NMDA and AMPA receptors (6).
Thus, dysregulation of synaptic pruning through NMDA/AMPA
receptor-mediated mechanisms has the potential to disrupt cognitive development. Hypoactive NMDA signaling has been implicated in schizophrenia (7, 8). Notably, NMDA receptor (NMDAR)
antagonists induce psychosis and cognitive impairment in normal
human subjects (9), and produce both positive and negative
schizophrenia-like behaviors in animal models (10, 11).

Widespread alterations in neurodevelopment and neurotransmitter signaling may arise from multiple causes. MicroRNAs
(miRNAs) have the ability to coregulate multiple biological
pathways and have recently been implicated in schizophrenia (12,
13). MiRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate the stability and translation of up to 60% of protein-coding mRNAs
(14). Dysregulation of a single miRNA can be sufﬁcient to alter
the gene-expression proﬁle and developmental trajectory of cells
(15, 16). MiRNAs contribute to regulation of many mechanisms
in the nervous system, including regulation of neuronal migration
and differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and adult neurogenesis
(17, 18).
We hypothesized that dysregulation of miRNAs contributes to
the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (19). To evaluate this possibility, we examined the expression of over 800 miRNAs in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DL-PFC) from a large sample of control,
schizophrenic, and bipolar subjects. We found disease-speciﬁc
dysregulation of several miRNAs, including miR-132, a cyclic
AMP-responsive element binding (CREB)-regulated miRNA associated with NMDAR signaling (20). We conﬁrmed dysregulation of miR-132 and several of its mRNA targets by quantitative
real-time PCR (qPCR) in a second set of human subjects and
controls. Comparison of miR-132 gene targets with relevant
microarray datasets identiﬁed signiﬁcant overlap with genes developmentally down-regulated in the PFC during adolescence in
mice. We conﬁrmed inverse expression changes in miR-132 and
several targets during normal postnatal development of the PFC
in mice, and further demonstrated that treatment with the
NMDAR antagonist MK-801 during the early postnatal period
results in adult down-regulation of miR-132 expression in the
PFC. Finally, we show that miR-132 regulates schizophrenia- and
development-associated genes including DNMT3A, GATA2, and
DPYSL3. These results implicate miR-132 and its mRNA targets
in the etiology and pathology of schizophrenia.

Results
MicroRNA Microarray Analysis of Control, Schizophrenia, and Bipolar
DL-PFC Samples. Microarray analysis of RNA samples derived

from BA46 of control (CON, n = 34), bipolar (BPD, n = 31),
and schizophrenic (SCZ, n = 35) subjects obtained from the
Stanley Medical Research Institute (SMRI) Array Collection
(Table S1) showed that 483 of 854 assayed miRNAs were
expressed above threshold in DL-PFC tissue. ANCOVA analysis
using diagnosis (CON, SCZ, BPD) and sex as main effects, and
brain pH and age as covariates, followed by false-discovery rate
(FDR) correction, identiﬁed only the major and minor products
of one precursor hairpin, miR-132 and miR-132*, to be signiﬁcantly altered in schizophrenia (Table 1 and Dataset S1). Samples from subjects with bipolar disorder exhibited signiﬁcant
dysregulation of 10 miRNAs.
There was no overlap between the signiﬁcantly dysregulated
miRNAs identiﬁed in schizophrenia and bipolar samples. However,
evaluation of all probes with an uncorrected P value < 0.05 identiﬁed 10 miRNAs dysregulated in both disorders, more than twice
what would be expected by chance (Dataset S2A). All 10 probes
were altered in the same direction across disorders, suggesting
some shared molecular pathology. These data support recent genome-wide association study studies suggesting schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder share overlapping risk alleles (21); however, these
studies have not identiﬁed the biological nature of the shared risk
loci. To address this discrepancy, we identiﬁed miRNAs with the
strongest association between disorders by ranking diagnosis-associated miRNA expression by fold-change and uncorrected P value.
This analysis identiﬁed six dysregulated miRNAs (miR-132, miR320, miR-135, miR-105, miR-449, and miR-17-5p) common to
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder: 754 protein-coding genes are
targeted by two or more of these miRNAs, more than would be
expected by chance (P < 0.0001), suggesting that these codysregulated miRNAs target functionally overlapping molecular networks
(SI Materials and Methods and Dataset S2B).
Association of miRNA Microarray Data with Patient Demographics. In
addition to the ANCOVA test described above, a linear regression model determined whether signiﬁcant alterations in
miRNA expression were associated with demographic details
other than diagnosis (Dataset S3). Both miR-132 and miR-132*
were correlated with age. However, all three diagnostic groups
were age-matched, precluding age as a factor in diagnosis-associated changes in miR-132. Three miRNAs, including miR-132,
-132*, and -105, correlated with the level of lifetime antipsychotic units. Additional miRNAs were signiﬁcantly associated

with psychosis (miR-32*, -181d, -330-5p, -206, and -133a) or
suicide (miR-206), but none were affected by sex or brain pH,
the two main demographic details that differed signiﬁcantly between diagnoses. In contrast to previous reports (22), we found
no disease-associated differences in either the total amount of
small RNA or the percent of total small RNA represented by the
∼22-nt mature miRNA population (Fig. S1A). Differences in
patient demographics, brain region, RNA extraction techniques,
or method of determining the percentage of small RNAs may
contribute to the differences with previous ﬁndings.
Antipsychotic Drug Treatment Does Not Affect miR-132 Expression in
Vivo. To evaluate the potential for antipsychotic drug exposure to

contribute to down-regulation of miR-132 in schizophrenic
subjects, rats were treated with therapeutically relevant doses of
haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg), risperidone (5 mg/kg), or vehicle (1%
acetic acid) for 21 d using osmotic minipumps to ensure constant
central D2-receptor occupancy at exposures comparable to that
measured in humans (23). RNA from the frontal cortex of
treated animals showed no change in expression of miR-132
compared with vehicle-treated rats, suggesting that miR-132
down-regulation is a core feature of schizophrenia, rather than
a by-product of drug treatment (Fig. S1C). These ﬁndings are
also in agreement with previously published studies (12).
qPCR Validation of Microarray Results. RNA from the SMRI samples and a second separate set of samples from control and
schizophrenic subjects, obtained from the Harvard Brain Tissue
Resource Center (HBB) (Table S2), was used to validate the
miRNA microarray results by qPCR. qPCR analysis showed a
signiﬁcant decrease in miR-132 expression in both the SCZ and
BPD samples from the SMRI collection, and in the schizophrenic
patient samples from the HBB collection (Fig. 1A). Five additional miRNAs with nonsigniﬁcant but suggestive trends in the
microarray were selected from the list in Dataset S2A for qPCR
analysis (using the HBB samples); however, no signiﬁcant changes
were observed among these miRNAs, supporting the use of the
strict FDR < P = 0.05 signiﬁcance cutoff for microarray analysis.
Alteration of miR-132 Protein-Coding Targets in SCZ and BPD. We
identiﬁed 263 putative targets of miR-132 using the TargetScan
prediction database. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software
identiﬁed biological pathways associated with predicted miR-132
targets. Twenty-six pathways were signiﬁcantly overrepresented,
ﬁve of which were speciﬁc to, or enriched in, the nervous system
(Dataset S4). The protein kinase A signaling pathway contained
the largest number of signiﬁcantly up-regulated miR-132 targets;
also of note were pathways associated with synaptic long-term
potentiation and long-term depression, neuronal CREB signaling, and DNA methylation. Importantly these pathways support
both the glutamatergic and dopaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia, and include several pathways, such as Reelin signaling,
that have been deﬁnitively associated with schizophrenia (24).
The list of miR-132 targets was compared with publicly
available gene-expression microarray data from the SMRI “A”
and “C” array collections of DL-PFC tissue from control and
schizophrenic subjects (www.stanleyresearch.org). Because miR132 is down-regulated in the SCZ samples, only putative miR132 targets signiﬁcantly up-regulated (FDR-corrected P value <
0.05) in the SMRI dataset were considered. Twenty-six genes
from the SCZ samples met these criteria (Dataset S5). A subset
of seven genes, representing key biological pathways identiﬁed
by IPA, were evaluated by qPCR. The known miR-132 target
p250GAP (25), and four other genes, GATA2, FKBP2,
ANKRD11, and PDE7B, were signiﬁcantly up-regulated in samples from schizophrenic subjects (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1B). These
results suggest that disease-associated miR-132 down-regulation

(26), Gmfb showed no age-related changes in expression. The
full-length isoform of Dnmt3a, which predominates in the brain
after birth, contains multiple 7-nt miR-132 binding sites in its 3′
UTR, and Dpysl3 contains a 8-nt miR-132 binding site in its
3′ UTR.

may have a signiﬁcant impact on the regulation of gene expression in the PFC of schizophrenic subjects.
Functional Role for miR-132 in Neurodevelopment. To identify
potential functional roles for miR-132 in the brain, we queried
the NextBio database of microarray studies (www.nextbio.com).
From 99 datasets derived from cortical tissue, the study most
enriched for predicted miR-132 targets was a microarray analysis
of the changes in developing mouse PFC between postnatal weeks
2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 (26). The most signiﬁcant overlap with miR-132
targets occurred between weeks 2 and 4 of development, equivalent to adolescence in humans and characterized by intensive
NMDAR-dependent synaptic pruning. Of 201 miR-132 gene
targets in the Nextbio database, 57 were signiﬁcantly altered between 2 and 4 wk in the mouse PFC. The majority of transcripts
were down-regulated, consistent with developmental up-regulation of miR-132 (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2 and Dataset S6). In addition to
regulating schizophrenia-related biological pathways in adult
brain, miR-132 may play a critical role in the neurodevelopmental
changes that occur during adolescence and early adulthood.
To test the hypothesis that miR-132 is developmentally regulated in the PFC, we evaluated expression of miR-132 in mRNA
isolated from mouse PFC between embryonic day 12 (E12)
through 2 mo of age (postnatal day 60, P60). MiR-132 expression
was absent or low through P7, began to rise at P14, and increased
almost fourfold between P14 and P28 (Fig. 3A). These results are
similar to miR-132 expression patterns in the developing hippocampus (27). Three putative miR-132 target mRNAs identiﬁed as
down-regulated in the developmental expression proﬁle (26),
Dnmt3a, Dypsl3, and Gmfb, were simultaneously examined. Two
of the three putative targets, Dnmt3a and Dpyls3, showed developmental expression patterns with a signiﬁcant negative
Miller et al.

In Vivo Regulation of miR-132 Expression by NMDA Signaling. The
proposed role of NMDAR-mediated hypofunction in schizophrenia (7) and previous evidence of NMDA regulation of miR132 (20) led us to examine effects of the NMDAR antagonist MK801 on miR-132 expression in adult and juvenile mice. Adult mice
were injected once daily for 5 d with either saline or one of three
doses of MK-801 (0.1, 0.3, or 0.6 mg/kg delivered intraperitoneally). MK-801 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in miR-132 expression compared with saline, indicating

showed overlap with predicted miR-132 targets. (A) The most signiﬁcant
overlap was with genes that showed altered expression between postnatal
weeks 2 and 4 in mouse PFC. (B) Of 201 predicted miR-132 targets, 57
showed a signiﬁcant change in expression between postnatal weeks 2 and 4,
with almost 75% of the targets down-regulated.

Fig. 1. Microarray analysis indicated that miR-132 expression was downregulated in the PFC from schizophrenia subjects. (A) qPCR validation of miR132 expression in the PFC from control (CON), schizophrenic (SCZ), and bipolar disorder (BPD) subjects from two separate populations (SMRI, HBB).
Lines show mean + SEM, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. (B) Signiﬁcant up-regulation
of the expression of several putative miR-132 targets was validated by qPCR
in the HBB samples. Group size for each sample set is presented in Tables S1
and S2; error bars = SEM.

Consistent with qPCR analysis, overexpression of miR-132 in
HEK293 cells signiﬁcantly decreased reporter levels for the ∼1kb 3′ UTR fragments of both Gata2 and Dpysl3 (Fig. 4A), although a Dnmt3a reporter was not affected. Evaluation of protein levels for native, full-length mRNA transcripts by Western
blot showed overexpression of miR-132 in HEK-293 cells signiﬁcantly decreased DNMT3A and GATA2 protein levels, and
knockdown of miR-132 function resulted in signiﬁcant increased
DNMT3A but not GATA2 compared with cells transduced with
a control vector (Fig. 4B and Fig. S1E) (28).
The effect of miR-132 on DNMT3A protein levels but not
reporter construct activity may be because of indirect regulation
of DNMT3A by miR-132 through a yet-unidentiﬁed pathway,
perhaps CREB-related, or because of technical constraints that
prevented the entire DNMT3A 3′ UTR from being cloned into
the reporter vector. The human DMNT3A 3′ UTR contains ﬁve
possible seed matches for miR-132 in 6 kbps, three of which show
evolutionary conservation. Factors outside the 3′ UTR seed region can also affect miRNA binding (29), and it is possible that
the region of the DNMT3A UTR used in the reporter construct
lacked nonseed sequences necessary for miR-132 binding.

Fig. 3. The expression of miR-132 (A) and two of its predicted protein-coding targets, Dnmt3a and Dpysl3 (B) in the PFC was measured from E12 through P60.
MiR-132 expression was signiﬁcantly up-regulated between postnatal weeks 2 and 4, but expression of Dnmt3a and Dpyls3 followed an opposite expression
pattern. MiR-132 expression at P14 was signiﬁcantly different from expression at P7, P21, P28, and P60 (P ≤ 0.01), Dnmt3a expression from P21 and later was
signiﬁcantly different from P14 and earlier (P ≤ 0.01), and Dpysl3 expression at P7 and P14 was signiﬁcantly different from all other time points, and between
those two time points (P ≤ 0.01). Error bars = SEM; *P < 0.05.

that 5-d inhibition of NMDAR signaling results in reduced expression of miR-132 in the prefrontal cortex (Fig. S2A).
To address consequences of neurodevelopmental disruption
of NMDAR signaling on miR-132 expression, mouse pups were
treated daily with a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) of MK-801 from P4 to
P17. This treatment protocol has been shown to produce permanent behavioral and neurochemical changes that remain
measureable throughout adulthood (10). Mice treated with MK801 during postnatal development exhibited signiﬁcant downregulation of miR-132 in the PFC in adulthood (Fig. S2B). Thus,
disruption of NMDAR signaling during postnatal development
was associated with reduced adulthood expression of miR-132,
as observed in schizophrenia.
To extend comparisons between mice treated with MK-801
during development and gene-expression patterns in schizophrenic
patients, we tested mRNA expression of two miR-132 targets upregulated in schizophrenia (p250GAP and Gata2) and two developmentally regulated miR-132 targets (Dnmt3a and Dpysl3)
within the developmental MK-801 mouse model (Fig. S2 C and D).
There was no effect of drug treatment on expression of any of the
four genes at P14. In adult mice, p250GAP was signiﬁcantly upregulated in the PFC of developmentally treated MK-801 mice
compared with controls, similar to the effect seen in the human
HBB samples. There was a trend for Gata2 up-regulation in the
MK-801 group, but it did not reach signiﬁcance. Interestingly, both
developmentally regulated genes showed sex-by-treatment effects:
Dpysl3 was signiﬁcantly up-regulated in MK-801–treated males
compared with saline-treated males, but did not differ between
female treatment groups, and Dnmt3a was signiﬁcantly up-regulated in MK-801–treated females compared with saline-treated
females, but did not differ between male treatment groups. This
sex difference is consistent with the observed up-regulation of
DNMT3A in adult female, but not male, schizophrenic patients
(Fig. S2C and Dataset S5). Comparison of the P14 and P60 age
groups showed signiﬁcant up-regulation of Gata2 and down-regulation of Dpysl3 from P14 to P60. In contrast to the results presented in Fig. 3, Dnmt3a showed no difference between ages,
a statistical effect driven by very high Dnmt3a expression in MK801–treated adult females (Fig. S2D). Limited group size at P14
prevented further comparison of age × treatment × sex effects.
Taken together, these results raise the possibility that the regulation of targets by miR-132 may be affected by both developmental
stage and hormonal milieu, an aspect of miRNA activity that
remains to be explored.

Alternate Animal Models of Disrupted NMDAR Signaling. Global
microRNA expression was also analyzed in two commonly used
animal models of altered NMDAR signaling, the NR1 hypomorphic mouse (30) and nonhuman primates in withdrawal from
chronic, low-dose phencyclidine (31). Surprisingly, neither model
showed signiﬁcant overlap with the results from the human
SMRI samples. The data, and the implications of these results,
are presented more thoroughly in the SI Materials and Methods
(Dataset S7).

Discussion
We examined the expression of more than 800 miRNAs in DLPFC tissue from a large cohort of control, schizophrenic, and
bipolar subjects. Only one, miR-132, met rigorous statistical
correction for diagnosis-associated expression. Of ∼200 bioinformatically predicted miR-132 targets, 26 were up-regulated

MicroRNA Dysregulation in Schizophrenia. Early studies of a limited
number (∼250) of miRNAs in cortical tissue from schizophrenia
subjects showed little overlap. Perkins et al. identiﬁed 16 miRNAs with altered expression in schizophrenia (12), and Beveridge et al. found widespread alterations in miRNA processing
and expression in samples from subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia (13, 22). No common miRNA was identiﬁed between
reports, possibly because of the relatively small sample sizes,
differences in brain regions, or differences in the method of
RNA extraction. Our results show some overlap with those of
Perkins et al., who found that miR-212, which is cotranscribed
with miR-132, is down-regulated in the PFC (BA9) in schizophrenia subjects (12). Our data also overlap with recently published schizophrenia datasets, including data from Kim et al. (32)
and Moreau et al. (33), who identiﬁed dysregulation of miR-132
and miR-212. MiR-181, which was identiﬁed as a schizophreniaassociated miRNA by Beveridge et al. (13), was signiﬁcantly
associated with the presence of psychotic symptoms in our
dataset; notably, both datasets identiﬁed up-regulation of miR181 in association with schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms.
Furthermore, miR-449, which we identiﬁed as dysregulated in
bipolar disorder, has been proposed as a blood biomarker for
schizophrenia (34). Our data, combined with the existing literature, suggest that several miRNAs are reproducibly associated
with schizophrenia and therefore represent candidate markers of
the molecular pathology of schizophrenia.
Regulation of miR-132 Targets in the Adult Schizophrenic Brain. MiR132 has several known functions relevant to schizophrenia. First,
miR-132 is enriched in the forebrain and is induced directly
by activity-dependent CREB and ERK signaling (25). MiR-132
targets several genes associated with synaptic plasticity, including
p250GAP and MECP2, and is predicted to regulate multiple
members of neuronal activity-speciﬁc biological pathways, including long-term potentiation and long-term depression pathways
and CREB signaling (20, 25, 28). We identiﬁed ∼25 genes predicted
as miR-132 targets and signiﬁcantly up-regulated in schizophrenia
samples, including GATA2, PDE7B, and P250GAP. P250GAP
regulates synaptic outgrowth (25), GATA2 is a transcription factor
that regulates postmitotic neuronal differentiation (35), and
PDE7B is a phosphodiesterase that has been genetically associated
with schizophrenia by linkage mapping (36). These results indicate
that miRNA and mRNA microarray data from human subjects can
be combined to successfully identify biologically relevant miRNA
targets and potentially therapeutic targets.
Regulation of miR-132 Expression by NMDAR Signaling and Neurodevelopmental Stage. MiR-132 enhances activity-dependent syn-

aptic plasticity through a positive feedback loop with the NMDAR:
it is both induced by, and potentiates, NMDAR signaling (20, 27).
We observed that pharmacologically inhibiting NMDA signaling
in rodents, either chronically in the adult or during a critical
postnatal developmental period, results in down-regulation of
miR-132 expression and up-regulation of several miR-132 targets
in the adult PFC. This process may set up a self-sustaining inhibitory cycle where reduced NMDAR activity in schizophrenia
results in reduced miR-132 expression, leaving less miR-132
available to potentiate NMDA signaling. Surprisingly, NR1 hypomorphic mice do not show abnormalities in miR-132 expression
(Dataset S7A), a ﬁnding that may be caused by the effects of
Miller et al.

strain background on miR-132 levels or the presence of the hypomorphic allele throughout the entirety of development. Additionally, NR1 hypomorphs lack a full complement of functional
synaptic NMDARs; mice treated with NMDAR antagonists retain
synaptic NMDARs in contact with internal cell signaling pathways
(30). Nevertheless, this disparity requires further investigation.
MiR-132 expression exhibited a fourfold increase in the PFC
between postnatal weeks 2 and 4, a period characterized by massive synaptic pruning, and is a strong candidate mechanism for
producing neurodevelopmental susceptibility to schizophrenia
requiring proper NMDAR signaling (6). Overlapping putative
miR-132 target genes with developmentally regulated genes led to
the conﬁrmation of Dnmt3a and Dpysl3 as targets strongly downregulated in the PFC during this period. Both genes contain miR132 binding sites in their 3′ UTR, and show expression patterns
that are the inverse of miR-132 expression. Dnmt3a is a de novo
DNA methyltransferase in brain (37), and Dpysl3 is an NMDARregulated phosphoprotein involved in neurite outgrowth (38).
Diminished miR-132 expression and resulting abnormal expression of Dpysl3 at this stage of development would be expected to
negatively affect synaptic activity and outgrowth. These results
suggest that miR-132 might play an important role in the pattern of
gene expression in the PFC during adolescent neurodevelopment.
A second major process during late neurodevelopment is
maturation of prefrontal GABAergic interneurons (39).
GABAergic interneurons target excitatory pyramidal neurons,
and the selective deletion of NR1 subunits in parvalbumin-positive neurons during postnatal development results in the appearance of schizophrenia-like behaviors in adulthood (40).
Given the suggested role of miR-132 in potentiation of NMDAR
signaling, abnormalities in miR-132 expression during this critical period may disrupt the molecular maturation of GABA
interneurons. A core molecular characteristic of schizophrenia is
reduced expression of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD67,
encoded by the GAD1 gene, and hypermethylation of schizophrenia risk genes, including GAD1 and REELIN, has been
proposed as a cause of reduced GAD67 expression in schizophrenia (41). Notably, one of the miR-132 targets most strongly
repressed during the period of peak miR-132 expression in adolescent mice is Dnmt3a, a DNA methyltransferase and conﬁrmed miR-132 target. Reduced miR-132 levels in adolescents
at risk for schizophrenia would be predicted to result in derepression of DNMT3A and subsequent hypermethylation of the
genes targeted by DNMT3A. Our data do not prove a direct
interaction between miR-132 and DNMT3A. However, we
demonstrate that miR-132 regulates—directly or indirectly—
RNA and protein levels of this important DNA methyltransferase. Furthermore, inhibition of NMDA signaling results in abnormal up-regulation of Dnmt3a expression in adulthood. The
ultimate effect is still speculative, as the functions of the DNMT
family members often overlap and may compensate for dysregulation of one family member.
Our results suggest that miR-132 down-regulation in the DLPFC is a common molecular characteristic of schizophrenia and
is associated with developmental and adult dysregulation of
a number of miR-132 target genes, including p250GAP and
DNMT3A. More broadly, other groups have reported that
miRNA biogenesis is disrupted in patients with the 22q11 deletion, which causes schizophrenia-like symptoms (42), and
a recent genome-wide association study report has linked miR137 with schizophrenia (43). Although dysregulation of miR-137
has yet to be observed in schizophrenia, several of its potential
biological functions overlap with those of miR-132, and the miR132 target MECP2 regulates miR-137 expression (44). The
ability of a single miRNA to coregulate the function of many
genes within related signaling pathways suggests that dysregulation of miRNA expression has widespread biological consequences. Therefore, these recent studies linking miRNA dysrePNAS | February 21, 2012 | vol. 109 | no. 8 | 3129

NEUROSCIENCE

in the PFC of schizophrenic subjects, including GATA2, PDE7B,
ANKRD11, P250GAP, and FKBP2. We determined that expression of miR-132 in the PFC is regulated during development
and by NMDAR signaling in the mouse. Finally, we demonstrated that several genes associated with neurodevelopment
in mice and schizophrenia in humans, including DNMT3A,
GATA2, and DPYSL3, are regulated by miR-132.

gulation with schizophrenia have signiﬁcant implications for both
our understanding of the biological underpinnings of complex
neuropsychiatric disorders and for development of novel, more
effective therapeutics.
Materials and Methods

(Gata2, Dpyls3, Dnmt3a) was evaluated by 3′ UTR luciferase reporter assays,
as previously described (28), or by Western blot analysis, using lentiviral
constructs to transduce HEK293 cells with miR-132 overexpression or sponge
cassettes. Animal experiments were performed on C57BL/6J mice from the
Jackson Laboratory, or Sprague-Dawley rats from Taconic. Full experimental
details are available in the SI Materials and Methods.

MiRNA microarray analysis was performed on 100 RNA samples from SMRI
(Table S1). Subsequent qPCR analysis for miRNA and mRNA expression was
performed on both SMRI and RNA from the HBB tissues. IPA and NextBio
software were used for in silico analysis. The effect of miR-132 overexpression on three of the potential miR-132 targets identiﬁed above
