MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate gene expression by partial
complementarity to the 3# untranslated region of their target
genes, have been implicated in cancer initiation and progression.
However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation
of miRNA expression during pancreatic tumorigenesis has not
been extensively reported. In this study, we first compared the
miRNA expression in human pancreatic cancers and adjacent
normal tissues by miRNA array and identified 12 differentially
expressed miRNAs. miR-132, which is downregulated in tumors,
was further studied in greater detail. Decreased expression of
miR-132 was confirmed in 16 of 20 pancreatic carcinomas
(P < 0.0001), compared with their respective benign tissues by
TaqMan miRNA assays. miR-132 expression was remarkably
influenced by promoter methylation in PANC1 and SW1990 cells.
Promoter hypermethylation was observed in tumor samples but
not in the normal counterparts, and the expression of miR-132
negatively correlated with its methylation status (P 5 0.013).
miR-132 was transcribed by RNA polymerase II, and Sp1 played
a major role in miR-132 transcription. The expression of Sp1
correlated with that of miR-132 in tissues. Moreover, cancerous
tissues showed significantly lower Sp1-binding affinity to the miR132 promoter, relative to non-tumor samples. Proliferation and
colony formation of pancreatic cancer cells were suppressed in
cells transfected with miR-132 mimics and enhanced in cells
transfected with miR-132 inhibitor by negatively regulating the
Akt-signaling pathway. Our present findings illustrate the mechanism driving miR-132 downregulation and the important role of
miR-132 in pancreatic cancer development.

for therapeutic intervention (3). At this stage, several genetic and
epigenetic changes have taken place, resulting in the silencing of
tumor suppressors, overexpression of oncogenes and ultimately tumor
progression (4). In recent years, there have been important advances
in understanding the molecular biology of pancreatic cancer and genetic analyses have shown that the basis of this dismal disease is
extremely complex and heterogenous (5).
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding regulatory RNAs
that suppress gene expression through partial complementary
elements in the 3# untranslated regions of their target messenger
RNAs (mRNAs) (6). Most animal miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved and are often found in clusters (7). Primary miRNAs with the
stem-loop structure are transcribed by RNA polymerases (RNA
Pols) and are processed both in the nucleus and cytoplasm by Drosha
and Dicer to generate mature miRNAs (8,9). The mature miRNA is
assembled into a miRNA-induced silencing complex, which then
directs its binding to the cognate sequence in the 3# untranslated
region of the target mRNAs. miRNAs are implicated in a wide
variety of biological processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis,
metabolism, cell differentiation and tumor initiation and promotion (10), and their identification may provide new insights in the
elucidation of cancer progression (11). Over the past several years,
advanced technologies have been used to quantify miRNAs in
pancreatic tumor tissues and several deregulated miRNAs have
recently been revealed including miR-21, miR-146, miR-221 and
miR-196a (12).
These findings suggest the involvement of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. The deregulation of miRNAs might be
attributed to disorders in transcription and subsequent procession.
Therefore, transcriptional regulation of miRNAs may represent an
underexplored etiology of pancreatic cancer. However, few studies
have demonstrated the mechanism of miRNA transcription during
the development of pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, the regulatory
role of only a few miRNAs has been elucidated in pancreatic cancer
initiation and progression. More extensive investigations of miRNA
function are warranted.
In this study, we first analyzed miRNA expression between normal
and cancerous pancreatic tissues and identified 12 preferentially expressed miRNAs. We further investigated the underlying mechanism
of miR-132 transcription and the consequence of its deregulation.
Cis-modulating elements and trans-factors were identified in the
miR-132 promoter. Downregulation of miR-132 in tumors was
caused by promoter hypermethylation and decreased Sp1-binding
affinity to its promoter. Moreover, miR-132 attenuates proliferation
and colony formation of pancreatic cancer cells via the Akt-signaling
pathway.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with one of the worst
mortality. It is the sixth leading cause of death from malignant disease
in China and the fourth leading cause of cancer related death in the
USA (1,2). The majority of patients have developed an aggressive
form of the disease by the time of diagnosis, limiting the potential

Tissue samples
Twenty pancreatic cancer tissue samples and matched normal adjacent pancreatic tissue samples were obtained postoperatively in 2009 from the Department of General Surgery, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical
University (Shanghai, China). All patients gave signed, informed consent for
their tissues to be used for scientific research. Ethical approval for the study
was obtained from the Department of General Surgery, Changhai Hospital,
Second Military Medical University (Shanghai, China). All diagnoses were
based on pathological and/or cytological evidence. The histological features of
the specimens were evaluated by a senior pathologist according to the WHO
classification criteria. Tissues were obtained before chemotherapy and radiation therapy and were immediately frozen and stored at 80°C prior to
the microarray, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and methylation
analyses.

miRNA microarray and real-time PCR analyses
Total RNA was extracted from cells or tissues with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Microarray-based miRNA expression profiling was performed
using the miRCURY LNA human microRNA Array (Exiqon, Vedbaek,
Denmark). The microarrays contained 1200 assay probes corresponding to
all of the annotated human and non-human primate miRNA sequences (miRBase, version 12, 2008; the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridgeshire,
UK). Total RNA labeling and hybridization were performed using standard
conditions according to manufacturer instructions.
The expression levels of mature miR-132/212 and their precursor were
quantified by quantitative real-time PCR using TaqMan MicroRNA assays
according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). Briefly, 5 ng of small RNA or total RNA were reverse transcribed using
specific stem-loop RT primers, after which they were amplified and detected
using PCR with specific primers and TaqMan probes. U6 snRNA (RNU6B;
Applied Biosystems) served as an internal normalized reference. Thermocycler
conditions included an initial step at 95°C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles at
95°C for 15 s and 55°C for 1 min. The quantitative real-time PCR results were
analyzed and expressed as relative miRNA or mRNA levels based on the Ct
(cycle threshold) value, which was then converted to fold change.
Cell culture and demethylation experiment
The human pancreatic cancer cell lines SW1990 and PANC1 were maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin G Sodium Salt and 100 U/ml
streptomycin sulfate; Gibco, Grand Island, NY). The cells were grown in a
37°C incubator with 5% CO2.
To block DNA methylation, SW1990 and PANC1 cells were treated with
10 lM 5-aza-2#-deoxycytidine (5-Aza; Sigma–Aldrich, St Louis, MO) for
72 h. The cells were then collected for mRNA analysis.
DNA extraction and bisulfite sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from 20 pairs of pancreatic tissues using the
sodium dodecyl sulfate and proteinase K methods and then subjected to sodium
bisulfite treatment (13). We amplified and sequenced the proximal promoter
DNA from 1425 to 1161 (relative to the transcription start site). This region
contains 14 CpG sites. These regions were amplified using the primers
(forward) 5#-GGTTTTTAGTTTTTGGGTGGTATTT-3#; (reverse) 5#-CCCTCCTCAATTCCTAAACCTAA-3#. The initial denaturation was for 2 min at
96°C, followed by 32 cycles for 10 s at 94°C, 5 s at 54°C and 10 s at 72°C and
a final elongation for 7 min at 72°C. The PCR products were separated by 2%
agarose gel electrophoresis, extracted and then cloned into the T-easy vector
(Tiangen, China). After bacterial amplification of the cloned PCR fragments by
standard procedures, 10 clones were subjected to DNA sequencing.
Construction of promoter reporter plasmids
To explore the transcriptional regulation of miR-132, a fragment of the miR132 gene promoter (2668 to 74 relative to the transcription start site of primiR-212/132) was amplified by PCR using the following primers: (forward)
5#-TACTCGAGTTCTGTAAGGGAGGGTCTCACA-3# and (reverse) 5#-CTAAGCTTGCTCGCGACCAGGCACG-3# (underlined nucleotide sequence
means restriction enzyme cutting site). The amplified fragment was inserted
into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) between the XhoI and
HindIII sites. This pGL3-2668 vector was used as a template for the cloning of
serially deleted miR-132 promoter reporter vectors with the same reverse
primer and the forward primers described in Supplementary Table 1, available
at Carcinogenesis Online. These recombination plasmids were then sequenced
for confirmation. The pcDNA3.1-Sp1, pcDNA3.1-Oct-1 and pcDNA3.1-cyclic
adenosine 3#,5#-monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) vectors,
which can the overexpress corresponding transcription factor, were gifts from
Dr Wenzhang Wang (Fudan University, China).
In vitro DNA methylation of constructs
The pGL3-2668 construct was methylated in vitro using the bacterial methylase
SssI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Briefly, each reporter gene construct (4 lg) was incubated at 37°C for 4 h with 40 U of SssI supplemented with
160 lM S-adenosylmethionine. After methylation, the plasmid was purified
and quantified.
Cell transfection and luciferase assays
PANC1 and SW1990 cells were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 1 lg of each constructed vector, either methylated or unmethylated.
To confirm the participation of transcription factors, 200 ng of the transcription
factor expression vector or control vector (pcDNA3.1) was cotransfected with
800 ng of the constructed reporter vector. In each transfection, 50 ng of pRLTK (Promega) was used to correct for the transfection efficiency. Luciferase
activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System

(Promega). Promoter activities were expressed as the ratio of Firefly luciferase
to Renilla luciferase activity. Chemically synthesized RNAs, including negative control (NC), miR-132 mimics and miR-132 inhibitor, were obtained from
GenePharma (GenePharma, Shanghai, China). For transfection, the cells were
transfected with 1 lg of the chemically synthesized RNA.
Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation
Cells and pancreatic tissues were used for the chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assays. We used the EZ ChIP Kit (Upstate, Biotechnology, Lake Placid,
NY) and followed the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 5  106 cells or 30
mg of the tissues were cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde, lysed in 400 ll lysis
buffer and sonicated to 500 bp fragments. ChIP was conducted with antibodies against RNA polymerase (RNA Pol) II, RNA PolIII, Sp1, CREB and
IgG. Input control DNA or immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified in a 15 ll
reaction volume containing 2 ll of the eluted DNA template. We designed
eight sets of primers targeting different regions in the pri-miR-212/132 promoter (supplementary Table 2 is available at Carcinogenesis Online). Both the
immunoprecipitated fragments and the inputs were amplified by real-time
PCR. The results for the immunoprecipitated fragments were calculated and
compared with the Ct values obtained for the input samples in each case. The
results are expressed as a percentage of the input.
Cell proliferation assays
Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1  104 cells per well and
incubated for 96 h. In vitro growth was measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8
(CCK-8) (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). The optical density (OD)
at 450 nm was measured using a Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA),
and the proliferation index was calculated as experimental OD value/control
OD value. Three independent experiments were performed in quadruplicate.
Colony formation
PANC1 and SW1990 cells transfected with the indicated RNAs were plated at
low density (1000 cells/6 cm plate), incubated for 10 days and fixed and stained
with crystal violet. Foci and colonies containing .50 cells were counted using
a microscope.
Western blot
Treated cells in a six-well culture cluster were washed twice with ice-old phosphate-buffered saline and then directly lysed in 200 ll of 2 sodium dodecyl
sulfate cell lysis buffer in each well. The lysates were boiled, centrifuged at
10 000 r.p.m. and then loaded onto a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. The samples were electrophoresed for 4 h and
then transferred to a Millipore Immobilon transfer membrane in Bio-Rad blot
apparatus. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk in phosphate-buffered salineTween-20 for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were blotted with the
appropriate Akt, pAkt, P70, external signal-regulated kinase (ERK), pERK,
cyclin D1 or pJNK primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA) at a 1:1000–1:2000 dilution. Membranes were then incubated with the
appropriate secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase at a 1:2000
dilution for 1 h at room temperature. After TBST washes, the blot was incubated
in detection reagent (ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection Kit, Amersham
Bioscience, Freiburg, Germany) and exposed to a Hyperfilm ECL film (Pierce,
Rockford, IL). b-Actin served as the loading control and was detected with
a mouse monoclonal anti-b-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Statistical analysis
Data from at least three independent experiments are expressed as the mean ±
standard error of the mean. Standard error bars are included for all data points.
The differences between groups were analyzed using Student’s t-test when
only two groups were present or by one-way analysis of variance when more
than two groups were compared. Correlation analysis was performed using the
Pearson test. All tests performed were two sided. Data were considered significant if P , 0.05 (indicated by ‘ ’) and P , 0.001 (indicated by ‘ ’).

Results
miRNA-132 is downregulated in pancreatic cancer
To search for miRNAs that may be involved in the development of
pancreatic cancer, especially among Chinese patients, we collected
three different human clinical specimens and used miRNA array analysis to screen for differentially expressed miRNAs between pancreatic cancer tissues and respective adjacent normal tissues. The raw
array measures are accessible through Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) Series accession number GSE28862 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc5GSE28862). We found that many

miRNAs were deregulated in these cancer samples, including miR-21,
miR-365, miR-103 and miR-141 (Table I). In addition, the expression
of miR-132, which had not been suggested to be involved in pancreatic cancer in previous studies, was significantly downregulated in
pancreatic malignant tissues. To further confirm the expression of
miR-132, we extended our sample to twenty different clinical specimens. Taqman-based real-time PCR analysis showed that miR-132
was significantly decreased in 16 of 20 carcinoma tissues compared
with the matched adjacent tissues (P , 0.0001; Figure 1A), suggest-

ing that miR-132 may be a novel factor associated with the development of pancreatic cancer. Because miR-132 and miR-212 are derived
from the same precursor pri-miR-212/132, we also detected the expression of pri-miR-212/132 and mature miR-212. The expression of
pri-miR-212/132 was significantly reduced in cancerous tissues (P 5
0.006; Figure 1B), and its expression correlated with mature miR-132
(r 5 0.467, P 5 0.024). However, mature miR-212 did not show
a significant alternation between tumors and the non-tumor counterparts (P 5 0.065, Figure 1C). Interestingly, the expression of mature
miR-212 correlated with that of its precursor (r 5 0.452, P 5 0.045)
but not with that of mature miR-132 (r 5 0.024, P 5 0.919).
The miR-132 promoter is hypermethylated in pancreatic carcinomas
Transcriptional regulation plays a pivotal role in miRNA expression.
The human miR-212/132 cluster is far from the annotated genes in
chromosome 17 and thus is postulated to be located intergenically
and transcribed via its own promoter. We first predicted the presence
of CpG islands in the pri-miR-212/132 promoter. The CpG Island
Searcher program (http://www.uscnorris.com/cpgislands2/cpg.aspx)
helped us to identify a dense CpG island near the transcription start
site of pri-miR-212/132, which indicates that the mature miR-132 and
its precursor may potentially be regulated through DNA methylation.
To clarify the possible roles of this epigenetic mechanism of miR-132
silencing in cell lines, we treated two pancreatic cancer cell lines
(PANC1 and SW1990) with 5-Aza, a methyltransferase inhibitor.
We found that the treatment of cells with 5-Aza significantly elevated

promoter in the tissue samples. The 20 coupled biopsies were obtained from fresh surgical resection. The expression level of miR-132 (A), miR-212 (B) and primiR-212/132 (C) was measured in triplicate by Taqman real-time PCR analysis. T (tumor)/N (non-tumor) relative miRNA expression ratios between normalized

sample than in the respective adjacent control tissue. (D) DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza stimulated the expression of pri-miR-212/132, miR-212 and miR-132

the expression of pri-miR-212/132 and its two mature products (miR132 and miR-212) in both cell lines (Figure 1D), indicating the existence of epigenetic regulation in their promoter.
To further illustrate the methylation status of the pri-miR-212/132
promoter, sodium bisulfite sequencing assay was used. Genomic DNA
from six pancreatic cancer tissues showed hypermethylation in
the miR-132 promoter, whereas only a few methylated cytosines in
CpG dinucleotides were detected in the respective non-cancerous
tissues (Figure 1E). Statistical analysis further revealed that the mean
methylation level negatively correlated with miR-132 expression
(r 5 0.668, P 5 0.013; Figure 1F) but not with miR-212 expression.
These data indicated that methylation was involved in the reduced
expression of miR-132 during pancreatic cancer development.
The miR-132 promoter contains cis-modulating elements and transfactors
To find the cis-regulatory elements of the miR-132 promoter, fragments from positions 2668, 1205, 754 and 445 to position 74
in the miR-132 promoter were cloned into a luciferase reporter
plasmid and their transcriptional activity was assessed in pancreatic
cancer cells (Figure 2B). We found that in both PANC1 and SW1990

cells, deletion of the region from 2668 to 1205 did not obviously
affect the reporter activity, whereas further deletion to position 754
significantly reduced the activity (Figure 3B), suggesting that the region between 1205 and 754 in the promoter is a cis-activating
element for miR-132 expression.
To further explore the trans-factors of miR-132 transcription, bioinformatic tool Alibaba2.1 (available at http://www.gene-regulation.
com/pub/programs/alibaba2/index.html; Min mat. Conservation 80%
and minimum number of sites 5) was used to predict potential transcription factors in the pri-miR-212/132 promoter. The results revealed
that abundant putative binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1
were present (Figure 2A), indicating that this cis-element is a major
transcription factor in pri-miR-212/132 transcription. Other trans-acting factors such as activator protein 2 and CREB were also predicted.
To examine whether Sp1 and CREB could regulate the expression
of miR-212 and miR-132, the pGL3-2668 vector was cotransfected
with different transcription factors in PANC1 and SW1990 cells. The
expression of the reporter was found to be remarkably upregulated
to 8.1-fold upon Sp1 cotransfection in PANC1 and to 6.8-fold in
SW1990 cells (Figure 2C), suggesting that the interplay between
Sp1 and the pri-miR-212/132 proximal promoter is involved in the

is the first base of each truncated promoter. (C) Transcription factors were involved in the transactivation of the pri-miR-212/132 promoter. The pGL3-2668 vector
coupled with the pri-miR-212/132 was cotransfected with the transcription factor overexpression vector or control vector in PANC1 and SW1990 cells. Each value
represents the average of at least three independent experiments. (D) Sp1 and methylation status affected the pri-miR-212/132 promoter activity. The reporter
constructs examined were either untreated (UT) or treated with SssI to methylate the DNA. (E) mRNA levels of endogenous miR-132 (relative to U6)
showed a significant positive correlation with Sp1 expression (relative to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; P , 0.0001, r 5 0.589) but not with that of
CREB (P 5 0.205, r 5 0.204) or Oct-1 (P 5 -0.191, r 5 0.237).

Downregulation of miR-132 in pancreatic cancer

regulation of miR-132 in pancreatic cancer. In addition, CREB significantly increased the reporter expression to 1.4-fold in SW1990
cells.
We were intrigued by whether the expression levels of miR-132
correlated with that of the transcription factors in the tissue samples.
Using quantitative real-time PCR, we found that endogenous miR132 levels significantly correlated with that of Sp1 (P , 0.0001,
r 5 0.589; Figure 2E) but not with CREB (P 5 0.205, r 5 0.204)
or Oct-1 (P 5 0.191, r 5 0.237).
Hypermethylation eliminates Sp1 binding in the miR-132 proximal
promoter
Hypermethylation may destroy the accessibility of transcription
factors to promoters. Therefore, we treated the pGL3-2668 construct with the methylase SssI to mimic the hypermethylation status
of the pri-miR-212/132 promoter in vivo and then examined its
activity in PANC1 and SW1990 cells. Methylated pGL3-2668
showed remarkably reduced luciferase activities relative to the
unmethylated reporter, indicating that hypermethylation could substantially cripple its expression (Figure 2D). Moreover, Sp1 stimulation of the methylated pGL-2668 reporter (,3-fold) was much
lower than that of the unmethylated construct, suggesting that hypermethylation of the pri-miR-212/132 promoter might abrogate
Sp1 binding and transactivation.
Next, using ChIP assays, we explored the active region for the
binding of RNA polymerases and transcription factors within 3 kb
upstream of the pri-miR-212/132 promoter. In both PANC1 and
SW1990 cells, we observed significant enrichment of PolII binding

from 1269 bp, whereas PolIII was unlikely to show binding affinity
to the pri-miR-212/132 promoter (Figure 3A and B). Moreover, the
transcription factor Sp1 displayed the highest binding affinity at Region 5 (region labeled ‘5’ in Figure 2A; 1269 to 1133 relative to
the transcription start site). The occupancy for CREB was relatively
weak at Region 7 and Region 8. Additionally, we used quantitative
ChIP to detect the relative binding amount of Sp1 in both normal and
cancerous pancreatic tissues at the eight regions in 10 matched tissues.
We found that the in vivo Sp1 binding was reduced to 52% in Region
5 and 38% in Region 6 for pancreatic cancer tissues relative to normal
tissues (Figure 3C); this result may be a consequence of hypermethylation in the pri-miR-212/132 proximal promoter.
Inhibition of miRNA-132 in pancreatic cancer cell promotes cell
proliferation and colony formation
Because our above results indicated that miR-132 expression was
reduced in pancreatic cancers and that miR-132 might act as a tumor
suppressor, we next tried to explore the function of miR-132 in pancreatic cancer development. The CCK-8 proliferation assay showed
that miR-132 mimics significantly repressed the proliferation of
PANC1 cells (Figure 4A). Colony formation analysis consistently
demonstrated that miR-132 mimics inhibited SW1990 and PANC1
cells and causes them to grow less and in smaller colonies (Figure
4B). Conversely, anti-miR-132 transfection in PANC1 and SW1990
cells significantly stimulated cell proliferation (Figure 4A) and resulted in increased PANC1 or 1990 PANC1 colony foci (Figure
4B). These results suggest that miR-132 attenuates the proliferation
and anchorage-independent growth of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro.

The Akt-signaling pathway is involved in miR-132-induced cancer
cell suppression
To investigate the pathways implicated in the miR-132-induced suppression of cancer cells, we analyzed the expression of signaling of
pathways using western blot analysis. In agreement with the growth
disadvantage, the phosphorylation of Akt and expression of cyclin D1
were strongly downregulated after miR-132 transfection, whereas the
protein level of Akt remained unchanged (Figure 4C). In contrast, the
expression and/or phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and P70 were not
changed. These results demonstrated that the Akt pathway is involved
in miR-132-induced suppression of cancer cells.

Discussion
In this study, using miRNA array analysis of human clinical specimens,
we found that six miRNAs were overexpressed and six were underexpressed in pancreatic cancer tissues compared with respective adjacent
benign pancreatic tissues. Our finding shared some differentially
expressed miRNAs in common with previous studies. Notably, similar to earlier reports, miR-21 is uniquely overexpressed in pancreatic cancers; this miRNA plays a role in increasing cell proliferation,
invasion and chemoresistance to gemcitabine (14–16). miR-365 is
upregulated in primary breast cancer compared with normal adjacent
tumor tissues (17). miR-141, a member of the miR-200 family, is
downregulated in gastric, pancreatic, prostate, hepatocellular and
renal cell carcinoma (18–20). Our data add to the list of miRNAs
with aberrant expression in pancreatic cancer. The decreased expression of miR-132 was consistent upon further validation in 20 pairs
of tissues. miR-132 and miR-212 are derived from the same primiRNA transcript. In the microarray analysis and Taqman real-time
PCR analysis, we did not observe a significant correlation between
the expression of the two miRNAs and miR-212 did not show a significant alternation in expression between pancreatic tissues and
matched non-tumor tissues. It was found that the miR-212/132
cluster was found to be able to produce four miRNAs in mice:
miR-132, miR-132 , miR-212 and miR-212 . Among the four miRNAs, miR-132 is found to be the predominantly active product in
hippocampal neurons (21). We postulate that the processing of miR132 and miR-212 in human pancreatic tissues was imbalanced and

that posttranscriptional regulation of miRNA plays a role in this
imbalance.
Rat miR-132 is located in an intron but is transcribed independently
(22). Our results show that the upstream region of miR-132 harbors
RNA PolII-binding sites and can mediate transcription of a luciferase
reporter, suggesting that it is transcribed via its own promoter. RNA
PolIII was initially believed to mediate miRNA transcription because
it transcribes most small RNAs such as tRNAs and U6 snRNA
(23,24). However, evidences have shown that pri-miRNAs are structurally analogous to mRNAs (25). Pri-miRNAs are mainly transcribed
by RNA PolII, yet some miRNAs are transcribed by RNA PolIII
(26,27). Here, using ChIP analysis, we found that the miR-212/132
promoter could recruit RNA PolII but not RNA PolIII, suggesting that
pri-miR-212/132 is transcribed via RNA PolII. Besides RNA Pol,
transcription factors are required for the activation of miR-132. CREB
protein has been identified in the regulation of miR-132 in rat neurons
and human primary lymphatic endothelial cells by a genome-wide
screen (22,28). One of the CREB-binding sites lies in a region between miR-212 and miR-132. This CREB-binding region is conserved between human and rat. Consistent with this finding, we
detected CREB binding in Regions 7 and 8. Importantly, transcription
of miR-132 is influenced more by Sp1 than by CREB in human
pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, our study explored the reason
for the miR-132 expression difference. CpG methylation is one of the
epigenetic mechanisms for miRNA deregulation in cancer. We found
that promoter hypermethylation and reduced Sp1-binding affinity resulted in the underexpression of miR-132 in tumor tissues. Because
Sp1 can recruit histone deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase to
repress transcription (29,30), it is not clear whether methylation of
the miR-132 promoter is induced by Sp1 or whether hypermethylation
of the promoter abrogates Sp1 binding.
The functions and target genes of miR-132 have gradually been
illustrated. miR-132 regulates neuronal morphogenesis by decreasing levels of the GTPase-activating protein, p250GAP21 (22) and
regulates antiviral innate immunity through suppression of the p300
transcriptional coactivator (28). In addition, miR-132 acts as an angiogenic switch by suppressing endothelial p120RasGAP expression,
leading to Ras activation and the induction of neovascularization (31).
Since each miRNA can regulate numerous target protein-coding
genes, its function can be interpreted as the sum of the functions of
the genes it regulates (32). In this study, we did not investigate the

Downregulation of miR-132 in pancreatic cancer

direct targets of miR-132. Instead, we analyzed the consequence of
miR-132 deregulation in pancreatic cancer progression. Ectopic
expression of miR-132 inhibited cell proliferation colony formation, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Several signaling pathways regulate cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression such as
the mitogen-activated protein kinase–ERK and the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase–Akt pathways (33,34). Overexpression of miR-132
reduced Akt phosphorylation and cyclin D1 expression but not expression or phosphorylation of ERK and JNK, indicating that miR-132
exerts its tumor repressing function through inactivation of the Aktsignaling pathway. Activation of Akt occurs frequently in pancreatic
cancer and is of significant prognostic value; this protein has been suggested as a target for pancreatic cancer therapy (35,36). Cyclin D1,
a downstream effector of the Akt pathway, promotes pancreatic cancer
cell proliferation (37). Because genes involved in the Akt pathway are
not predicted to be direct targets of miR-132 by the bioinformatic tools
TragetScan 5.1 and PicTar, inactivation of the Akt-signaling pathway
may be a consequence of the miR-132 regulatory network.
Taken together, our study illustrates the mechanism driving miR132 transcription and the role of miR-132 in pancreatic cancer. miR132 acts as a tumor suppressor via inactivation of the Akt pathway.
This report contributes to the understanding of the role of miR-132
in pancreatic cancer progression and the diagnostic and therapeutic
potential for pancreatic cancer.
