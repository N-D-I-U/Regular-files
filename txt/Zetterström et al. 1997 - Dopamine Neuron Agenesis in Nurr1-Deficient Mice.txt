Dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area regulate movement
and affective behavior and degenerate in Parkinson’s disease. The orphan nuclear
receptor Nurr1 was shown to be expressed in developing dopamine neurons before the
appearance of known phenotypic markers for these cells. Mice lacking Nurr1 failed to
generate midbrain dopaminergic neurons, were hypoactive, and died soon after birth.
Nurr1 expression continued into adulthood, and brains of heterozygous animals, otherwise apparently healthy, contained reduced dopamine levels. These results suggest
that putative Nurr1 ligands may be useful for treatment of Parkinson’s disease and other
disorders of midbrain dopamine circuitry.

adrenals, thymus, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, or intestine. Peripheral nerves, spinal
cord, and dorsal root ganglia appeared normal in Nurr1–/– mice as judged by laminin,
protein gene product 9.5, neurofilament,
and calcitonin gene-related peptide immunohistochemistry (6).
Nurr1 mRNA is expressed in substantia
nigra pars compacta (SNC) and the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) (5). Expression appears at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) in the
ventral aspect of the mesencephalic flexure
where DA neurons later develop but before
known phenotypic markers for DA neurons
such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) can be
detected (Fig. 2). TH immunoreactivity
(IR) (6) was absent in Nurr1–/– mice in the
ventral midbrain where TH-positive cell
groups (defined as A8 through A10) (7) are
normally present (Fig. 2, E and H). TH-IR
was present in newborn Nurr1–/– mice in
other areas known to express TH (Fig. 2, F,
G, I, and J). TH-IR, normally appearing in
the developing midbrain at approximately
E11.5 in mouse (8), was absent throughout
all prenatal stages (from E11.5 to newborn;
Fig. 2, K through N). Therefore, the data
suggest that Nurr1 is critical for midbrain

Dopamine (DA) midbrain neurons function in the control of movement and their
loss is the cause of Parkinson’s disease.
Mechanisms underlying dopaminergic development are largely unknown. Whereas
general induction of ventral cell fate requires the secreted factor sonic hedgehog
(1), additional factors must contribute to
differentiation of specific cell types such as
DA neurons. Glial cell line– derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived
neurotrophic factor have been demonstrated to promote survival of DA cells (2), but
the absence of these factors does not affect
prenatal DA neuron development (3). In
contrast, Nurr1, an orphan member of the
steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family
(4), which is expressed in DA cells (5), was
found to be absolutely required for development of midbrain DA neurons.
Nurr1 genomic DNA was used to construct a targeting vector (Fig. 1A) in which
a neomycin phosphotransferase gene replaced the NH2-terminal transactivation
and DNA-binding domains of Nurr1. From
cross-breeding of heterozygous Nurr1 mutant mice, we obtained homozygous animals
(Nurr1–/–; Fig. 1, B and C) born at the
expected frequency of 25% without apparent abnormalities. Homozygous mice could
be distinguished after birth by hypoactivity
and the lack of milk in their stomachs and
died within the first 2 days after birth.
Histology of mutants did not reveal any
gross morphological abnormalities of brain,

dopaminergic cell differentiation.
Although Nurr1 may directly activate
transcription of the TH gene, this seems
unlikely as most TH-positive cell groups do
not express Nurr1 mRNA (5), and these
other cell groups were TH immunoreactive
in Nurr12/2 mice (Fig. 2). Instead, Nurr1
appears to determine the specific dopaminergic cell fate. Analysis of cresyl violet–
stained sections (6) revealed a disorganized
distribution of cells in the ventral midbrain
of Nurr1–/– mice, suggesting that TH-expressing neurons fail to differentiate. In situ
hybridization showed that Nurr1 mRNA
was expressed in SNC and VTA in wildtype animals, whereas no hybridization signal was detected in Nurr1–/– mice (Fig. 3, A
and B). Neither TH-IR nor TH mRNA
(Fig. 3, C and D) was found in mutant
midbrains. Additional DA neuron markers,
including aldehyde dehydrogenase 2
(ADH2) (9), mRNA for the GDNF signal
transducing receptor c-Ret (Fig. 3, E
through H) (10), and the DA D2 receptor
were also absent in SNC and VTA in
Nurr1–/– mice.
The cause of death in Nurr1–/– mice is
not clear although it appears to involve
inability to suckle. Mutant mice display
movement disturbances including severe
difficulties in turning when placed on their
backs and abnormal flexion-extension
movements of limbs. The cause of death
does not seem to involve competition with
normal littermates, because litter restriction
did not influence survival of the mutant
pups. In mice where the TH gene was disrupted in dopaminergic cells, homozygotes
survived 2 weeks after birth (11). Such
delayed death is consistent with the postnatal course of development of striatal DA
innervation (12) and suggests that perinatal
lack of midbrain DA is not immediately
lethal. However, absence of DA neurons, as
is the case in the Nurr1–/– mice, rather than
lack of transmitter, is accompanied by additional deficits in neuropeptides and neuronal circuitry (13). Alternatively, Nurr1

levels appeared somewhat reduced, in
agreement with previous studies of mice
deficient in the DA D1 receptor, as well as
DA (11, 17).
High-pressure liquid chromatography
(HPLC) was used to measure levels of DA
and the DA metabolite DOPAC in pieces
of striatum and ventral midbrain (18). DA
was absent in Nurr1–/– animals (Fig. 4C).
Newborn heterozygotes showed reduced
levels of DA (Fig. 4C) and DOPAC, indicating that nigrostriatal DA levels are affected by Nurr1 gene dosage. Adult heterozygotes also manifested reduced striatal

Striatum develops many organotypic
features in genetically engineered DA-deficient mice (11) after perinatal ablation
of dopaminergic neurons (15) or when
grafted into 6-hydroxy-DA–lesioned adult
rat brains (16). Our data support these
findings. We found that mRNAs encoding
enkephalin, substance P (Fig. 4, A and B),
and choline acetyltransferase were normally distributed in striatum of Nurr1 mutant brains, although substance P mRNA

DA levels (P , 0.01) but no apparent
histological or behavioral abnormalities.
This indicates that Nurr1 helps maintain
the differentiated DA neuron phenotype in
mature animals and suggests that DA levels
could be regulated by Nurr1 ligands.
Understanding DA neuron development will involve elucidating the relationship of Nurr1 to sonic hedgehog signaling
and to other regulatory components involved in midbrain patterning and cell
fate specification (1, 19). Nurr1 can promote signaling through heterodimerization with the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor,
RXR (20). The enzyme ADH2, used here
as a DA neuron marker, may have importance for retinoid synthesis (9). Thus, retinoids may activate RXR-Nurr1 heterodimers in developing DA neurons. Further insight into how retinoids, as well as
a putative ligand for Nurr1, may influence
the development and survival of DA neurons may provide opportunities for pharmacological intervention to manage the
function of dopaminergic neurons.

were excised and the targeting construct was transfected into E14 embryonic stem (ES) cells. G418-resistant clones in which Nurr1 had been targeted were
identified by Southern (DNA) blotting, using a 1-kb
Nurr1 probe located 59 of Nurr1 sequences in the targeting construct, ensuring that the authentic Nurr1 locus was detected. ES cells from three independent
clones were injected into C57Bl6 recipient blastocysts

Bacterial pathogenesis requires proteins that sense host microenvironments and respond by regulating virulence gene transcription. For Salmonellae, one such regulatory
system is PhoP-PhoQ, which regulates genes required for intracellular survival and
resistance to cationic peptides. Analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that Salmonella
typhimurium PhoP-PhoQ regulated structural modifications of lipid A, the host signaling
portion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), by the addition of aminoarabinose and 2-hydroxymyristate. Structurally modified lipid A altered LPS-mediated expression of the adhesion
molecule E-selectin by endothelial cells and tumor necrosis factor–a expression by
adherent monocytes. Thus, altered responses to environmentally induced lipid A structural modifications may represent a mechanism for bacteria to gain advantage within host
tissues.

Pathogenic bacteria coordinately express
virulence genes in response to eukaryotic
microenvironments (1). For many pathogens, this requires sensing and transcriptional activation involving two proteins
that form a phosphorelay mechanism. In
Salmonellae, one such system comprises a
sensor kinase, PhoQ, and a transcriptional
activator, PhoP (2, 3). This system can
simultaneously activate and repress more
than 40 different genes, termed PhoP-activated (pag) and PhoP-repressed (prg) genes.

ment of amino acid 48 of PhoQ with isoleucine, locks S. typhimurium in a state of
pag activation and prg repression termed the
PhoP-constitutive phenotype (PhoPc) (4,
5). Deletion of phoP or phoQ results in a
PhoP null phenotype (PhoP–) (2, 3). Both
PhoPc and PhoP– bacteria show decreased
virulence, which indicates that the ability
to sense various mammalian microenvironments and alter gene transcription is essential for pathogenesis (2–5). PhoP-PhoQ induces transcription of genes essential to virulence in mice, bacterial survival within
macrophages, and resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides (2, 3, 6, 7) and represses genes essential for induction of macropinocytosis in macrophages and epithelial
cells (2, 3). Genes in the pag group are
transcriptionally activated within acidified
macrophage phagosomes after S. typhimurium phagocytosis by cultured macrophages and after infection of mice as measured by in vivo expression technology
(IVET) (8, 9). Therefore, PhoPc bacteria

simulate in part the regulation state of bacteria within host tissues and macrophage
phagosomes.
LPS is a pathogenic factor of Gramnegative bacteria that consists of three distinct structural regions: O-antigen, core,
and lipid A. Both O-antigen and core consist of polysaccharide chains, whereas lipid
A is formed primarily of fatty acid and
phosphate substituents bonded to a central
glucosamine dimer. Lipid A is the major
signaling component of LPS that stimulates
cytokine release in the host (10).
To investigate whether the PhoP-PhoQ
system regulated alteration of lipid A structure, we conducted experiments with lipid
A and LPS from various S. typhimurium
strains (11). The fatty acid content of LPS
and whole bacteria were studied by gas
chromatography (GC) and GC–mass spectrometry (MS). Comparison of the molar
ratios of C12:0 versus C14:0 fatty acids
(Table 1) showed that the wild-type and
PhoP– strains gave a 1:1 ratio, whereas the
PhoPc strain gave a 2 :1 ratio. A previously
unreported component of S. typhimurium
LPS, 2-OH C14:0, was observed in the
PhoPc strain in an amount that would
make up for the loss of C14:0 (Table 1).
Fatty acid profiles from whole bacteria
showed that the PhoPc strain contained
1.6 nmol of 2-OH C14:0 per milligram of
cell dry weight, and the molar ratio of
3-OH C14:0 to 2-OH C14:0 for PhoPc
LPS was similar to that of the whole cell.
2-OH C14:0 was not observed in the
whole cell of the wild-type and PhoP–
strains, which indicated that the presence
of 2-OH C14:0 in LPS from the PhoPc
strain was not an artifact of LPS isolation.
In addition, the total quantity of LPS fatty
acid (per milligram of dry weight) indicated that the LPS composition differed
among wild-type, PhoPc, and PhoP–
strains (Table 1), which implied that the
LPS in the PhoPc strain contained less
O-antigen polysaccharide relative to the
