Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Epigenetic markers such as DNA methylation and histone modifications around promoter regions
modify chromatin structure and regulate expression of downstream genes. In fact, aberrant
epigenetic modifications are common events in human disease including tumorigenesis and
autoimmunity. Small non-coding RNAs named microRNAs (miRNAs) are modulators of gene
expression and play critical roles in various cellular processes. Several miRNAs have been
characterized as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in cancer, and recent reports implicate certain
miRNAs in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Epigenetic investigations have shown that
distinct miRNAs are directly regulated by DNA methylation and histone modifications at their
promoters. Moreover, miRNAs themselves are key participants in regulating the chromatin
modifying machinery. Chromatin-modifying drugs such as DNA methylation inhibitors and
histone deacetylase inhibitors have shown efficacy in human malignancies and there is some
evidence that these drugs may be useful in autoimmune disease. The benefits of these drugs are at
least partially mediated by restoring expression of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes,
including miRNAs. The complex layers regulating gene expression have yet to be fully elucidated,
but it is clear that epigenetic alterations and miRNA misexpression are essential events in
pathologic processes, especially cancer and autoimmune disease, and represent promising
therapeutic targets.

DNA Methylation and Histone Modifications

Author Manuscript

Epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation and histone modification are critical in
chromatin remodeling and regulation of gene expression in mammalian development [1].
Aberrant DNA methylation is one of the most consistent epigenetic changes in human
cancers [2]. DNA methylation patterns are generated and heritably maintained by three
active DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. The de novo
methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B act independently of replication and show
equal preference for both unmethylated and hemimethylated DNA, whereas the maintenance
DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 acts during replication and preferentially methylates
hemimethylated DNA [3]. DNA hypermethylation refers principally to the gain of
methylation at specific sites that are unmethylated under normal conditions. This aberrant
methylation occurs mainly in short CpG-rich DNA stretches called CpG islands. DNA
methylation can lead to gene silencing by either preventing or promoting the recruitment of
regulatory proteins to DNA. It can provide binding sites for methyl-binding domain
proteins, which can mediate gene repression through interactions with histone deacetylases
(HDACs). This phenomenon of aberrant promoter CpG island hypermethylation is
associated with the stabilization of transcriptional repression and loss of gene function, and
often occurs in tumor suppressor genes. In contrast, DNA hypomethylation is associated
mainly with the loss of DNA methylation in genome-wide repeat regions. DNA
hypomethylation has been reported in several tumor types, such as colorectal and gastric
cancers, and occurs in many gene-poor genomic areas, including repetitive elements,
retrotransposons, and introns, where it leads to genomic instability [4].

The N-terminal tails of histones can undergo a variety of posttranslational modifications
including methylation and acetylation on specific residues. These histone modifications
regulate transcription of genes that play important roles in cellular processes. Unlike DNA
methylation, histone modifications can lead to either activation or repression depending
upon which residues are modified and the type of modifications present. For example, trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4) is enriched at transcriptionally active gene
promoters [5], whereas di-and tri-methylation of H3K9 and tri-methylation of H3K27 is
present at gene promoters that are transcriptionally repressed [6, 7]. As shown in Fig. 1,
transcriptionally active chromatin in normal cells is characterized by acetylation of histone
H3 and tri-methylation of H3K4. Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes during
carcinogenesis is generally mediated by two distinct histone modifications: methylation of
H3K9 and tri-methylation of H3K27. The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)
mediates epigenetic gene silencing by tri-methylating H3K27. Methylation of H3K9 works
in concert with DNA methylation, whereas tri-methylation of H3K27 occurs independently
of DNA methylation [8]. HDAC induces deacetylation of histone H3 in both of these
pathways of epigenetic silencing.

Biogenesis of MicroRNA (miRNA)

miRNAs have been identified in the human genome, each of which potentially controls
hundreds of target genes and therefore play important roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis,
differentiation, and tumorigenesis [9, 10]. As shown in Fig. 2, miRNA genes are generally
transcribed from transcription start sites (TSSs) by RNA polymerase II (pol II) to form
primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). Pol II-transcribed pri-miRNAs are capped with 7methylguanosine and are polyadenylated. The nuclear RNase III enzyme Drosha and its cofactor DGCR8 process pri-miRNAs into ~60-nt precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), which
form an imperfect stem-loop structure. Pre-miRNAs are transported into the cytoplasm by
exportin 5 and are subsequently cleaved by Dicer into mature miRNAs, which are then
loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The miRNA/RISC complex
downregulates specific gene products by translational repression via binding to partially
complementary sequences in the 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the target mRNAs or by
directing mRNA degradation via binding to perfectly complementary sequences [11].

Epigenetic Regulation of miRNAs in Cancer

Author Manuscript

Because miRNAs can have large-scale effects through regulation of a variety of target
genes, understanding the regulatory mechanisms controlling miRNA expression is
important. Many miRNAs are expressed in a tissue and tumor-specific manner, implying
that some miRNAs are under epigenetic control. We reported that ~5 % of human miRNAs
are upregulated more than 3-fold by treatment of T24 bladder cancer cells with the DNA
demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) and the histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (PBA). In particular, miR-127, which is embedded
in a CpG island, was remarkably induced by a decrease in DNA methylation and an increase
in active histone marks around the promoter region of the miR-127 gene. In addition,
activation of miR-127 by epigenetic treatment resulted in the downregulation of its target
oncogene BCL6 [12]. We also demonstrated that treatment of gastric cancer cells with 5Aza-CdR and PBA induced activation of miR-512-5p which is located at Alu repeats on
chromosome 19. Activation of miR-512-5p by epigenetic treatment caused suppression of
MCL1, resulting in apoptosis of gastric cancer cells [13]. These results indicate that
chromatin remodeling by epigenetic treatment directly activates specific miRNA expression.

Lujambio et al. [14] compared miRNA expression profiling between the wild-type HCT116
colon cancer cell line and HCT116 after genetic disruption of both DNMT1 and DNMT3b
(DKO cells). They found that 18 out of 320 miRNAs are significantly upregulated in DKO
cells. In particular, miR-124a is silenced by its own CpG island hypermethylation in human
tumors, but can be activated by inhibition of DNA methylation. They also demonstrated that
the oncogene CDK6 is a target of miR-124a and that epigenetic silencing of miR-124a in
cancer cells modulates CDK6 activity. Brueckner et al. [15] showed that methylation of the
let-7a-3 gene, which is embedded in a CpG island, is cooperatively maintained by DNMT1
and DNMT3B. The let-7a-3 gene is heavily methylated in normal human tissues, but
hypomethylated in lung adenocarcinomas. DNA hypomethylation causes increased
expression of let-7a-3 leading to oncogenic changes. Recent studies have reported that
miR-9-1 and miR-9-3 are potential tumor suppressor miRNAs and are inactivated by
epigenetic mechanisms in human cancers [16, 17]. MiR-34a was identified as a target of p53
and induces cell cycle arrest, senescence and apoptosis [18, 19]. MiR-34a expression is

silenced in several types of cancer due to aberrant CpG methylation of its promoter. Reexpression of miR-34a induced senescence and cell cycle arrest in pancreatic cancer cells, at
least in part by targeting CDK6, indicating that miR-34a represents a tumor suppressor gene,
which is inactivated by CpG methylation in pancreatic cancer [20]. MiR-34b and miR-34c
are also silenced by aberrant CpG island methylation in colorectal cancer [21]. MiR-1
expression is markedly reduced by aberrant CpG island methylation in primary human
hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) compared with matching liver tissues. Reactivation of
miR-1 by the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC) with downregulation of its
target genes FoxP1, MET and HDAC4 suppressed proliferation of HCC cells [22]. As
summarized in Table 1, we and other groups have reported that specific miRNAs can be
directly regulated from their own promoters by epigenetic alterations induced by chromatin
modifying drugs or by genetic disruption of key DNMTs in cancer.

Some miRNAs reside within the intronic regions of either coding or non-coding
transcription units [23]. It is believed that intronic miRNAs are coordinately expressed with
their host gene mRNA [23]. Kim et al. [24] revealed the processing mechanism for intronic
miRNAs, in which intronic miRNAs are processed from unspliced intronic regions before
splicing catalysis, indicating that both intronic miRNAs and their host genes are generated
from a common transcript. This suggests the expression of intronic miRNAs depends on the
regulation of their host genes. We have found that the tumor suppressor miR-126, which is
located within an intron of the EGFL7gene, is downregulated in human cancer cell lines and
in primary bladder and prostate tumors. MiR-126 and one of the transcripts of EGFL7 that
has a CpG island promoter are concomitantly upregulated in cancer cell lines by inhibitors
of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation. These findings suggest that epigenetic
changes can control expression of tumor suppressor intronic miRNAs by directly controlling
their host genes [25]. MiR-342 is also located within an intron of the EVL gene, and is
silenced in colorectal cancer. The expression of miR-342 is coordinated with the expression
of EVL by CpG island methylation upstream of EVL. This supports a mechanism for
silencing intronic miRNAs in cancer by epigenetic alterations of cognate host genes [26].
These findings indicate that epigenetic treatment activates miRNA expression in two ways:
by directly activating miRNAs such as miR-127 from their own promoters and/or by
activating intronic miRNAs such as miR-126 together with their host genes (Fig. 3).

Chromatin-Modifying Factors Regulated by miRNAs in Cancer

Author Manuscript

Recent studies have reported that miRNAs directly regulate key chromatin-modifying
factors such as DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and EZH2, suggesting that these miRNAs
have important roles in the epigenetic control of gene expression (Table 2). MiR-152 is
downregulated in human cancers, including HCC and endometrial cancer, and targets
DNMT1[27, 28]. In fact, miR-152 may act as a tumor suppressor via suppression of DNMT1.
Fabbri et al. showed that the miR-29 family target DNMT3A and DNMT3B, and expression
levels of the miR-29 family were suppressed in lung cancer. The reduced expression of the
miR-29 family induced overexpression of DNMT3A and DNMT3B, resulting in aberrant
DNA methylation in lung cancer [29]. PRC1 and PRC2-mediated epigenetic regulation is
critical for maintaining homeostasis [30]. PRC2 mediates epigenetic gene silencing by
trimethylation of H3K27 and aberrantly silences tumor suppressor genes in cancer. EZH2,

the catalytic subunit of PRC2, enhances tumorigenesis and is commonly overexpressed in
several types of cancers. MiR-101 is downregulated in bladder cancer, and miR-101 directly
represses EZH2. This suggests that abnormal downregulation of miR-101 could lead to the
overexpression of EZH2 frequently seen in cancer. MiR-101 may be a potent tumor
suppressor by altering global chromatin structure through repression of EZH2 [31, 32]. Cao
et al. have identified several miRNAs such as miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-200b, miR-200c,
and miR-203 that are repressed by EZH2. These miRNAs, in turn, regulate the expression of
PRC1 proteins BMI1 and RING2, indicating a coordinate regulation of PRC1 and PRC2
activities that is mediated by miRNAs [33].

Epigenetics and Autoimmune Diseases

Author Manuscript

Autoimmune diseases are complex, display a spectrum of severity, and their etiology is
poorly understood. In addition, there are many different cell types that may participate in
autoimmune pathogenesis, which complicates the elucidation of distinct molecular
mechanisms for disease initiation and progression. Despite the difficulties in studying
autoimmune disease, reports have isolated distinct cell populations in specific diseases and
have shown clear molecular alterations that likely contribute to pathogenesis. Although there
is a genetic predisposition to developing autoimmune disease, the story does not stop there.
This is highlighted by the discordance in monozygotic twins for some autoimmune diseases
being as high as 85 % (in rheumatoid arthritis). Clearly, in many cases of aberrant
autoimmunity, sequence independent changes in gene regulation are most important [34].

Author Manuscript

The major pathologic phenomena of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are cartilage and bone
damage from synovial hyperplasia caused by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines
produced by activated B and T cells, amongst other cell types. Therefore, studies have
primarily focused on synovial fibroblasts (SF) and lymphocytes. RA synovial fibroblasts
(RASF) differ in both morphology and gene expression from their healthy tissue
counterparts. A role for DNA hypomethylation in the pathogenesis of RA was first
suggested by the aberrant expression of L1 elements in RA tissues. L1 are normally silenced
retrotransposoms, which were induced by treatment of normal SFs with 5-Aza-CdR [35].
Moreover, global hypomethylation was observed in RASF along with a decrease in
DNMT1, and normal fibroblasts treated with 5-AzaC acquired an activated phenotype [36].
There is also evidence of epigenetically upregulated markers of inflammation in RA.
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that correlates with RA disease activity,
and was hypomethylated with corresponding upregulated mRNA levels in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) from RA patients [37].

Author Manuscript

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease resulting from
widespread tissue damage caused by autoreactive T lymphocytes and the production of
autoantibodies. A decrease in enzymatic activity of DNMTs is associated with defective
DNA methylation and aberrant gene regulation in SLE. Specifically, T cells isolated from
SLE patients had decreased DNA methylation, and normal T cells treated with 5-AzaC
showed functional and phenotypic similarities to T cells from SLE patients [38–41]. In
addition, white blood cells from monozygotic twin SLE patients had marked DNA
hypomethylation when compared to their healthy siblings [42]. CD4+ T cell studies have

shown there is overexpression and hypomethylation of genes involved in signaling pathways
associated with cell-cell adhesion, T cell proliferation and clonal expansion, and B cell IgG
overproduction [43–46]. IL-6 is associated with SLE disease severity and a recent report
noted hypomethylation of an IL-6 promoter in SLE B cells [47]. The study also showed that
increased IL-6 in B cells decreased DNMT1 expression and led to impaired B cell receptor
signaling, which is relevant to SLE pathogenesis.

miRNA Misexpression in Autoimmune Diseases

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Several studies have shown that miRNAs are an integral part of regulating the immune
response and immune cell development [48]. Therefore, it was expected that miRNAs were
also involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Examining T cells from SLE
patients revealed several dysregulated miRNAs. MiR-21 and miR-148a were overexpressed
in CD4+ T cells from patients with SLE, which contribute to DNA hypomethylation by
repressing DNMT1 expression (Table 2). This in turn leads to the overexpression of
autoimmune-associated methylation-sensitive genes, such as CD70 and LFA-1, via promoter
demethylation. MiR-148a directly suppressed DNMT1 expression by targeting the protein
coding region of its transcript, whereas miR-21 indirectly downregulated DNMT1 expression
by targeting an important autoimmune gene, RASGRP1, which mediated the Ras-MAPK
pathway upstream of DNMT1 [49]. Another report has shown that miR-126 was upregulated
and suppressed DNMT1 as a direct target in SLE CD4+ T cells. Expression of the miR-126
host gene EGFL7 was also upregulated in CD4+ T cells from patients with SLE, possibly in
a hypomethylation-dependent manner (Tables 1 and 2). Thus, miR-126 regulates DNA
methylation in CD4+ T cells and contributes to Tcell autoreactivity in SLE by directly
targeting DNMT1 [50]. These findings demonstrated a critical functional link between
miRNAs and aberrant DNA hypomethylation in SLE CD4+ T cells. Inquiries into the
functional significance of miR-142-3p/5p downregulation in SLE CD4+ T cells showed it
directly suppressed members of the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM)
family, IL-10 and CD84, and SLAM-associated protein (SAP). Enforced expression of
miR-142-3p/5p in SLE CD4+ T cells restored IL-10, CD84, and SAP levels, and decreased
both T cell activity and IgG production, while inhibiting miR-142-3p/5p expression in
normal CD4+ T cells induced a SLE-like phenotype. Studies of PBMCs in SLE patients
revealed several miRNAs were misexpressed when compared to controls [51]. Specifically,
miR-146a, which was inhibited in SLE, targeted key signaling proteins in the interferon
pathway [52].

Author Manuscript

Expression levels of miR-34a* were found to be reduced in RASFs compared to SFs from
osteoarthritis (OA) patients, where levels of miR-34a, miR-34b/b*, and miR-34c/c* did not
differ. The promoter of miR-34a/34a* was methylated and transcription of the miR-34a
duplex was induced upon treatment with demethylating agents. Enforced expression of
miR-34a* led to an increased rate of FasL- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in RASFs.
Moreover miR-34a* directly suppressed X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP),
which was upregulated in RASF (Table 1). These findings suggest that a methylationspecific down-regulation of proapoptotic miR-34a* in RASFs results in up-regulation of its
direct target XIAP, thereby contributing to the resistance of RASFs to apoptosis [53].

Stanczyk et al. analyzed differential miRNA expression in RASFs treated with TNFα and
found that miR-146a and miR-155 were upregulated. Both of these miRNAs also had higher
levels of expression than in OASFs. Functional studies showed that miR-155 expression led
to repression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and -3 [54]. A subsequent report from
this group revealed that miR-203 was upregulated in RASFs when compared to OASFs or
healthy controls. Interestingly, miR-203 levels in normal SFs did not change with TNFα or
IL-1β treatment, but were increased by treatment with 5-azaC. Enforced miR-203 expression
increased levels of MMP-1 and IL-6, though the IL-6 induction was dependent on an intact
NF-κB pathway [55]. Studies using synovial tissue (not RASF) from RA patients showed
that miR-146 was upregulated when compared to OA patients, and miR-146 expression in
RASFs was induced by TNFα and IL-1β [56]. When PBMCs of RA patients were analyzed,
miR-146a, miR-155, miR-132, and miR-16 were overexpressed compared to controls,
showing similarities to the miRNA misexpression patterns seen in RASFs [57].

Author Manuscript

Altered miRNA expression has also been found in multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic,
inflammatory, autoimmune disease characterized by demyelination from myelin-specific
CD4+ T cells. Otaegui et al. found that miR-18b and miR-599 were associated with relapse,
while miR-96 was associated with remission and the interleukin and WNT pathways [58].
Interleukin 17 (IL-17)-producing T helper cells (T(H)-17 cells) play an important role in
autoimmune pathogenesis including MS. MiR-326, a T(H)-17 associated miRNA, levels
correlated with disease severity, and miR-326 promoted T(H)-17 differentiation by targeting
Ets-1, a negative regulator of T(H)-17 differentiation [59].

Perspectives
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

A promising option for cancer treatment is the use of epigenetic drugs which inhibit tumor
growth by several mechanisms including restoring the expression of epigenetically silenced
tumor suppressor genes and miRNAs [60]. Inhibitors of DNA methylation and histone
deacetylation can work synergistically to suppress growth of cancer cell lines both in vitro
and in vivo. This effect may be caused by inducing cancer cells to differentiate, reexpressing aberrantly silenced tumor suppressor genes, and re-expressing tumor antigens
which would aid immune surveillance [60]. Many epigenetic drugs have shown promising
results in clinical trials for cancer [61, 62]. Applying these epigenetic drugs to autoimmune
diseases such as SLE and RA, which show aberrant epigenetic alterations, may lead to
clinical benefits. In fact, a HDACi was used in a clinical trial for juvenile idiopathic arthritis
[63]. Another intriguing therapeutic avenue would enforce expression of multiple miRNAs
that may act synergistically for a specific disease [64, 65]. Taken together, alterations in
epigenetic marks and miRNAs are critical to the molecular mechanisms underlying
carcinogenesis and autoimmunity, and further elucidating the complex layers of regulation
may lead to novel treatments for these diseases.

Epigenetic gene silencing in cancer cells. Transcriptionally active chromatin in normal cells
is characterized by acetylation of histone H3 (Ac) and tri-methylation of H3K4 (K4Me).
Epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes during carcinogenesis is generally mediated
by two distinct histone modifications: methylation of H3K9 (K9Me) and trimethylation of
H3K27 (K27Me). PRC2 mediates epigenetic gene silencing by tri-methylating H3K27.
Methylation of H3K9 works in concert with DNA methylation induced by DNMTs, whereas
trimethylation of H3K27 works independent of DNA methylation. HDAC induces
deacetylation of histone H3 in the both pathways of epigenetic silencing. Open circle
unmethylated DNA; filled circle methylated DNA

Biogenesis of miRNA. MiRNA genes are transcribed from TSS by RNA pol II to form primiRNAs which are capped with 7-methylguanosine and polyadenylated (AAAAA). Drosha
and its co-factor DGCR8 process pri-miRNAs into pre-miRNAs. Pre-miRNAs are
transported into the cytoplasm and are subsequently cleaved by Dicer into mature miRNAs.
Mature miRNAs are then loaded into RISC, where miRNAs downregulate specific gene
products by translational repression via binding to partially complementary sequences in the
3′ UTR of the target mRNAs or by directing mRNA degradation via binding to perfectly
complementary sequences

Epigenetic activation of miRNAs. Epigenetic treatment activates miRNA expression in two
ways: by directly activating miRNAs such as miR-127from their own promoters (a) and by
activating intronic miRNAs such as miR-126 together with their host genes (b). Open circle
unmethylated CpG site, filled circle methylated CpG site
