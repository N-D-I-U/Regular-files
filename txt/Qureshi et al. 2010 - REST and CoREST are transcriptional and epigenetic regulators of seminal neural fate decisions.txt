Complementary transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory
factors (e.g., histone and chromatin modifying enzymes and
non-coding RNAs) regulate genes responsible for mediating
neural stem cell maintenance and lineage restriction, neuronal
and glial lineage specification and progressive stages of
lineage maturation. However, an overall understanding of
the mechanisms that sense and integrate developmental
signals at the genomic level and control cell type-specific gene
network deployment has not emerged. REST and CoREST are
central players in the transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory
circuitry that is responsible for modulating neural genes,
and they have been implicated in establishing cell identity
and function, both within the nervous system and beyond
it. Herein, we discuss the emerging context-specific roles of
REST and CoREST and highlight our recent studies aimed at
elucidating their neural developmental cell type- and stagespecific actions. These observations support the conclusion
that REST and CoREST act as master regulators of key neural
cell fate decisions.

base pair repressor element 1/neuron restrictive silencer element
(RE1/NRSE) cis-regulatory DNA sequence. These RE1 motifassociated genes included many neuron-specific genes, such as
those encoding ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, and
neurosecretory factors.3 Outside of the nervous system, REST
expression was detected ubiquitously in mouse embryos.1 Within
the developing nervous system, REST was detected in neural
progenitor cells but not in mature neurons.2 These initial observations seemed to suggest that REST acts as a repressor of RE1
motif-associated neuronal gene expression in non-neural, neural
stem/progenitor and non-neuronal cells and further that it serves
as a master regulator of neurogenesis.
Our knowledge of REST and its actions has expanded significantly since its discovery. We now recognize that the complex
biology of REST includes the potential for it to interact directly
or indirectly with a broad and increasing array of transcriptional
and epigenetic regulatory cofactors (including CoREST4), to be
alternatively spliced and differentially transported between the
nucleus and cytoplasm,5 to promote gene activation in addition
to repression and long-term gene silencing,6,7 to modify the epigenetic status of target gene loci distinct from effects on transcription,8,9 to modulate genes not associated with the canonical
RE1 motif,10 and to exhibit high levels of integration with noncoding RNA networks that, among other things, mediate cell
identity.11 This remarkable flexibility in all aspects of REST
regulation is consistent with our emerging appreciation for
the decidedly context-specific effects of REST for establishing
and maintaining cell identity and function. Indeed, REST and
CoREST seem to play important roles in a growing number of
normal and pathological cell types, including embryonic stem
cells (ESCs)12-18 and cancer19-28 cells. In this review, we focus on
understanding the evolving roles of REST and CoREST in transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of seminal neural cell fate
decisions.

Neural Developmental Processes
Including Neural Cell Fate Determination
Neural stem cells (NSCs) and their progeny have been the focus
of numerous studies aimed at characterizing the molecular
mechanisms that orchestrate self-renewal, proliferation, lineage
restriction, neuronal and glial lineage specification, progressive
maturation and terminal differentiation. Included in these investigations is a quest to determine the regulatory logic for promoting the elaboration of diverse regional neuronal as well as glial
cell subtypes and for mediating the complementary processes
of progressive oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage maturation and
myelination, neuronal-glial interactions and neural connectivity.
These studies have begun to define the temporal and spatial profiles of gradient morphogens, cytokines, growth factors, cell-cell
signaling cues and combinatorial transcription factor codes that
establish neural cell identity and control the elaboration of both
neuronal and glial lineages from distinct regional NSC subpopulations contained within the neuraxis.29,30 Gradient morphogens,
such as sonic hedgehog (SHH) and bone morphogenetic proteins
(BMPs), induce patterning genes in specific areas of the developing neural tube. In ventral domains, SHH establishes a characteristic profile of homeodomain (HD) and basic helix-loop-helix
(HLH) transcription factor expression, whereas BMPs mediate
a complementary developmental program in the dorsal aspect
of the neural tube. Rostrocaudal patterning occurs in a similar
manner. Noggin, chordin and follistatin act as inductive signals
for forebrain, whereas fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and retinoic acid (RA) represent inductive signals for hindbrain regions.
These patterning and lineage specific genes establish discrete progenitor domains through cross-repressive interactions that define
the identities of individual neural progenitor species and promote
the subsequent elaboration of specific neuronal and glial subtypes.
These developmental cues, such as Notch signaling, promote the
sequential expression of transcription factor codes that coordinate progressive stages of neuronal and glial lineage elaboration.
These combinatorial transcription factor codes include inhibitory
HLH transcriptional regulators (Hes/Hey and Id), which interact with other basic HLH and HD genes.31 Dynamic changes
in the deployment and redeployment of different combinations
and permutations of transcription factors mediate downstream
developmental programs, including terminal differentiation and
neural network integration.32
More recently, epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as an
novel molecular interface for integrating cues from these diverse
cell intrinsic, cell-cell associated and environmental signaling
pathways and, in turn, for regulating the deployment of specific
gene networks that determine neural cell identity. These developmental processes may be mediated through context-dependent
gene activation, repression, long-term silencing, graded and
coordinate gene expression, establishment of epigenetic memory
states and dynamic changes in nuclear architecture. Indeed, an
increasing number of studies have begun to uncover how epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications
and chromatin remodeling and short and long non-coding RNAs
(ncRNA) regulation, are responsible for promoting neural cell

4478

type- and developmental stage-specific gene expression profiles
and thus, for mediating seminal neural cell fate decisions.33-35
How transcriptional and epigenetic processes, including those
mediated by REST and CoREST, promote key neural developmental events has been the focus of intensive investigations.
REST and CoREST in Developmental Processes
Studies examining the expression, regulation and function of
REST suggest a spectrum of developmental roles. In fact, the
phenotype exhibited by REST knockout mice clearly establishes
that REST is required for embryogenesis, although an integrated
understanding of its actions during this process is still emerging.
REST knockout animals display malformations in non-neural
and neural tissues with lethality at embryonic day 11.5 associated
with complex profiles of neural gene deregulation. These wideranging abnormalities are potentially explained by the fact that
REST is implicated in a range of development processes, from
patterning of ectoderm36 to neuronal maturation (i.e., axon pathfinding).37 In addition, REST is modulated by multiple developmental cues, including patterning and specification factors (e.g.,
RA, BMP and WNT).38,39 These observations imply that REST
acts as a regulator of multiple stages of embryonic and neural
development through precise regulation of neural developmental
genes.
Less is known about the developmental functions of CoREST
than those of REST. However, there is evidence to suggest that
CoREST has not only cooperative but also distinct roles in mediating neural cell identity. For example, CoREST expression is
highly developmentally regulated, found more selectively in the
embryonic nervous system compared to REST and downregulated at the time of birth.40-43 Further, CoREST is more evolutionarily conserved than REST.41 These observations suggest that
CoREST may have more primordial functions in neural gene
regulation.
REST and CoREST as Highly Flexible Transcriptional
and Epigenetic Regulatory Factors
REST acts as a modular scaffold for the recruitment of a diverse
array of transcriptional and epigenetic factors and macromolecular complexes to specific genomic loci. CoREST binds to the
C-terminal domain of REST.4 In turn, CoREST recruits histone deacetylases, HDAC1 and HDAC2; methyl-CpG binding
protein 2, MECP2; histone demethylase, LSD1; histone methyltransferases, G9a and Suv39 h1; zinc finger proteins, ZNF198
and ZNF217; the acetyltransferase, Esco2; and components of
the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, BAF57, BRG1
and BAF170. Similarly, mSin3 binds to the N-terminal domain
of REST and also recruits histone deacetylases, HDAC1 and
HDAC2. Furthermore, it is increasingly being recognized that
REST and/or CoREST have the potential to interact with a large
array of additional and complementary regulatory factors. These
include DNA methyltransferases; additional methyl-CpG binding domain proteins; chromatin remodeling enzymes, such as the
histone demethylase, SMCX; the chromodomain Y chromosome

family member, CDYL;20 the NADH-binding factor, CtBP; 44 the
small C-terminal domain phosphatase, Scp1; 45 and the transcription factor, Sp3.46 The identification of an increasing number of
potential interactors reveals a complex and flexible functional
repertoire of transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms well
beyond those initially envisioned for REST and CoREST.
REST also associates with Mediator, a large evolutionarily
conserved complex that is essential for mediating RNA polymerase II activity.47,48 The Mediator complex is comprised of
multiple (~26) subunits with general and specific roles in gene
regulation, including activation and repression. The mechanisms
by which Mediator affects transcription are still being characterized but include control of both pre- and post-initiation events.
Interestingly, recent studies have shown that Mediator promotes
DNA looping between gene enhancers and promoters, in concert
with cohesin.49 The profiles of Mediator and cohesin occupancy
can vary by cell type, suggesting context-specific developmental
roles. The core Mediator subunits, Med19 and Med26, interact
with REST directly and synergistically, promoting the recruitment of the entire Mediator complex to genomic RE1 sites occupied by REST.47 In turn, the Mediator complex facilitates the
recruitment of G9a to these sites, through interactions between
its Med12 subunit and G9a.50 Notably, Med12 expression is
enriched in the nervous system, where it plays a role in regulating neuronal development. In zebrafish, Med12 mutants exhibit
deficits of monoaminergic neurons and cranial sensory ganglia
through deregulation of key neural developmental genes.51 In
mouse, mosaic expression of Med12 leads to all known neural
tube defects.52 In humans, Med12 missense mutations cause the
X-linked mental retardation disorders, FG syndrome and Lujan
syndrome, by disturbing its functional interactions with REST.50
REST and CoREST complexes can independently or coordinately regulate certain gene loci. For example, some authors have
designated neuronal genes regulated by these factors as Class I or
Class II, depending on whether CoREST binds independently
to the gene promoter.53 Only the REST complex binds to Class I
gene promoters. In contrast, distinct REST and CoREST complexes bind to Class II gene promoters but at different sites. Thus,
levels of Class I gene expression are highest when REST is absent.
However, levels of activity-dependent Class II gene expression
are only sub-maximal when REST is absent because of repressive
effects from a distinct CoREST complex bound to the promoters of these genes at different sites. Although these functional
classifications are important, our understanding of genome-wide
REST and CoREST binding profiles and their site-specific and
potentially more long range effects on transcriptional and epigenetic regulation have evolved since the initial description of these
two classes.
The REST gene can be spliced into at least five distinct isoforms that may be differentially expressed, regulated, degraded
and functionally deployed.5,54-57 Each of these isoforms may have
distinct affinities for RE1 motifs. They may have individual
profiles of nuclear and cytoplasmic localization, distinct modular partners and differential effects on gene regulation. Further,
the stoichiometry of different REST isoforms may impact its
regulatory activities. For example, when REST4, a C-terminus

www.landesbioscience.com

truncated isoform, is co-expressed with other REST isoforms,
it acts in a dominant-negative fashion, competitively inhibiting
REST-induced gene silencing and promoting gene activation.54
The REST complex can function as a transcriptional repressor
or activator. A small modulatory ncRNA has been identified that
interacts directly with the REST complex and alters its behavior. This double-stranded ncRNA encodes the RE1 sequence
(dsNRSE) and is responsible for promoting RE1-associated gene
transcription.6,7 Furthermore, the presence of the dsNRSE in
certain populations of NSCs leads to their differentiation into
neuronal cells.6,7
REST and CoREST can also induce local and more longrange chromatin remodeling, distinct from their effects on transcription. For example, we recently showed that the binding of
REST to RE1 sites results in dramatic changes in nucleosome
phasing and in histone modifications.8 These included, but were
not limited to, significant reductions in profiles of histone acetylation and context-specific increases and decreases in profiles of
histone methylation. Interestingly, these REST-mediated chromatin-remodeling events were not restricted to gene promoter
regions. This finding may be consistent with previous studies
suggesting that REST and CoREST promote chromatin remodeling across extended chromosomal intervals.9
Recent studies have extended our understanding of the REST
regulome by utilizing complementary genome-wide approaches
to better characterize REST binding sites in the genome.10,15,58
These analyses have identified genomic binding sites for REST
associated with canonical RE1 (cRE1) motifs and non-canonical RE1 (ncRE1) motifs. The cRE1 motif is comprised of two
sequences that are each ten base pairs (bps) long separated by
a single non-conserved nucleotide. By contrast, ncRE1 motifs
are of variable length. These ncRE1 motifs are comprised of
two segments ten bps long separated by a variable insertion that
can be up to nine bps.10,59 These ncRE1 motif-associated genes
include many genes that are neuronal but also those that are
not. Intriguingly, it has been shown that the interaction between
REST and cRE1 motifs is strong, whereas its interaction with
other motifs is less robust, suggesting cell- or tissue-specific functions for REST in regulating these genes.60 The differential functional outcomes of REST binding to genes associated with these
different binding motifs have yet to be elucidated fully.
The functions of REST and CoREST are intimately linked
with those of at least two classes of ncRNAsâmicroRNAs
(miRNAs) and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs).11 miRNAs are relatively well characterized ~22 nucleotide ncRNA transcripts that
participate in post-transcriptional regulation of genes and gene
networks, through different degrees of sequence-specific interactions with cognate mRNAs resulting in translational repression
or sequestration of these transcripts. By contrast, lncRNAs are an
emerging class of ncRNAs defined as transcripts longer than 200
nucleotides. These diverse lncRNAs have a broad range of functions including the ability to modulate transcription, post-transcriptional RNA processing, translation, DNA methylation and
chromatin architecture through local and long-distance effects.61
Not surprisingly, both of these classes of ncRNAs are implicated
in mediating neural cell identity and function.34,35

A number of miRNAs enriched in the nervous system are
associated with RE1 motifs and are regulated by REST.62
Moreover, REST may regulate genes that play roles in miRNA
biogenesis including Dicer1, which is associated with an RE1
motif. These observations imply that REST can modulate the
expression of miRNAs at multiple levels in their life cycles. These
regulatory relationships may be bidirectional. In fact, there are
double negative feedback loops between members of the REST
complex and the miRNAs they regulate, such as miR-124, miR-9
and miR-132.62,63 Interestingly, miR-9/miR-9* is a bifunctional
miRNA that targets REST (miR-9) and CoREST (miR-9*).63
Furthermore, many REST-regulated miRNAs are also subject
to modulation by the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), another factor with key roles in mediating brain
development and adult neurogenesis.62 Indeed, an increasing
number of studies has highlighted the complex circuitry involving REST, CoREST, CREB and miRNAs that controls NSC
self-renewal, maintenance and differentiation.19,64,65 In addition,
a computational analysis comparing the distributions of RE1
motifs and of annotated lncRNA genes in mouse and human
genomes suggested that REST also has the potential to regulate 23% of annotated lncRNAs.66 In vitro studies performed
utilizing mouse and human tissues validated this hypothesis by
showing that REST influenced the expression of various developmentally expressed and nervous system restricted lncRNAs. For
example, AK090153 is a REST-regulated lncRNA with enriched
expression in the adult mouse pallidum (www.brain-map.org/
search.do?queryText=geneid = 143712, Allen Brain AtlasâAllen
Institute for Brain Science, Seattle). Intriguingly, one of the
critical functions of lncRNAs is to recruit REST and CoREST
complexes to specific genomic sites.67,68 We previously reported
utilizing in situ hybridization data from the Allen Brain Atlas to
identify region-, cell type- or subcellular compartment-specific
expression profiles for hundreds of lncRNAs in the adult mouse
brain.69 Other groups have identified complementary profiles of
lncRNA expression during brain development.70 Together, these
observations highlight the complex patterns of neural lncRNA
expression present during development and adult life and support the interesting possibility that REST and CoREST act more
globally as regulators of lncRNA expression. In turn, REST and
CoREST transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory functions
may be orchestrated by these lncRNAs.
Evolving Roles of REST and CoREST
in Seminal Neural Cell Fate Decisions
Previous efforts have focused on understanding the role played
by REST in regulating cell fate decisions. These have included
analyses of REST genome-wide binding profiles in various cell
lines.10,15,58 By contrast, we recently examined neural cell typeand developmental stage-specific profiles for REST and CoREST
promoter occupancy employing paradigms to generate neuronal
and glial subtypes and progressive stages of OL lineage maturation
including myelination from mouse forebrain-derived neural stem
and progenitor species.71-73 These studies are the first to report
such comprehensive and comparative genome-wide binding

4480

profiles for REST and for CoREST in primary neural cell types,
ranging from immature to mature neural lineage species. We
found thousands of occupied genomic loci including those associated with cRE1 and ncRE motifs as well as non-RE1 sites not
previously identified as targets for REST and CoREST regulation. We identified both unique and overlapping profiles for gene
promoters occupied by REST or CoREST across these cell types.
Moreover, we performed complementary gene expression analyses
within this neural developmental paradigm. Our data is the first
to correlate dynamic profiles of REST and CoREST promoter
occupancy with gene expression changes during neural lineage
elaboration. We found that REST or CoREST promoter binding
was not simply associated with gene downregulation. Rather, we
observed that transcriptional activation and repression and the
absence of significant shifts in profiles of transcription were all
possible outcomes of changes in REST and CoREST occupancy,
highlighting the complex, dynamic and flexible actions of REST
and CoREST (see above) in neural development functions. Our
overall observations suggest that REST and CoREST have the
potential to independently and coordinately regulate a very broad
range of genes and functional gene networks in an exquisitely
context-specific manner, through a spectrum of transcriptional
and epigenetic mechanisms (Fig. 1).
Examining the functions of these genes leads to the conclusion that REST and CoREST modulate diverse signaling
pathways, transcription factor codes, epigenetic networks and
associated developmental programs, all of which are at the nexus
of mediating neural cell identity and function.71-73 For example,
we observed that REST and CoREST target members of the
SHH gradient morphogen neurodevelopmental signaling pathway. These results are consistent with recent experimental work
in zebrafish, which demonstrated that REST modulates SHH
signaling.74 This study found that knocking down REST both
promotes and inhibits SHH signaling, depending on the developmental context.74 This observation once again highlights the
exquisite versatility of REST developmental functions.
We found that REST and CoREST target a large number
epigenetic factors in a cell type- and developmental stage-specific
manner, including but not limited to those that mediate DNA
methylation, histone modification, nucleosome repositioning
and higher order chromatin remodeling.71-73 These observations
are consistent with and significantly expand on previous findings
that have implicated REST in regulating chromatin modulatory
factors.10 Many of the epigenetic factors targeted by REST or
CoREST individually or in concert help to shape cell fate and
produce cellular diversity (see below). For example, REST and
CoREST target components of the cohesin complex, suggesting
roles in integrating neural enhancer and promoter functions and
more precisely regulating the differential deployment of developmental genes (see above).49 Intriguingly, many of these factors
are directly recruited by REST and CoREST complexes or indirectly participate in their functions. These observations suggest
that REST and CoREST determine cell fate through multiple
distinct mechanisms, which include modulation of epigenetic
factors at the transcriptional level and operationally through
recruitment to their macromolecular complexes.

Cell Cycle	Volume 9 Issue 22

Figure 1. This schematic illustrates the mechanisms by which REST and CoREST are responsible for the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of
developmental gene networks underpinning neural cell fate decisions.

We also found REST and CoREST targets that are involved in
the regulation of REST and CoREST transcription, post-translational modifications and profiles of cellular degradation.71-73 For
example, both REST and CoREST bind to the RE1-containing
REST promoter in NSCs. In addition, NCoR2 and RARÎ³ regulate transcription of REST, whereas the ubiquitin-proteosome
pathway degrades REST and sumoylation inactivates CoREST.
Autoregulation utilizing these flexible feed-forward and negative
feedback loops may confer significant sensitivity and responsivity
to REST and CoREST regulatory control systems, which seem
to be differentially exploited throughout NSC-mediated lineage
elaboration.
In addition, we found that genes targeted in a developmental stage- and cell type-specific manner encode factors that have
roles in cell surface identity and connectivity, homeostasis, stress
responses, as well as many additional cellular functions.71-73 These
observations suggest that these genes may have selective roles in
promoting a particular neural cell identity and/or repressing
alternate lineage fates.
Embryonic and neural stem cell maintenance and maturation. REST is implicated in mediating cell identity and function within a variety of cell types, including ESCs and NSCs.
It has been reported that REST is highly expressed in blastocysts and ESCs and that REST promotes the early stages of ESC
differentiation by suppressing the expression of pluripotency

www.landesbioscience.com

associated genes, such as Nanog.18 Moreover, it has been suggested that REST is even required for ESC pluripotency, however, this role for REST is controversial.75 Nonetheless, REST
transcriptional circuitry is highly integrated with that of pluripotency gene networks.17,76,77 For example, REST is a target of
the core pluripotency genes, and it may also regulate them. One
of the mechanisms by which REST is implicated in regulating
pluripotency gene networks is through effects on miRNAs (i.e.,
miR-21).17 Indeed, both miRNAs78 and lncRNAs79,80 have roles
in ESC pluripotency and differentiation. However, the potential
interrelationships between these factors and REST in ESCs have
yet to be defined fully.
The role of REST has been examined in the developmental
transition from ESCs into NSCs. REST is thought, at least in
part, to selectively silence a cohort of neuronal genes in ESCs.14
REST expression decreases with neural lineage commitment.53
Two complementary studies have shown differential REST
occupancy profiles in ESCs and NSCs and these findings suggested the presence of distinct and overlapping developmental
REST regulons.15,81 For example, one of these studies found 810
and 679 RE1 sites occupied by REST, respectively, in ESCs
and NSCs.15 These included only 32 unique sites in NSCs. This
study also suggested that REST promotes ESC-mediated neural lineage restriction by repressing a subset of neuronal differentiation genes (i.e., Scg3, Stmn3, Celsr3, Syp, Cplx1 and Syt4)

but not those with roles in neural lineage specification (i.e.,
Mash1 and Math1), implying preferential REST regulation
of neuronal terminal differentiation as compared with earlier
stages of lineage specification.14,81 A different study found that
REST depletion to 1% of wild type levels prevented the formation of NSCs and neurogenesis.82 Further, these deficits could
be rescued, in part, by the extracellular matrix component, laminin, which is a target of REST regulation. These observations
suggest that REST orchestrates neural cell fate decisions at various cellular stages through multiple interrelated molecular and
cellular mechanisms.
Intriguingly, in our NSC studies, we found that REST binds
to 322 promoter sites, including those containing RE1 and nonRE1 sequences.71 Differences in the number of REST targets compared with previous studies may be explained by the utilization of
distinct cell typesâmore biological representative primary NSCs
as compared to NSC cell lines15 and by a wide variety of methodological considerations related to their isolation, propagation and
interrogation. We unexpectedly found that CoREST binds to a
significantly greater number of genomic sites (1,820) compared
to REST and encompassing a larger proportion of unique target
genes in NSCs.71 These included many loci encoding factors that
are part of pluripotency networks83 and individual and composite
Oct4/Sox2/Nanog transcriptional networks; 84 those with critical roles in NSC maintenance, lineage restriction and neurogenesis; those involved in epigenetic regulatory networks, including
genes targeted by brain-related miRNAs (e.g., miR-124a, miR-9
and miR-132); and those linked to specific disease states associated with deregulation of NSC functions (i.e., cancer stem cells),
including glioblastoma multiforme. By contrast, we found that
both REST and CoREST target genes included factors implicated in Huntingtonâs disease, a disorder linked to deregulation
of REST subcellular localization and function.85 These observations suggest that CoREST may preferentially promote NSC
maintenance and fate restriction compared to REST and that
specific core pluripotency genes may have distinct and previously
unanticipated roles in early neural development.86
Further, we performed REST and CoREST knockdown
experiments utilizing NSC clonal expansion and differentiation assays to examine their roles in mediating neural cell fate
decisions. These studies revealed that REST ablation impedes
neurogenesis, consistent with previous studies,53,82 whereas
CoREST ablation significantly impedes NSC maintenance
and altered neural fate restriction, consistent with distinct roles
for CoREST in multi-lineage potential and early neural fate
decisions.71 Moreover, our studies revealed that both REST
and CoREST participate in the process of self-renewal, possibly in a cooperative manner, as revealed by our clonal gene
ablation studies and corresponding analysis of downstream
REST and CoREST gene targets.71 Further supporting this
model, we found that the ncRE1-associated Nr2e1 (Tlx) gene is
targeted by CoREST but not REST in NSCs. Nr2e1 interacts
directly with the histone demethylase, LSD1, a member of the
CoREST complex.87 It promotes NSC maintenance, including
self-renewal.88 Nr2e1 also participates in a dual negative transcriptional feedback loop with the microRNA, miR-9,89 which

4482

also has bidirectional transcriptional regulatory relationships
with REST and CoREST.62,63
REST and CoREST may also interact with other key factors involved in NSC fate decisions, such as the Polycomb group
(PcG) proteins, Bmi1 and Ezh2, which are both implicated in
regulating NSC maintenance and self-renewal.90,91 It has been
hypothesized that PcG complexes that contain these factors (i.e.,
PRC1 and PRC2) may be recruited to their genomic sites of
action by REST.8,92,93 However, an alternative explanation may
be that these PcG proteins and REST can both be co-recruited to
these genomic sites by lncRNAs.67
Neuronal subtype specification and maturation. We performed the first study of REST and CoREST occupancy profiles
across multiple neuronal subtypes and uncovered large networks
of neuronal subtype-specific target genes.72 Intriguingly, only a
minority of these gene targets is RE1 motif-associated. Further,
REST and CoREST targeted groups of genes that are largely
non-overlapping and also distinct within each neuronal subtype.
These findings strongly suggest that REST and CoREST do not
execute âgenericâ neuronal transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory programs but rather are involved in sculpting profiles of
genes expression involved in terminal neuronal differentiation
and regional neuronal subtype identity, maintenance and function, with important implications for our understanding of the
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.85,94
In fact, REST and CoREST each targeted only one site across
all four neuronal subtypes that we examined. REST only targeted Ehmt1, a H3K9 methyltransferase closely related to G9a
(Ehmt2), that is thought to play a role in regulating p53,95 and
lineage-specific genes in neurons.96 Ehmt1 is linked to various
cognitive and behavioral processes in animal models96 and associated with the development of intellectual and developmental
disabilities97,98 and medulloblastoma99 in humans. CoREST only
targeted Defb42, a G9a-regulated member of the Ã-defensin family of pleiotropic factors.100 REST recruits G9a to its macromolecular complex, suggesting that the association of both of these
factors with G9a is not coincidental but rather that it has a functional and regulatory impact on neurogenesis.
More generally within these neuronal subtypes, we found that
REST and CoREST targeted genes encoding members of key
neural developmental signaling pathways (e.g., FGF, RA, EGF,
Notch, BMP, SHH and WNT) and factors with roles in promoting neuronal subtype identity. For example, we identified many
target genes that are protocadherins. These factors are thought
to promote neuronal functional diversity and connectivity. We
observed that REST and CoREST targets included Pcdh15,

with a recent functional analysis showing that REST regulates
protocadherin genes, including genes that are not associated with
an RE1 motif.101
Our distinct REST and CoREST target gene profiles in neuronal subtypes also included factors not previously associated with
the establishment of neuronal subtype identity, such as particular
epigenetic factors (e.g., Mbd6, Smcx, Jarid1d, Lsd1 and Smarce1),

cell cycle regulators (e.g., Anapc10, Cdkal1, Cdc2l1, Cdkl4
and Mad2l1) and homeostatic modulators (e.g., Arih1, Mib1,
Ubb, Ube2j1 and Ubtd1). Furthermore, we found that REST
and CoREST also targeted genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases characterized by neuronal subtype-specific profiles of cell loss. These include genes linked to Alzheimerâs and
Parkinsonâs diseases, spinocerebellar ataxias, frontotemporal
dementia, myoclonic and dopa-responsive dystonias, pantothenate kinase associated neurodegeneration and hemochromatosis,
suggesting additional roles of REST and CoREST in mediating
the integrity of neuronal subtypes.
In a complementary analysis of neuronal subtype specification, we found differential expression of lncRNAs that may
also be targets of REST regulation.102 One of these, AK044422,
is a transcript previously implicated in the development of retinal cell types.103 This transcript overlaps a REST regulated
miRNA, miR-124a, but is polyadenylated, spliced and likely
to also function independently. It is therefore interesting to
speculate that REST modulates the expression not only of
miR-124a but also of AK044422.64 Mechanistically, miR-124
induces brain-specific alternative splicing by reducing levels
of the Ptbp1 splicing regulatory factor and thereby promotes
neuronal differentiation.104 An ncRE1 motif is associated with
Ptbp1 and with other splicing factors (e.g., Nova2) implying
that REST and CoREST may be involved in regulating neurogenesis through effects on alternative splicing. Ptbp1 and
AK044422 exhibit complementary expression profiles, suggesting that they may represent components of an integrated
AK044422/miR-124/Ptbp1 REST/CoREST-associated developmental gene regulatory network. These observations highlight the complex and integrated nature of REST, CoREST
and ncRNA circuitry responsible for the establishment of neuronal cell identity and developmental functions.11,105
Glial subtype specification and progressive stages of oligodendrocyte lineage maturation. We performed the first study
of REST and CoREST in developmental glial cell types and
uncovered a large network of glial-selective target genes.73 As in
neuronal subtypes, only a minority of these gene targets is RE1
motif-associated. Intriguingly, we identified a much larger cohort
of OL developmental stage-selective CoREST as compared to
REST target genes in OL precursor cells, which further implies
that CoREST plays an important, preferential and previously
unappreciated role in uncommitted immature neural cell types.
We also found that progressive stages of OL lineage maturation
are characterized by increasing numbers of target genes that are
common to REST and CoREST and shared between these OL
developmental cellular species. These observations imply that,
unlike neuronal subtype specification, which seems to employ
largely non-overlapping REST and CoREST regulatory modules, OL lineage progression seems to utilize coordinated REST
and CoREST regulatory modules. Moreover, profiles of REST
and CoREST target genes in NSCs, neuronal subtypes and glial
lineage species were largely non-overlapping, highlighting the
highly developmental context-dependent nature of REST and
CoREST genomic binding profiles. These observations imply
that largely independent REST and CoREST gene regulatory

networks dynamically sculpt diverse neural fate decisions by
integrating multiple layers of cell autonomous, cell-cell associated and environmental cues.
In fact, we found that REST and CoREST targeted genes
encoding factors involved in mediating glial cell identity and
function. These included members of key developmental pathways that regulate OL specification and progressive maturation
(e.g., PDGF, SHH, MAPK and FGF) and transcription factors
responsible for governing OL lineage specification, proliferation
and terminal differentiation including myelination, such as members of the HLH (e.g., E2A, HEB, Mash1, Olig2 and Id4), Hox
(e.g., Hoxa2), POU (e.g., Brn2), Sox (e.g., Sox4, Sox8 and Sox11),
Nkx (e.g., Nkx6.1) and zinc finger (e.g., Myt1 and Zfp488) transcription factor families.
Intriguingly, in astroglial cells, we identified a larger number
of distinct REST target genes compared to CoREST target genes,
suggesting a preferential role for REST in promoting astroglial
cell identity. Our observations are consistent with a subsequent
study demonstrating that BMP signaling upregulates REST
expression which, in turn, promotes astroglial lineage specification and maintenance.39
We also identified other REST and CoREST target genes
responsible for mediating a broad array of biological processes
that may be involved in determining glial cell identity and
function. These included numerous epigenetic (e.g., Hist1 h4a,
Mbd6, Scmh1, Smarca2 and Smc4l1) and cell cycle regulatory
(e.g., Ccna2, Ccnd1, Cdc34, Cdk5r1 and Cdkn2c) genes as well
as many classes of cell surface identity (e.g., protocadherin, olfactory receptors, vomeronasal receptors and cell adhesion and additional transmembrane proteins) factors. Furthermore, REST and
CoREST also targeted genes associated with oligodendrogliopathies, including multiple sclerosis and multisystem atrophy, suggesting previously unanticipated roles for REST and CoREST in
the pathogenesis of glial disease states.
Intriguingly, in a complementary study, we also identified
a number of developmentally regulated lncRNAs transcribed
from genomic loci encompassing protein-coding genes important for OL lineage elaboration, in antisense, bidirectional or
intronic configurations relative to these genes.102 For example,
Sox8OT is a bidirectional lncRNA differentially expressed during OL lineage maturation that is associated with Sox8, a RE1associated gene that plays key roles in OL differentiation. We
found that REST and CoREST targeted the Sox8 promoter in
post-mitotic and myelinating OLs, raising the intriguing possibility that REST and CoREST may coordinately regulate the
bidirectional transcripts, Sox8 and Sox8OT. In addition, REST
may also regulate miRNAs that are important for OL lineage
elaboration. For example, the miR-9 is downregulated during
OL differentiation.106 In addition, miR-9/9* has a bidirectional
regulatory relationship with REST and CoREST, 63 highlighting the complex gene regulatory relationships that may
underpin OL lineage elaboration. These overall observations
highlight the potential importance of REST and CoREST in
mediating the dynamic transcriptional and epigenetic modulation of neural fate decisions through the actions of short and
long ncRNAs.

Conclusion
Individual transcriptional and epigenetic states define cell identity and function in the nervous system.94,107 Progressive changes
in profiles of gene activation and repression, long-term gene
silencing and hierarchies of epigenetic modifications (including alterations at single genomic loci as well as those that are
genome-wide and associated with nuclear reorganization108) that
occur in response to discreet cell autonomous, cell-cell and environmental signals are therefore responsible for mediating neural lineage elaboration. Individual and cooperative REST and
CoREST complexes with distinct macromolecular assemblies
are likely deployed in a genome-wide and cell type-specific manner; are key nodes in the regulatory circuitry mediating diverse
transcriptional, post-transcriptional, as well as local- and longdistance epigenetic processes; and are highly integrated with
neural developmental signaling and effector pathways. Thus,
REST and CoREST appear to define the overall transcriptional
