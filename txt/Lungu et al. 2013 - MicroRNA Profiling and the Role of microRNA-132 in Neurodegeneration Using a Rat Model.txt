MicroRNAs (miRs) are endogenous small RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional
level by mediating mRNA degradation or transcriptional inhibition. MiRs were implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this study we
analyzed the possible role of miRs in the neurodegenerative process in a spontaneous autosomal recessive rat model for neurodegeneration developed in our laboratory. To investigate the role of miRs in
the etiology of PD, we conducted miR expression proﬁling using microarrays. We found 20 miRs that are
deregulated in affected rats and many of these are implicated in neurodegenerative disease, including PD.
In this study we were particularly interested in the expression of miR-132, a miR that has been reported
to be highly expressed in neurons, and to have a potential role in neurodegenerative diseases. We found
a signiﬁcant increase in miR-132 in affected rats by microarray and the result was conﬁrmed by qPCR.
Next we analyzed one of the known downstream targets of miR-132, nuclear receptor related 1 protein
(Nurr1), which is essential in neurogenesis of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Western blot analysis
and immunohistochemistry revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in Nurr1 protein expression in the mesencephalic neurons. Finally, we found a signiﬁcant decrease in both serum and mesencephalon brain tissue
of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is known to be a direct target of Nurr1. Taken together,
our ﬁndings suggest that miR-132 can regulate Nurr1 levels and might inﬂuence the development and
function of midbrain dopaminergic neurons.

1. Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an age-related and the second
most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer disease, affecting 1–2% of the population over 60 years old with no
cure [8]. This disease is characterized by motor symptoms such as
resting tremor, slowness of initial movement, rigidity and general
postural instability. The neurodegenerative process in PD affects
the midbrain dopamine projections from the substantia nigra with

disruption of dopamine transmission in the motor loop of the basal
ganglia [33,37].
A spontaneous autosomal recessive rat animal model for neurodegeneration was developed in our laboratory [33]. These rats
demonstrated progressive increases in ␣-synuclein (␣-syn) in the
brain mesencephalon, followed by loss of the dopamine terminal in
the basal ganglia and motor impairments. Decreased dopamine and
overexpression of ␣-syn in the brain mesencephalon provide a naturally occurring animal model of PD and other synucleinopathies.
MicroRNAs (miRs) are non-coding RNAs identiﬁed as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression with relevant roles in
physiological and pathological aspects of the central nervous system [4,13]. Several studies have described a potential role of miRs
in the development of PD [14,15,19]. Recent studies have shown
that miR-132 overexpression in embryonic stem cells reduces the

differentiation of dopaminergic neurons and directly downregulates nuclear receptor related protein 1(Nurr1) expression and
identiﬁed Nurr1 as a transcription factor essential for the survival
and/or maintenance of mesencephalon dopaminergic neurons [39].
Nurr1 is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily and is
highly expressed in the developing and in adult ventral midbrain
[6]. Nurr 1 is required for the acquisition and maintenance of the
dopaminergic phenotype in nigrostriatal neurons [28]. A decline
in Nurr1 expression correlates with loss of tyrosine hydroxylase
[5,29]. Recently, Nurr1 mutant mice were recognized as a potential model for PD [5,18]. It was demonstrated that a decrease in
Nurr1 gene expression is followed by a decrease in brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA and protein levels and identiﬁed
Bdnf as a putative Nurr-1-regulated gene [35].
BDNF has emerged as a major regulator of neuronal survival.
BDNF is a potent dopaminergic neurotrophin and its decrease is
reported in the substantia nigra of PD patients, especially in the
pars compacta [17,24,40] and in serum of PD patients [30].
Here we analyzed the possible role of miRs in the neurodegenerative process in a spontaneous autosomal recessive rat model
for neurodegeneration developed in our laboratory. We particularly focused on deregulation of miR-132 and the proteins Nurr1,
a known downstream target of miR-132, and BDNF. Our ﬁndings
suggest that miRs can regulate important targets that can inﬂuence the function of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and can be
potential therapeutic targets for the neurodegenerative diseases.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Brains from Berlin-Druckrey IV (BD-IV) affected and from agematched control (BD-IV littermate) rats were used. The background
of this rat colony was previously described [33]. All animal procedures were performed according to the protocol approved by the
Texas A&M University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
2.2. Tissue processing and collection
For western blot (WB), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA), miR microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis rats were sacriﬁced
by decapitation and mesencephalon brain areas, were immediately removed after death and placed on dry ice. Brains from
BD-IV affected rats (n = 3) and from control BD-IV rats (n = 3) at
25 days post natal (dpn) were used for WB and were used at 10,
22 and 24 dpn for ELISA. For immunohistochemistry (IHC), BD-IV
affected (n = 3) and control (n = 3) rats at 25 dpn under anesthesia
(ketamine hydrochloride, 1.5 mL/kg, 75 mg/kg [Phoenix Scientiﬁc,
Inc., St. Joseph, MO, USA] and Xylazine, 0.5 mL/kg, 10 mg/kg [Bayer
AG, Pittsburgh, PA, USA]) were perfused via the left ventricle with
2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution (Electron Microscopy Science,
Hatsﬁeld, PA, USA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2 at 4 ◦ C)
using a peristaltic pump. For miR microarray and qPCR analyses
total RNA was extracted using an SV RNA extraction kit (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). RNA was quantiﬁed by absorbance at 260 nm.

Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Sections that were not
incubated with primary antibody served as negative controls.
2.4. Western blot
WB was carried out as previously described [22]. Nuclear
extracts were prepared from the mesencephalon brain area
from affected and control rats as previously described [21].
The membranes were incubated with anti-Nurr1 (Abcam) and
␤-actin antibody from Sigma–Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis,
MO, USA). Peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(1:5000) were purchased from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories
(Gaithersburg, MD, USA).
2.5. ELISA
The levels of BDNF were measured in serum samples and mesencephalon brain tissues from affected (n = 3) and control (n = 3) rats.
Serum and tissue levels of BDNF were measured by BDNF sandwich ELISA, using a commercial kit according to the manufacturer
instructions (Millipore).
2.6. MicroRNA microarray analysis
MiR microarray analysis was performed on BD-IV affected rats
(n = 3) and control (n = 3) littermates at 25 dpn using miRNA chips
containing 700 mature rat miRs (Chip ID miRRat 19.0 version,
LC Sciences, Houston, TX, USA), as described in the literature
[10,12,13]. Data were analyzed by ﬁrst subtracting the background
and then normalizing the signals using a LOWESS ﬁlter (Locallyweighted Regression) [2]. For two color experiments, the ratio of
the two sets of detected signals (log 2 transformed, balanced) and
p-values of the t-test were calculated.
2.7. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR)
qRT-PCR was performed to verify the miR-132 levels in BVIV affected (n = 3) and control (n = 3) rats at 25 dpn using TaqMan
microRNA assays (Applied Biosystems) by LC Sciences (LC Sciences,
Houston, TX). All samples were analyzed in duplicate.
2.8. Statistical analysis
For microarray data the normalization was carried out using
a cyclic LOWESS (Locally-weighted Regression) method [26]. A
t-test was performed between “control” and “affected” sample
groups. miRs with p-values below a critical p-value (typically
0.01) were selected for cluster analysis. The clustering was done
using hierarchical method and was performed with average
linkage and Euclidean distance metric [9]. Densitometry analysis of WB bands was performed on a Macintosh computer
using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the
US National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet
at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). All data are presented as
mean ± SD and P-values were calculated using Student’s unpaired
t-test. Statistical signiﬁcance was taken at P < 0.05.
3. Results

2.3. Immunohistochemistry
IHC was carried out as previously described [22]. Anti-Nurr1
antibody was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA).
Following the primary antibody reaction, sections were washed
and incubated with anti-mouse (1:200 dilution) IgG (Vector

3.1. miRNA expression proﬁling and their role in
neurodegeneration
To investigate the role of miRs in neurodegeneration in our animal model, we conducted miR expression proﬁling in the brain of

affected and control BD-IV rats using microarray analysis. We analyzed 720 different miRs among which three miRs (miR 15b-3p,
miR-17-5p and miR 29b-5p) had a p-value < 0.01 and 17 miRs had
a p-value < 0.05 (Fig. 1A).
Several miRs were found to be deregulated in our animal
model. We found signiﬁcant down-regulation of miR-17-5p, miR20a, miR-93, miR-106 in the affected rats compared with controls
(Table 1). Studies showed that inhibition of miR-17-5p, miR20a, miR-93, miR-106, which share extensive sequence similarity,
leads to G1 checkpoint due to the accumulation of DNA double
strand breaks, resulting from premature temporal accumulation of
the E2F transcription factor [6,27,34]. These miRs were found to
regulate adult neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation [3,11]. Two other important miRs found to
be up-regulated in affected rats were miR-29a and miR-29b. Upregulation of miR-29b was found to promote neuronal cell death
by inhibiting Bcl-2-like protein 2 (Bcl2L2) and induced myeloid
leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl-1), an anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family member [25,31,38] and are also implicated in apoptosis
and involved in mitochondrial deregulation [1]. These may be of
interest in our model and need to be further explored, as we have
found a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, decrease in
Complex 1 enzymatic activity and oxidative stress in affected rats
compared with controls (unpublished data).

protein expression in the nucleus of mesencephalic neurons of affected BD-IV rats (E, F) (red arrows) at 25 dpn when compared with age-matched control littermates (C, D)
(red arrows). No staining was found in the negative control sections.

Finally, miR-132 was found to be up-regulated in our animal model. miR-132 was found to be necessary for the proper
development, maturation and function of neurons and whose
deregulation was associated with several neurological disorders
including PD, Alzheimer’s and Schizophrenia [23,36]. MiR-132 was
recently designated as a “NeurimmiR”, a class of miRNAs regulating
both neuronal and immune function [32]. miR-132 is an important molecule regulating embryonic stem cell differentiation into
dopaminergic neurons by directly targeting Nurr1 gene expression
[39].
3.2. qPCR analysis of miR-132
To conﬁrm the up-regulation of miR-132 microarray result we
performed qPCR analysis for miR-132. The results conﬁrm the upregulation of miR-132 in the brain of BD-IV affected rats at 25 dpn
(Fig. 1B).
3.3. Nurr1 is down-regulated in affected rats
Considering that Nurr1 was recently found to be downregulated by miR-132 [39], and miR-132 is found to be up-regulated
in our affected rats, we analyzed the levels of Nurr1 protein in the
nuclear extracts of mesencephalic neurons of affected and control
rats at 25 dpn by WB and IHC. WB showed a signiﬁcant decrease of
Nurr1 protein expression in the affected rats when compared with
control littermates (Fig. 2A and B). IHC analysis showed a signiﬁcant loss of Nurr1 staining in the nuclei of affected mesencephalic
neurons in affected rats (Fig. 2E and F) when compared with control
animals (Fig. 2C and D).
3.4. BDNF serum and brain tissue levels are down-regulated in
affected rats
RNA interference experiments showed that decreased Nurr1
expression is followed by tyrosine hydroxylase and BDNF mRNA
and protein down-regulation [35]. Here we evaluated the expression of BDNF in both serum and mesencephalon brain tissue

samples. We found a signiﬁcant down-regulation in BDNF both in
serum samples and the mesencephalon of affected rats at 24 dpn
(Fig. 3).

4. Discussion
Our data identiﬁed several miRs that are deregulated in our animal model for neurodegeneration. These miRs were also found to
be either up- or down-regulated in human neurodegenerative diseases such as PD, Alzheimer’s and Schizophrenia [23,36]. One miR
that was down-regulated in the affected rats was miR-17-5p, which
was found to be the key regulator of the G1/S phase cell cycle transition [6] and along with its family members, miR-20a, miR-93 and
miR-106, which are all found to be down-regulated in our affected
rats, function to control the differentiation of stem cells [11]. It was
also demonstrated a 2-fold increase in the E2F transcription factor upon inhibition of miR-17-5p and its family members [16,27].
These ﬁndings suggest that cell-cycle regulators may be effective
targets for therapeutic strategies aimed at slowing or halting neurodegeneration in PD.
Next, we analyzed the expression of miR-132 and its downstream target. Our miR microarray results and qPCR analysis
showed a signiﬁcant up-regulation of miR-132 in affected rats. Previous studies showed that miR-132 regulates the differentiation
of dopaminergic neurons by directly targeting Nurr1 expression
[39]. Nurr1 is one of the most important transcription factors
in determining dopaminergic neuron development and differentiation [39]. Our results showed a signiﬁcant decrease in Nurr1
protein levels in the brain mesencephalon of affected rats. Previous studies also showed that Nurr1 is essential for induction of the
mesencephalic dopamine phenotype and for the survival and/or
maintenance of these neurons [20]. The decline in Nurr 1 expression
was correlated with the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase [5]. We previously reported a signiﬁcant loss of tyrosine hydroxylase in affected
rats by western blot [33]. Moreover, it was found that decreased
Nurr1 protein expression was related to ␣-syn aggregation in the
substantia nigra in PD [5]. A recent study also described Nurr1

as a key player in the cellular defense against ␣-syn toxicity and
highlighted Nurr1 as a promising new target for neuroprotective
therapy [7]. The studies regarding Nurr1 and ␣-syn are particularly
relevant for our study as we have previously reported a signiﬁcant
increase in ␣-syn protein and mRNA expression in the mesencephalon of affected rats and also an increased oligomerization of
␣-syn [33]. Considering the importance of Nurr1 in neuroprotection, the development of drugs designed to activate Nurr1 function
may hold particular promise.
Finally, our results showed a signiﬁcant decrease in BDNF levels both in serum and in mesencephalon brain areas of affected
BD-IV rats at 25 dpn but not at earlier time points. BDNF is a neurotrophin known to exert trophic effects on many neuronal types
including midbrain dopaminergic neurons [35]. The decrease in
BDNF levels in our affected rats can be a consequence of both ␣syn overexpression and decreased Nurr1 transcription factor. It was
demonstrated by Yuan et al. that overexpression of ␣-syn downregulates BDNF expression [40]. Therefore, it is highly likely that BDNF
down-regulation might play an important role in the pathogenesis
of PD.
In conclusion, we found up-regulation of miR-132 and a significant decrease of Nurr1 and BDNF levels in the mesencephalon of
affected rats. We will focus our future studies on increasing Nurr1
levels in affected rats by decreasing miR-132 expression using RNA
interferance in order to study the role of Nurr1 in our rat model.
It is of particular interest in our model to determine whether
the overexpression of miR-132 is associated with alpha-synclein
accumulation and aggregation and whether the increase in miR132 expression is the cause or the effect of the accumulation and
aggregation of alpha-synuclein. It is possible that dopaminergic

neurons, which respond to global stress due to accumulation of
alpha-synuclein, activate miR-132, thereby shutting down Nurr1
and decreases BDNF, a major regulator of neuronal survival.
These data highlight miR-132 as promising potential biomarker
and target for neuroprotective therapy in PD. The developing of
drugs designed to decrease miR-132 activity may provide a novel
strategy for PD and for other synucleinopathies.
