Loss of neurons is typically the readout used for studies of neuropathological conditions
ranging from stroke and traumatic brain injury to adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases
such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s[1]. One result is that studies of neurodegenerative
disease often become descriptions of progressive neuronal cell death, and many therapeutic
strategies focus on preventing cell death [2, 3]. Unfortunately, successes in reducing or
preventing neuronal cell death have not translated to effective treatments for any
neurodegenerative disease [4–6]. The problem is that neurodegenerative diseases are not
caused by cell death signaling pathways. Although apoptotic pathways will eventually be
activated and neurons lost as the disease progresses, the clinical symptoms of
neurodegenerative diseases reflect abnormalities in synaptic function and the loss of
synaptic connections, rather than the loss of neurons. Conflating the shared molecular
mechanisms of cell death with unique disease-specific pathogenic mechanisms of
neurodegeneration may be interfering with the search for effective therapies.

Although the final common steps in cell death pathways (i.e., nuclear fragmentation, etc.)
are shared between neuronal and nonneuronal cells[7, 8], the sequence of events leading to
cell death in neurons may include steps not found in nonneuronal cells[9]. Neuron-specific
features may involve an extended period of time, often months or years, in contrast with the
rapid progression of apoptosis observed in non-neuronal cells[10]. These initial neuronspecific steps manifest as a loss of synaptic function, a process initiated at a considerable
distance from the neuronal perikaryon. Complicating the situation further, components of
cell death signaling pathways can play roles in neurons unrelated to cell death, such as
regulating aspects of synaptic function and plasticity[11–13].

Neuron-specific cell death features
A brief consideration of some unique aspects of cell death in neurons may be useful. Both
extrinsic and mitochondrial-based pathways of apoptotic cell death can be observed in
neurons[8, 10, 14], depending on the triggering stimulus. The initiators of cell death may be
as diverse as failure to establish trophic relationships with a target cell, stroke and traumatic
brain injury, or neurodegenerative disease, regardless of whether they are environmental,
familial or sporadic in origin. Both apoptotic and necrotic cell death may be observed in
neurons [8], but here we will focus on apoptotic mechanisms. Perhaps the most obvious

difference between neuronal and non-neuronal cell death is the time that takes to complete
apoptosis. The final stages of apoptotic cell death are rapid and similar in both neuronal and
nonneuronal cells. However, in neurons the early stages begin in the distal axon and
presynaptic terminals and progress slowly. Months or even years may elapse between the
first decrements in neuronal function and the initiation of a final apoptotic sequence.

The ways in which cell death pathways are managed in neurons differ from nonneuronal
cells. The enormous size and complex functional architecture of neurons requires additional
layers of complexity, which are seen both in development and in pathological states. Cell
death plays a critical role in sculpting the functional architecture of the nervous system
during development [9, 15]. During development, programmed cell death via apoptosis
assures that appropriate matches exist between neurons and their target cells. Nuclear
changes are late events and the first steps leading toward developmental neuronal death
typically occur in synaptic and axonal compartments. If these steps are limited in scope and
extent, synaptic and axonal changes might lead to pruning of nonproductive synaptic
contacts or axonal branches[9]. Such pruning is essential for establishing sensory maps in
the cortex such as those corresponding to visual space [16]. The atrophy of an axonal branch
follows shutdown of synaptic function and degeneration of the presynaptic terminal, with
subsequent degeneration of the distal axon. The distal axonopathy seen in early stages of
neurodegenerative disease follows a similar sequence but involves a most or all of the
presynaptic terminals in an affected neuron. The result is a classic dying-back
neuropathy[17–19].
The sequence of events associated with loss of presynaptic function and degeneration of
distal axons may be prolonged for years after the first decrement in synaptic function take
place [10, 20]. This is in large part due to the size and complex morphology of neurons,
which create an abundance of heterogenous microdomains and provide new arenas for cell
death-related molecular components to perform diverse functions. In some neurons,
activation of kinases or caspases in a presynaptic compartment may occur a meter or more
away from the nucleus. This topographic separation prevents the interaction with key
downstream targets required for the progression and execution of apoptosis. Under these
conditions, the critical apoptosis executioner caspase-3[11, 12, 21] and pro-apoptotic kinases
like JNK [22–25] may be activated in a pre- or postsynaptic compartment, but apoptosis
does not result. A growing body of evidence indicates that some components of cell death
pathways may play important roles in normal neuronal functions like the synaptic plasticity
that underlies learning and memory[11–13].

However, a failure in the trophic relationships of neurons with target cells does trigger
apoptosis in neurons[26–28]. This is due to the uniquely symbiotic relationship between a
given neuron and the hundreds or thousands of other cells that interact with that neuron.
Important interactions are associated with presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations as
well as with diverse glial cells. Target cells (i.e., muscle cells, other neurons, etc.) act as a
source of neurotrophins, which in turn promote survival of neurons innervating these targets.
The neuron integrates these various relationships in ways that are incompletely understood.
This integration is essential not only for neuronal survival, but also for determining size,
morphology and various functional aspects of the neuron. Moreover, these trophic
relationships are tightly tied to neuronal activity, so only productive relationships are
preserved[29, 30].

Synaptic function and neurotrophin-dependent neuronal survival
How then does a neuron progress to apoptosis either in development or in slowly
progressing adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? In both, the apoptotic process occurs as a dying-back
neuropathy or distal axonopathy[31], following a characteristic sequence of events (Figure
1). Lack of effective synaptic activity coupling neurotransmitter release to neurotrophin
uptake will initiate degeneration of the presynaptic terminal[9, 17]. Loss of synaptic activity
may result from reductions in critical components for neurotransmitter release in the
presynaptic compartment or by failure of appropriate responses (i.e., trophic support) from
target cells. In disease states, deficiencies in presynaptic components may be more common,
while during development inadequate neurotrophin supplies from nonresponsive targets is
more likely. For example, blockade of neurotrophin uptake during development interferes
with the establishment of ocular dominance columns[32]. Similarly, both uptake and
retrograde transport of neurotrophins by sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia is needed to
prevent cell death of these sensory neurons[33]. Survival of motor neurons in the spinal cord
is also dependent on neuronal activity[34] and activity dependent release of neurotrophins is
critical for their biological actions[35]. Although a full review of the actions of
neurotrophins on synaptic plasticity[36, 37] and neuronal survival is beyond the scope of
this perspective, a number of reviews have considered this issue[35, 38–41]. Regardless,
both formation and maintenance of neuronal connections are closely linked to establishment
of trophic relationships with target cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In a healthy connection, the release of neurotrophins from target cells leads to binding of
neurotrophins to neuronal receptors, uptake of receptor-neurotrophin complexes into the
neuron, and eventually transport of these complexes to the distant neuronal cell body. There
is a close relationship between synaptic function and neurotrophin support, so neurotrophin
uptake correlates with the release of neurotransmitter from the synapse [42, 43]. In turn,
elevated neurotransmitter levels at the synapse stimulates release of neurotrophins from the
target cell and helps maintain postsynaptic structures as well as enhancing endocytosis in the
presynaptic terminal[43]. For neurotrophic influences to be effective, receptors with bound
ligand must be endocytosed and processed into a signaling endosome for return to the cell
body[44–47]. Both local and perikaryal signaling by neurotrophin receptors are important in
the maintenance of presynaptic function [29, 30]. An appropriate supply of synaptic
components and neurotrophin receptors from the neuronal perikaryon to synapses and the
corresponding return of signaling endosomes to the neuronal cell body are both essential
processes for neuronal survival. From these observations, it is clear that the intracellular
trafficking of synaptic and trophic factor components along axons plays a critical role in
maintaining neuronal viability.

Axonal Transport: A vital supply line for synapses
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As discussed above, synaptic activity and neurotrophic factor support represent critical
cellular processes underlying the neuronal survival. An understanding of apoptotic cell death
in neurons thus requires an analysis of molecular mechanisms underlying maintenance and
functionality of synapses. Neurons are uniquely dependent on intracellular transport of
proteins and organelles[18, 48]. Human neurons may be a meter or more in length and even
small mammalian neurons are significantly larger than nonneuronal cells. Their large size
imposes certain demands on a neuron, but the polarization and complexity of neuronal
morphologies creates further challenges. A typical neuron has thousands of pre- and postsynaptic specializations. Some of these may be maintained for decades and others must be
rapidly adjusted in response to local signals. The ability of synapses to respond to localized
signals requires alterations in their biochemical composition. Despite periodic reports that
small amounts of protein synthesis may occur in axons (particularly growing axons),
>99.9% of the proteins in axonal domains and >80% of the proteins in dendrites of mature
neurons are synthesized in cell bodies and transported to sites of utilization [48]. As a result,
neuronal cells face daunting logistical challenges in the coordinate synthesis, packaging,

transport and targeting of proteins to pre and postsynaptic compartments. To fullfill this
need, neurons must continually synthesize, transport and deliver remarkable amounts of
membrane proteins, mitochondria, cytoskeletal elements, and cytoplasmic enzymes via
axonal transport mechanisms [48]. This dependence of axons and synapses on delivery of
material from the cell body was recognized as early as Ramon y Cajal[49], although the
responsible molecular motors were not discovered until the 1980’s[50]. At that time,
advances in digital video microscopy methods permitted real time visualization of individual
membrane bounded organelles (MBOs) moving along single microtubules (MTs) in living
cells for the first time. Application of video microscopic methods to axoplasm isolated from
squid giant axons[51] produced real time images of MBOs translocating on MTs and
allowed biochemical and pharmacological characterization of fast axonal transport (FAT)
[51–56]. Studies of FAT in axoplasm led to the discovery of conventional kinesin, a new
class of molecular motor that defined a superfamily of proteins [55–58]. Subsequently, a
cytoplasmic form of dynein [59] was identified. Although there are exceptions, most
kinesins move toward the plus end of MTs and dyneins are minus end motors. The polarized
distribution of MTs in the axon allows for kinesins to move MBOs from the cell body
towards the cell periphery in the anterograde direction and for dyneins to move MBOs from
the cell periphery towards the cell body in the retrograde direction [60, 61].

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cumulative evidence indicates that conventional kinesin is the main molecular motor
involved in the anterograde FAT of various MBOs, including mitochondria, synaptic
vesicles, and plasma membrane components. Signaling complexes (i.e., activated
neurotrophin receptors) and MBOs carrying degradation products (i.e., lysosomes and
multivesicular bodies) are transported retrogradely to the neuronal cell body by the multisubunit molecular motor cytoplasmic dynein [44, 50]. However, the complexity of neuronal
cell biology has also raised the issue of differential regulation of kinesins and dyneins [18,
62]. Coordination of kinesin and dynein-based FAT represents a critical component
underlying synaptic function and plasticity [63]. As discussed below, an establishment of
functional relationships between synaptic activity, trophic support and axonal transport has
shed important insights on the mechanisms underlying neuronal dysfunction and death in
various human neurodegenerative diseases.

Axonal transport and Dysferopathies

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases are among the most difficult and puzzling disorders
of the nervous system. Genes associated with these diseases have been identified and
characterization of pathogenic mutations constituted major breakthroughs. However,
identification of mutant genes often failed to illuminate specific pathogenic mechanisms.
Biological roles for the associated gene product were often not apparent. Some diseases
were associated with multiple mutations in a given gene or with mutations in different
unrelated genes that all resulted in comparable pathologies. Many diseases existed in both
familial and sporadic forms with indistinguishable clinical presentation. Moreover, a number
of these mutant proteins were expressed in a variety of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, but
only specific neuronal populations would be affected. Few of the identified mutations
explained either the unique vulnerability of neurons in these diseases, or why affected
neurons functioned normally for decades before appearance of pathology. However, one
class of neurodegeneration-associated genes were illuminating
Recently, evidence that alteration in motor function may underlie some neuropathologies
has accumulated [18, 62, 64–67], and these typically manifest as neurodegenerative diseases
with the features of a dying back neuropathy[19]. For example, loss of function mutations
leading to a 50% reduction in the kinesin-1 isoform kinesin-1A (representing approximately
10% of total kinesin-1 in motor neurons) leads to a form of spastic paraplegia[68, 69], a

disease involving gradual degeneration of upper motor neurons. Similarly, mutations in the
cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain subunit [67, 70] or dynactin[71] result in late onset
neurodegeneration of specific neuronal populations. Curiously, some mutations in dynein
heavy chain lead to motor neuron degeneration[67] while other mutations produce
degeneration of sensory neurons[70]. Although mutations in motor proteins are rare and can
account for only a small fraction of neurodegenerative diseases, recent evidence indicates
that FAT may be affected in a much larger fraction of neurodegenerative diseases. These
alterations occurred through changes in the activity of protein kinases involved in regulation
of FAT [19]. Diseases that involve compromises in FAT as an intrinsic element in their
pathogenesis may be categorized as dysferopathies (from the Greek “fero” meaning to
transport or carry)[19, 72].

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The complexity of neuronal cell biology raised the issue of differential regulation of kinesins
and dyneins [18, 62]. Altered protein phosphorylation is a common feature of
neurodegenerative diseases, and several kinase and phosphatase activities have been
implicated in the regulation of FAT through phosphorylation of motor protein subunits
(reviewed by Morfini et al[18, 62]). These kinase pathways affect a variety of cellular
activities, including pro-apoptotic pathways. However, in cases where adult-onset, slowly
progressive neurodegeneration is observed, compromised FAT is likely to be a primary
lesion leading to loss of neuronal connectivity and eventually to neuronal cell death.
Significantly, kinases activated in some of these dysferopathies include ones with proapoptotic activity, including JNK, P38, PKC, and GSK3β[73–79].
For example, Alzheimer’s disease neurons with familial Alzheimer’s disease mutations in
presenilin-1 (PS1) increased activity of GSK-3β, a regulator of kinesin-based motility in
neurons[80] and a facilitator of apoptosis[73]. Analysis of FAT in PS-1 mutant neurons
showed a 20%–30% reduction in kinesin-based motility[81]. The tau filaments present in the
neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of both familial and sporadic Alzheimer’s brains[82]
also activate GSK3β in neurons and affect FAT[83]. Subsequently, oligomeric forms of the
Aβ peptide associated with the amyloid characteristic of Alzheimer’s was found to activate
casein kinase 2, which also inhibits FAT[84] and leads to failure of synaptic
transmission[85]. In some cases, CK2 may be antiapoptotic in some cellular contexts[79],
but in Alzheimer’s elevated CK2 activity has the paradoxical effect in shutting down FAT
and hastening loss of synaptic connectivity.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Similarly, polyQ expansion diseases like Huntington’s disease and spinal bulbar muscular
atrophy lead to activation of the stress activated protein kinase JNK3, which phosphorylates
kinesin and reduces FAT[86, 87]. JNK family kinases are well known pro-apoptotic kinases,
although they can also be protective in some situations[77, 78]. In neurons, this dual role
may depend on different JNK isoforms, because JNK1 activity appears to be essential and
constitutive, while stressors activate JNK3 (a neuron-specific JNK) and neuronal damage
[88]. Significantly, JNK3 inhibits FAT, while JNK1 does not[87]. Finally, exposure to
certain toxic agents like MPTP lead to a form of Parkinson’s disease[89, 90]. MPTP and its
metabolites activate caspase 3[72, 91], but this occurs in primarily in axons and terminals
where dopamine transporters are enriched. When caspase 3 activated in the axon or the
terminal, it cleaves and activates PKCδ[72, 92], which in turn alters FAT and leads to failure
of neurotransmission[72, 93]. Thus, activation of pro-apoptotic signals in neurons can lead
to deficits in FAT that eventually result in loss of synaptic function and distal axonopathy.

Summary
Although neuronal cell death through apoptotic pathways represents a common feature of
dysferopathies, the canonical apoptotic changes familiar from non-neuronal cells are late

events. Loss of neuronal function occurs at a much early time, when synaptic-based
neuronal connectivity fails. In this context, apoptotic pathways may normally serve a cleanup role, rather than a pathogenic one. Reframing the consideration of cell death in the
nervous system to include the early stages of axonal degeneration provides a better
understanding of the roles played by various apoptotic signaling pathways in
neurodegenerative diseases. Focusing on disease-specific mechanisms that initiate the
sequence that eventually leads to neuronal loss should facilitate development of therapies
that preserve neuronal function as well as neuronal numbers.

Figure 1. Stages in neuronal death as a dying back neuropathy

A) In the intact nervous system, neurons and targets are well matched, so activity and
neurotrophic support (green arrows) are well-coordinated. B) When the activity at a given
synapse is compromised, then presynaptic terminals are retracted and neurotrophin return is
reduced. Changes in gene expression may occur, but the perikaryon is still intact at this
stage. C) When the number of functional synapses falls below a critical threshold, the
remaining presynaptic terminals are typically shut down and retracted. Consequently, targetderived neurotrophin supplies are no longer sufficient to maintain the distal axon or to
sustain neuronal viability. D) As the distal axon atrophies, the neuronal perikaryon begins to
exhibit the characteristics of classical apoptotic cell death, including pycnotic nuclei,
shrinkage of cell body, TUNEL staining and blebbing of the plasma membrane. The time
from the earliest changes in synaptic function seen in B to the clear activation of apoptotic
pathways in D may be months or years.
