Abstract The study of a class of small non-coding RNA molecules, named microRNAs (miRNAs), has advanced our understanding of many of the fundamental processes of cancer biology
and the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor initiation and progression. MiRNA research
has become more and more attractive as evidence is emerging that miRNAs likely play important regulatory roles virtually in all essential bioprocesses. Looking at this field over the past
decade it becomes evident that our understanding of miRNAs remains rather incomplete. As
research continues to reveal the mechanisms underlying cancer therapy efficacy, it is clear
that miRNAs contribute to responses to drug therapy and are themselves modified by drug therapy. One important area for miRNA research is to understand the functions of miRNAs and the
relevant signaling pathways in the initiation, progression and drug-resistance of tumors to be
able to design novel, effective targeted therapeutics that directly target pathologically essential miRNAs and/or their target genes. Another area of increasing importance is the use of miRNA signatures in the diagnosis and prognosis of various types of cancers. As the study of noncoding RNAs is increasingly more popular and important, it is without doubt that the next
several years of miRNA research will provide more fascinating results.

hundred other miRNA molecules. MiRNAs are short noncoding RNA molecules of roughly 19e24 nucleotides in
length and are a large class, with more than 1,000 members, of small-regulatory RNAs in mammalian genomes.
MiRNAs are initially processed as a primary miRNA (primiRNA) transcript by RNA polymerase II (or by RNA polymerase III in rare cases) and associated transcription factors. The pri-miRNAs are further processed by Drosha, a
nuclear RNase III enzyme, to produce precursor miRNAs
(pre-miRNAs). The pre-miRNAs are then transported out of

the nucleus into the cytoplasm where they are further
processed by the Dicer, another RNase III-familial endonuclease, to become w22 base-pairing (bp) miRNA duplexes.
Mature miRNAs are then unwound from miRNA duplexes and
loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The
RISC with the mature miRNAs can regulate gene expression
by binding to the mRNA transcripts of target genes, usually
at the 30 untranslated regions (30 -UTRs). The miRNA-RISC
complex can block translation of target mRNA into protein
and/or induce degradation of target mRNA transcript (see
Fig. 1).6e8
Binding of an animal miRNA to its target gene transcript
relies mainly on a 6e8 nucleotide pair region of near perfect complementarity between the 50 end (i.e., the ‘seed
region’) of the miRNA and its target mRNA sequence.
Although miRNAs usually bind to the 30 UTRs of target
transcripts, evidence is emerging that the target sites can
be located outside of the 30 UTRs, such as 50 untranslated
regions (50 -UTRs) or protein-coding regions. Interestingly,
recent studies have demonstrated that allelic and sequence
variants can i) create a new miRNA binding site where one
did not exist before, ii) remove a miRNA binding site, or iii)
change the affinity of a particular miRNA for a binding
site.9,10 Furthermore, as a single miRNA can regulate tens
or even hundreds of different target genes while a single
gene may be regulated by multiple miRNAs; the miRNAtarget networks are pretty complex.

pathogenesis of tumors and the potential clinical implications of miRNAs in the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of

cancers. First, it will outline the functions of miRNAs in
cancer biology as tumor suppressors and/or oncogenes and
how miRNAs can synergistically work together. Next, it will
discuss miRNAs related to cancer therapy/treatment.
Finally, it will focus on miRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic
tools in the context of the tumor itself and circulating in
blood plasma.

The regulations and functions of MiRNAs in
cancers
For the past ten years the study of miRNAs in eukaryotic
organisms has grown exponentially and it has been well
established that these small RNAs are master regulators of
gene expression and multiple other biological processes.
MiRNAs were first identified in the mid-1990s with the discovery of Let-7 and Lin-4 in a worm (Caenorhabditis elegans),1,2,11 but it was not until 2000/2001 when it was
determined that these miRNAs exist and are highly
conserved in multiple eukaryotic organisms and mammalian
species.3e5 This was a major finding in the field of miRNAs,
showing not only that they exist in multiple organisms but
also they are likely major regulators of biological processes
in these organisms. The next landmark event came soon
after in 2002 and 2003 when it was found that miRNAs were
aberrantly expressed in cancer12e14 and subsequently
several seminal studies were reported in 2005 that provided
compelling evidence to demonstrate the importance of
miRNAs in cancer.15e17 Since then, the study of miRNAs in

Figure 1 Processing of microRNA. RNA polymerase II and appropriate transcription factors stimulate transcription of the
microRNA gene (A) into a primary long transcript with a stem loop structure called a primary microRNA transcript (pri-miR). The
primary transcript (B) is then processed by Drosha, an RNAase III enzyme, to produce a small precursor hairpin microRNA (pre-miR).
The precursor microRNA (C) is then shuttled outside the nucleus by Exportin to the cytoplasm for further process. In the cytoplasm
the precursor microRNA is then processed into a mature 19e24 nucleotide duplex (D) by another RNAase enzyme Dicer. Next, the
duplex is split into a primary and secondary strand (E); then the primary strand is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex
(RISC). Next the microRNA with RISC targets specific messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts (F) at the seed region to induce either
mRNA degradation (left) or block translation (right).

cancer exploded dramatically and still represents a very
important and challenging area of research (see examples
in Tables 1 and 2).
Furthermore, it is becoming evident that an emerging
hallmark of cancer is the dysregulation of miRNAs, both in
the tumor itself and in the surrounding microenvironment.
Future work in this field will undoubtedly ensure its position
in the new hallmarks of cancer.18 Dysregulated miRNAs can
contribute to tumorigenesis by playing tumor-suppressive
and/or oncogenic roles. As exampled in Table 1, many
miRNAs, including miR-29b,19,20 miR-34b/c,21,22 miR126,23e27 miR-150,28 miR-155,29,30 miR-181a/b,31,32 miR375,33 miR-494,34 miR-49535,36 and miR-551a,35 play critical
tumor-suppressor roles in tumorigenesis and/or mark a
good prognosis for patients. These miRNAs have shown to
have potent antitumorigenic properties. However, there
are also numerous oncogenic miRNAs including miR-9,37
miR-17-92,38e40 miR-21,41 miR-27a,42 miR-30a/c,43, miR126,44 miR-181a/b,45e47 miR-196a,48 miR-196b,49 and miR421.50 The intricate role of miRNAs in tumorigenesis appears to be simple yet it remains complicated. This can be
attributed to several reasons briefly reviewed in the
following section.

There is enormous complexity in miRNA-mediated
gene regulation
First, a single miRNA can regulate up to hundreds of genes51e54 (while prediction programs can suggest thousands of
genes that are targets of a single miRNA) making it difficult
to determine which genes are direct targets of a single
miRNA.55e58 Second, given the fact that a single mRNA
target contains potential binding sites for multiple individual miRNAs, a single gene can be regulated simultaneously or sequentially by multiple miRNAs.55e57 Third, a
single miRNA can regulate target mRNAs by both repressing

translation and inducing mRNA degradation within
mammalian species53,54,59e63 makes miRNA-mediated gene
regulation even complicated.
The mechanism underlying translational repression is
still unclear but it is known that the inhibition is determined by two potential criteria.6 The first criterion is
whether mRNAs are present in an mRNA-protein complex
(mRNP) for inhibition of initiation or in the form of large
polysomes involved in elongation inhibition.6,64e68 The
second criterion is whether inhibited mRNAs contain internal ribosome entry site (IRES).6,7,65,66,68 Although the
exact mechanisms leading to translational inhibition remain
unclear, several hypothesizes have been proposed.6e8,45e47
Notably, it was proposed that miRISC (miRNA loaded in
RISC) may repress the elongation process, thus miRISC has a
role in the promotion of early ribosome dissociation from
mRNAs.6e8,69 Another hypothesis is that the miRNA complex
mediates repression through accumulation of target RNA
transcripts in P-bodies (processing bodies) as P-bodies
containing mRNA have been suggested to not be part of the
translation process.7,70,71
Regulation of mRNA by miRNAs can also occur through
mRNA degradation and actually, mRNA destabilization
usually comprised the major component of repression in
mammalian species.72 It has been shown that miRNAs with
high degree of sequence complementation to target mRNA
can induce the mRNA degradation processes.7 While several
components of the complex are known to participate in
regulation of mRNA degradation it appears that mechanisms including deadenylation, decapping and exonucleolytic digestion of mRNA are also involved.6,7,65,66,68,73e75
The seed sequence similarity is thought to be important
in the initial selection of mRNA targets where the number,
type and position of mismatches of the miRNA/mRNA
complex is critical.6,7,76,77 Thus, the full downstream effects of a single miRNA may not be well understood until it

is clear exactly how that miRNA is inhibiting its potential
targets.

Expression of miRNAs can be regulated at both
transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels
Given the essential functions of miRNAs in maintaining
virtually all important biological processes, including
development, differentiation and apoptosis, the stringent
control of miRNAs, at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, is critical.78 Numerous studies have
analyzed the regulation of miRNAs at the transcription
sites, including direct binding by transcription factors,
hyper/hypomethylation of miRNA promoters, and changes
in histone assembly and chromatin packing.79e85
However, fewer studies have looked at the regulation of
miRNAs at downstream processing steps. It is important to
identify other cofactors existing in or cooperating with the
Drosha or Dicer complexes and how they assist the Drosha or
Dicer complexes in regulating the maturation or degradation
of miRNAs. We recently have shown that in a subtype of acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) that carries chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene,
the primary transcription of miR-150 is significantly upregulated by MLL-fusion proteins but its maturation process
is substantially inhibited by the MYC/LIN28 functional axis; as
a result, the level of mature miR-150 is significantly downregulated and thereby expression of its critical target genes
such as FLT3 and MYB is significantly up-regulated, which
ultimately lead to cell transformation and leukemogenesis.28

The function of miRNAs can be tissue-specific
A single miRNA may play distinct roles in different tissues.
For instance, the miR-181 family has traditionally been
described in several solid malignancies, such as breast,
liver and colon cancer, as an oncomiR (defined as a miRNA
that acts as an oncogene to promote tumorigenesis and

tumor progression)45e47; however, in AML this family acts as
tumor suppressor.31,32 Similarly, miR-126 has been previously reported as a tumor-suppressor gene in various types
of solid tumors including breast, lung, and colon cancers,
etc23e27; we recently found that miR-126 functions as an
oncogene in the development of leukemias, particularly
core-binding factor (CBF) leukemias bearing t(8;21) or
inv(16)/t(16;16).44 This concept is now widely accepted in
the scientific community and is in part attributed to the
ability of miRNAs to target different genes in different
tissues. For example, the miR-17-92 cluster, initially transcribed as a polycistronic transcript to later produce 6
mature miRNA transcripts, is overexpressed in lymphoma
and MLL-rearranged AML and plays an important oncogenic
role likely through repressing expression of its tumorsuppressor target genes such as Pten, Rassf2, and
p2116,38e40,86,87; in contrast, in breast cancer the miR-17-92
cluster functions as a tumor suppressor likely through
negatively regulating oncogenic target genes involved in
cell proliferation, cellular invasion, and tumor metastasis
such as AIB1 and CCND1.88e91
It is possible that different target genes are coexpressed with the miRNA regulators and thereby are
regulated by the miRNAs in distinct types of cells or tissues.
Another possibility is that the regulatory miRNAs are
recruited into different target transcripts in distinct types
of cells or tissues. It has been shown over the past several
years that there are multiple RNA-binding proteins that
assist in processing of miRNAs. For example, HnRNP A1, a
member of nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling proteins previously
implicated in mRNA metabolism, was shown to specifically
bind to pri-miR-18a and facilitated Drosha-mediated processing, thus acting as a key factor in regulation of miR-18a
processing.6,7,92,93 These messenger ribonucleoprotein
complexes (mRNPs) were critical in the inhibition of miRNA
targets. Thus, this might suggest that general RNA binding
proteins have an auxiliary function in the regulation of
miRNAs and probably may help to preferentially inhibit
different target genes in distinct types of cells or tissues.

MicroRNAs in Cancer

Individual miRNAs can regulate both oncogenes and
tumor suppressors simultaneously
Interestingly, a single miRNA can simultaneously regulate
both tumor suppressive and oncogenic target genes within a
single cancer. This was recently described in our paper from
Li et al (2012).49 In this paper we showed that miR-196b was
upregulated in MLL-rearranged AML and resulted in
repression of the tumor suppressor and pro-apoptotic genes
such as FAS; surprisingly, we found that miR-196b also
targets HOXA9/MEIS1, characterized oncogenes that are
co-upregulated with miR-196b by MLL-fusion proteins.49 In
normal hematopoiesis, miR-196b likely helps to fine-tune
expression of Hox genes and Meis1 in primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and to remove their residual
transcripts in committed progenitor cells to allow further
differentiation of the cells; when miR-196b is downregulated, Fas becomes up-regulated to maintain homeostasis of the cells.49 In MLL-fusion-mediated leukemogenesis, aberrant up-regulation of miR-196b by MLL fusions
results in the persistent repression of expression of its
tumor-suppressor targets (e.g. FAS ), along with the residual high level of HOXA9/MEIS1; as a result, aberrant overexpression of miR-196b inhibits differentiation, disrupts
cell homeostasis and promotes cell proliferation via inhibiting apoptosis, which eventually results in cell transformation and leukemogenesis.49 This means, despite what
was described previously, that a miRNA may not simply be
described as a tumor-suppressor or oncomiR as the scientific community has done in the past. This also implies that
tumor initiation and development, contributed by aberrant
regulation of miRNAs, might be more complex than previously thought and has important implications for using
miRNAs as a therapeutic avenue.

MiRNAs mediate drug response and themselves
are modulated in therapy
As miRNAs were being linked to several hallmarks of cancer in
tumor cells, there was a hypothesis that miRNA expression
could be altered by cancer therapy and associated with drug
response. This hypothesis is supported by two lines of evidence that are not mutually exclusive: differential expression of miRNAs in tumor cells before treatment has been
associated with response to chemotherapy; changes in
miRNA expression have been observed in cancer cells
following treatment with effective therapy. It is highly likely
that these observations are linked together within a single
cancer (see Fig. 2). For example, it was found within lung
cancer a group of miRNAs were regulated by epithelial
growth factor receptor (EGFR) and hepatocyte growth factor
receptor (MET).94 Both EGFR and MET are overexpressed in
lung cancer driving tumorigenesis and, interestingly, the
investigators found that these miRNAs bestowed resistance
to tyrosine kinase therapy.94 Specifically, they found that
gefitinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) treatment inhibited
miR-221, miR-222, miR-30b and miR-30c, all positively
regulated by EGFR and MET, and resulted in increased
apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines.94 Furthermore, increased
expression of miR-30c, miR-221 and miR-222 in gefitinibresponsive cells attenuated sensitivity and knockdown of

57
these miRNAs bestowed sensitivity to gefitinib in normally
gefitinib-insensitive cells.94
Meanwhile, the effect of metabolism or chemotherapybased diet on miRNA expression and subsequent tumorigenesis has also bee investigated. For example, Mandal
et al found that the bioactive component of fish oil, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), inhibited miR-21, a protumorigenic miRNA.41 Another group found the diet/microbederived short chain fatty acid butyrate, a known histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor used in cancer treatment
particularly in colon cancer, blocked tumorigenesis through
inhibiting miR-106b expression and subsequently promoting
expression of p21, a direct target of miR-106b.95 Similarly,
it was reported that butyrate resulted in decreased
expression of the oncogenic miRNA cluster miR-17-92; they
found this similar result was observed in other HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid (SAHA).96 Several of these inhibitors are
clinically approved for the treatment of a few cancers and
are currently being evaluated for other cancers, which
provide a novel avenue for research.
Together these results show that miRNAs both modulate
response to chemotherapy and are themselves modulated
by chemotherapy. These effects can be direct or through
indirect as are the examples of diet-induced miRNA
changes. The new wave of cancer therapy is focusing on
drugs that specifically target miRNAs as well as complementary signaling pathways to synergize with the routine
use of chemotherapy in cancer patients.

MiRNA-based cancer therapy
Due to the central role of miRNAs in cancer initiation and
progression, they have been a source of interest for several
years, specifically whether these miRNAs can be targeted or
not.97 As already described, it has been observed that
several drugs can alter miRNA expression. Moreover, if
certain cancers are particularly “addicted” to particular
miRNAs (named oncomiR addiction) then targeting specific
miRNAs selectively should minimize off-target toxicity.98
Investigators are interested in designing inhibitors for
oncogenic miRNAs and mimics for tumor-suppressor miRNAs
that can act alone or synergistically with currently
approved treatments (see Fig. 2).99
In the past ten years several methods of design of miRNA
inhibitors have been designed. One method of miRNA inhibition has been the use of modified nucleic acids that can
bind and inhibit the mature miRNAs.99 An example of this is
the anti-miR which can have various chemical modifications
that enhance function and increase stability such as locked
nucleic acids (LNAs),99e101 peptic nucleic acids, phosphorothioate modifications, 20 O-Me and 20 -fluoro substitutions
and morpholinos.59,99e105 Such miRNA inhibitors have been
tested successfully in multiple experiments and are
currently being evaluated for clinical purposes.101,105 In
contrast, nude miRNA mimics can be packaged directly with
delivery vehicles for therapy.106
Another active area with miRNA research has been the
delivery of miRNA inhibitors or miRNA mimics to target host
regions. One effective method is the use of engineered viruses that induce miRNA inhibition through the expression

58

Figure 2 MicroRNAs and cancer therapy. There are multiple ways which microRNAs can be affected by drug therapy. Drugs can
either through the cell membrane or bind to receptors or cellular channels (A) to enter the cell. Once inside drugs can bind to
protein targets or transcription factors (B) to affect miRNA expression (C) or conversely block the activation of protein targets and
prevent that target from activating or blocking a miRNA. By driving miRNA expression this can now lead to inhibition of oncogenes
(D) or tumor suppressors (E). Furthermore, miRNAs could potentially regulate each other (F) meaning drugs can have multiple
effects on miRNAs. Another possibility is that the drug can directly bind to the regulatory region of miRNAs either inhibiting or
inducing expression (G), which can then lead to decrease of miRNA-target genes. Drugs can also potentially bind to miRNAs
themselves or to miRNA binding partners (H) leading to a change in miRNA function. Finally miRNAs themselves can be drugs either
as modified nucleic acids or as oligos or antisense oligos and then packaged into either viruses or microvesicles and macrovesicles.
These miRNAs can enter the cell freely to inhibit downstream targets or potentially bind to cellular receptors (I). Thus, by changing
miRNA expression it could change the ability of a cell to respond to drugs either by activating resistance or bestowing sensitivity
through a multitude of mechanisms. These are some of the most common mechanisms that miRNAs can be affect by drugs or act as
a drug themselves.

of transcripts complementary to mature miRNA sequences.
These viral delivery methods have had significant success in
laboratory studies but have limited effectiveness in patients due to concerns about off-target effects of the viruses such as immunogenicity and chromosomal
incorporations.107 Another limitation is the inability to
specifically target the virus to the tumor and thereby
generating toxicity as several of these miRNAs control host
processes important for issues outside of the tumor.107e109
Another mechanism for the delivery of miRNA-based therapies is the use of nanoparticles.110,111 The nanoparticle
delivery method appears attractive because it avoids
several of the concerns used for viral delivery systems.107
The nanoparticle delivery method has been shown to hold
great potential. For example, Su et al found that lipid
nanoparticles that contained 20 fluoro-modified anti-miR122 significantly inhibited tumor growth.110 Another
method recently developed was the use of biodegradable
polymer nanoparticles containing anti-miRNAs to inhibit
miR-155 in a mouse model of pre-B-cell lymphoma.111
Nanoparticles conjugated with targeting molecules for
specific binding have also been designed and tested. For
example, Huang et al designed transferring-conjugated

anionic lipopolyplex nanoparticles carrying miR-29b and
showed their specific binding to AML cells and significant
anti-leukemia activities in vitro and in vivo.106

MiRNAs as biomarkers for diagnosis and
prognosis in cancers
Currently, there are dozens of clinical trials that are
assessing the correlation between miRNA expression and
cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Several of these trials have
been started in the past five years (www.clinicaltrials.gov)
while new ones are being designed. Due to the pleiotropic
effects of miRNAs they have been an attractive avenue for
patient diagnosis evaluation and prognosis. Also, miRNAs,
attributed to their size, are highly stable and resistant to
RNAses and thus have a higher level of stability than mRNA.

MiRNAs in cancer tissues
Expression profiles of many miRNAs derived from tumor
tissues have been shown to be useful in diagnosis and
prognosis
of
the
patients.
For
example,
Lu

MicroRNAs in Cancer
et al demonstrated that miRNA expression profiles can be
used to precisely classify various types of cancers, and are
superior to mRNA expression profiles in classification of
poorly differentiated tumors.15 MiR-181 family has been
shown to provide an independent prognostic assessment in
both cytogenetically normal and abnormal acute myeloid
leukemia patients.31,32,112,113 Similarly, a study from Yang
et al showed that seven miRNAs, miR-15b*, miR-23a, miR133a, miR-150*, miR-197, miR-497 and miR-548b-5p, were
significantly decreased in the serum of patients with
advanced stage (grade IIeIV) astrocytomas, and the miRNAbased signature could accurately distinguish between
normal vs. cancer patients.114

Circulating MiRNAs in serum or plasma
Furthermore, several studies have identified stable miRNAs
in human serum or plasma and have seen that there are
distinctive patterns of expression of these miRNAs in these
patients.56,57,115e121 Circulating miRNAs have also been
shown to be able to serve as diagnostic/prognostic indicators. For example, Chen et al identified a comprehensive miRNA signature in the serum of normal patients
comprising roughly 190 miRNAs; they further demonstrated
that cancer patients with solid malignancies had a
completely different miRNA expression signature.122 Differential expression of circulating miRNAs has since been
seen in patients of many types of cancers in the past several
years including multiple myeloma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, colon
cancer, pancreatic cancer, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,
squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and
several others48,50,123e161 (reviewed further in Ref.149).

New function of MiRNAs other than targeting
mRNAs
Increasing evidence shows that both normal and tumor cells
(especially circulating tumor cells (CTCs)162,163 in terms of
solid tumors) can package miRNAs in exosomes (10e100 nm
in diameter), microvesicles (100e1000 nm), membrane
microparticles (50e80 nm) and apoptotic bodies
(50e500 nm) which appear to be specifically-packaged
miRNAs.164 These miRNAs can control functions in both
closely neighboring cells and distantly located cells. This
provides a solid basis to study miRNAs in CTCs and in
extracellular vesicles. Further, with new research it has
been discovered that miRNAs can bind to proteins, challenging the current dogma of miRNAs acting solely on target
mRNAs.165 Thus, miRNAs packed in these extracellular
vesicles can have diverse effects outside of mRNA binding.
This thought was very recently supported when it was
discovered that miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-29a) within exosomes can bind to toll-like receptors (TLRs) and could
activate immune cells as ligands for these receptors.165
Although this might have been hypothesized with previous
knowledge that single viral RNAs can be ligands for these
receptors,166,167 these findings have never been shown
before in miRNAs and open up an entirely undiscovered and
novel field looking at the function of miRNAs as ligands.
Additionally, this could mean that miRNAs could be

59
potential ligands for the large class of orphan receptors
where no ligand has been identified to date168,169 or they
could be ligands for a myriad of other receptors.

Conclusions
As we look at the last decade of miRNA research in cancer
biology and the incredible work that has been accomplished, it is clear that there is still much to be discovered.
The future work in the next ten years will be focused on
understanding how miRNAs regulate target genes in cancer
initiation, progression, metastasis, relapse, and drug
response and resistance, which will provide a more
comprehensive mechanistic analysis of these noncoding
RNAs. Furthermore, more noncoding RNAs are constantly
being studied and are also an increasing area of focus.
Future work will undoubtedly focus on the co-interaction
and regulation of noncoding RNAs and how they together
contribute to disease. Once we have gained this understanding, it will allow researchers to design better miRNA
inhibitors or miRNA mimics that will guide the creation of
new and more effective drug therapies. However, there are
still lots of challenges to be solved before we applied
miRNA-based therapies into the clinic to treat cancer
patients.
