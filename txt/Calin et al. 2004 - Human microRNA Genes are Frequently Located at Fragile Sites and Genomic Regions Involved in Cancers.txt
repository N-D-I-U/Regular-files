A large number of tiny noncoding RNAs have been cloned and
named microRNAs (miRs). Recently, we have reported that miR-15a
and miR-16a, located at 13q14, are frequently deleted and兾or
down-regulated in patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a disorder characterized by increased survival. To further
investigate the possible involvement of miRs in human cancers on
a genome-wide basis, we have mapped 186 miRs and compared
their location to the location of previous reported nonrandom
genetic alterations. Here, we show that miR genes are frequently
located at fragile sites, as well as in minimal regions of loss of
heterozygosity, minimal regions of amplification (minimal amplicons), or common breakpoint regions. Overall, 98 of 186 (52.5%) of
miR genes are in cancer-associated genomic regions or in fragile
sites. Moreover, by Northern blotting, we have shown that several
miRs located in deleted regions have low levels of expression in
cancer samples. These data provide a catalog of miR genes that
may have roles in cancer and argue that the full complement of
miRs in a genome may be extensively involved in cancers.

expression analysis shows that miR-15a and miR-16a are located
within a 30-kb region of loss in CLL and that both genes are
deleted or down-regulated in the majority (⬇68%) of CLL cases
(9). Hemizygous and兾or homozygous loss at 13q14 occur in more
than half of cases and constitute the most frequent chromosomal
abnormality in CLL (10). Chromosome 13q14 deletions also
occur in ⬇ 50% of mantle cell lymphoma, in 16–40% of multiple
myeloma, and in 60% of prostate cancers, suggesting that one or
more tumor suppressor (TS) genes at 13q14 are involved in the
pathogenesis of these human tumors (10). However, detailed
genetic analysis, including extensive loss of heterozygosity
(LOH), mutation, and expression studies have failed to demonstrate the consistent involvement of any of the genes located in
the deleted region (9). Here, we present a systematic search for
the identification of possible correlations between the genomic
position of a large number of miRs and the location of cancerassociated genomic regions.

GENETICS

aturally occurring microRNAs (miRs) are 19- to 25-nt
transcripts cleaved from 70- to 100-nt hairpin precursors,
and are encoded in the genomes of invertebrates, vertebrates and
plants (1, 2). Many miRs are conserved in sequence between
distantly related organisms, suggesting that these molecules
participate in essential processes (3). The biological functions of
miRs are not yet fully understood. Several groups have uncovered roles for miRs in the coordination of cell proliferation and
cell death during development, and in stress resistance and fat
metabolism (4). For example, in Drosophila, miR-14 suppresses
cell death and is required for normal fat metabolism (5), whereas
bantam encodes a developmentally regulated miR that controls
cell proliferation and regulates the proapoptotic gene hid (6). It
is believed that miRs could direct positive or negative regulation
at a variety of levels, depending on the specific miR and target
base pair interaction and the cofactors that recognize them. lin-4
and let-7 are two members of the miR family known as small
temporally regulated RNA, because regulate timing of gene
expression during development of the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans. Both act as repressors of their respective target genes,
lin-14, lin-28, and lin-41, containing 3⬘ UTRs with sites complementary to the ⬇22-nt RNAs (7). Whereas perfect complementarity with targets was found in plants, in animals, the identification of putative targets is much more complicated, because
bulges and loops are not only tolerated, but seem to be the rule.
Despite the overall imperfect complementarity, a large subset of
Drosophila miRs were shown to be precisely complementary to
the K box, Brd box, and GY box motifs in the 3⬘ UTR, motifs
found to significantly affect both transcript stability and translational efficiency (8).
At present time there are several indications that miRs might
be a new class of genes involved in human tumorigenesis. We
previously reported that miR-15a and miR-16a are located at
chromosome 13q14, a region deleted in more than half of B cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLLs). Detailed deletion and

Fragile Site (FRA) Database. We constructed this database by using
Virtual Gene Nomenclature Workshop at www.gene.ucl.ac.uk兾
nomenclature兾workshop. For each FRA locus, the literature was
screened for papers reporting the cloning. In 10 cases, we found
genomic positions for both centromeric and telomeric ends. The
total genomic length of these FRA loci was 26.9 Mb. In 29 cases,
we were able to identify only one anchoring marker, and we
considered, based on the published data, that 3 Mb can be used
as the median length for each FRA locus and therefore, we
considered for these sites as very close miR located inside this
‘‘window’’ length. The human clones for 17 HPV16 integration
sites were precisely mapped on the human genome. We considered by analogy with the length of a FRA that a distance of ⬍2
Mb could define ‘‘close’’ vicinity.
PubMed Database. First, PubMed was screened for papers de-

scribing cancer-related abnormalities such as minimal regions of
LOH and minimal regions of amplification (minimal amplicons)
by using the words ‘‘LOH and genome-wide,’’ ‘‘amplification and
genome-wide,’’ and ‘‘amplicon and cancer.’’ The data obtained
from 32 papers were used as a screening for the identification of
putative cancer-associated genomic regions (CAGRs), based on
markers with high frequency of LOH兾amplification. As a second
step, a literature search was performed to determine the presence or absence of the above three types of alterations and to
determine the precise location of miRs in respect with the
CAGR (for a detailed list of reference papers see Supporting
References, which is published as supporting information on the
PNAS web site). We used as searching words, the combinations
‘‘minimal regions of LOH and cancer,’’ and ‘‘minimal region
amplification and cancer.’’ We have found a total of 296 papers
that were manually curated to find regions defined by both
telomeric and centromeric markers. We were able to identify 154
minimally deleted regions (median length 4.14 Mb) and 37
minimally amplified regions (median length 2.45 Mb) with
precise genomic mapping for both telomeric and centromeric
ends involving all human chromosomes except Y. To identify
common breakpoints regions we searched PubMed with the
combination ‘‘translocation and cloning and breakpoint and
cancer,’’ and we found 308 papers that were manually curated to
find a set of 45 translocations with at least one breakpoint
precisely mapped.

Statistical Analysis. To test hypotheses related to the incidence of
miRs and association with chromosome, FRAs, amplified regions in cancer, deletion regions in cancer, we used random
effect Poisson regression models. Under these models, ‘‘events’’
were defined as the number of miRs, and nonoverlapping lengths
of the region of interest defined exposure ‘‘time’’ (i.e., FRA
versus non-FRA, etc.). The ‘‘length’’ of a region was exactly ⫾
1 Mb, if known, or estimated as ⫾ 1 Mb if unknown. The random
effect used was chromosome, in that data within a chromosome
were assumed correlated. The fixed effect in each model consisted of an indicator variable(s) for the type of region. We report
the incidence rate ratio (IRR), two-sided 95% confidence interval of the IRR, and two-sided P values for testing the
hypothesis that the IRR is 1.0. An IRR significantly ⬎1 indicates
an increase in the number of miRs within a region. Each model
was repeated considering the distribution of miRs only in the
transcriptional active portion of the genome (⬇43%, using the
published data), rather than the entire chromosome length, with
similar results obtained (data not shown). This second model is
more conservative and takes into account the phenomenon of
clustering that was observed for the miRs genomic location. All
computations were completed by using STATA V7.0.
Patient Samples and Cell Lines. Patient samples were obtained after

informed consent from 12 patients diagnosed with CLL and

processed as described (9). We used also seven human lung
cancer cell lines: Calu-3, H1299, H522, H460, H23, H1650, and
H1573. The cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection and maintained according to American Type
Culture Collection instructions. As normal control, we used
normal lung total RNA purchased from Clontech.
Northern Blotting. Total RNA isolation and the blotting were
performed as described (9). Blots were stripped by boiling in
0.1% aqueous SDS兾0.1 ⫻ SSC for 10 min, and were reprobed.
As loading control we used 5S rRNA stained with ethidium
bromide.

Results
The miRs Are Nonrandomly Distributed in the Human Genome. The

present lack of knowledge about the function of miRs highlights
the importance of knowing the genomic distribution of miR
genes. Frequently, the chromosomal positions of genes have led
to important insights into the roles of genes in specific diseases.
Therefore, we mapped 186 genes representing known or predicted miRs based on mouse homology or computational methods (refs. 11–18; for more details, see Methods and Table 3). This
set of 186 genes is representative of the full human complement
of miRs in a genome: experimental and bioinformatics approaches established that the number of miRs is between 188 and
255 (11). The distribution of these genes is nonrandom. Ninety
miR genes are located in 36 clusters, usually with two or three
genes per cluster (median ⫽ 2.5). The largest cluster is composed
of six genes at 13q31 (miR-17兾miR-18兾miR-19a兾miR-20兾miR19b1兾miR-92–1; see Table 3). We have found a significant
association of the incidence of miRs and particular chromosomes: chromosome 4 has a less than expected rate of miRs
(IRR ⫽ 0.27, P ⫽ 0.035), and chromosomes 17 and 19 contain
significantly more miR genes than expected, based on chromosome size (IRR ⫽ 2.97, P ⫽ 0.002 and IRR ⫽ 3.39, P ⫽ 0.001,
respectively). The same results were obtained by using two
different models, one considering the random distribution of
miRs over the entire chromosome, and the other considering the
distribution of miRs only in the transcriptional active portion of
the genome (⬇43%, using the published, for more details see
Methods, and Table 4, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). Six of the 36 clusters (17%)
containing 16 of 90 clustered genes (18%) are located on these
two small chromosomes, which account for only 5% of the entire
genome.
A Significant Number of miRs Are Located in FRAs or Are Close to
Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Integration Sites. Furthermore, 35 of

186 miRs (19%) are located in (13 miRs) or very close (⬍3Mb;
22 miRs) to cloned FRAs. We used a set of 39 FRAs with
available cloning information, for 10 of which we were able to
find data about the exact dimension (mean 2.69 Mb) and position
(for detailed information, see Methods). The relative incidence
of miRs inside FRAs occurred at a rate 9.12 times higher than
in non-FRAs (P ⬍ 0.001, using random effect Poisson regression
models, for detailed information see Methods, Table 1, and Table
4). The same very high statistical significance was also found if
we considered only the 13 miRs located exactly inside FRAs or
exactly in the vicinity of the ‘‘anchoring’’ marker mapped for an
FRA (IRR ⫽ 3.22, P ⬍ 0.001). Interestingly, among the four
most active common FRAs, FRA3B, FRA16D, FRA6E, and
FRA7H, we have found seven miRs in (miR-29a and miR-29b)
or close (miR-96, miR-182s, miR-182as, miR-183, and miR129–1) to FRA7H, the only FRA where no candidate TS gene
has been found. The other three sites contain known or candidate TS genes: FHIT, WWOX, and PARK2, respectively (19–21).
Much more, looking at 113 FRAs scattered in human karyotype
we found that 61 miRs are located in the same cytogenetic

Numerous CAGRs Contain miRs. If the miR-FRA-HPV16 associa-

tion has significance for cancer pathogenesis, miR genes might
be involved in malignancies through other mechanisms, such as
deletion, amplification, or epigenetic modifications. Thus, we
next searched extensively for reported genomic alterations in
human cancers, located in regions containing miRs. PubMed was
searched for reports of CAGRs: (i) minimal regions of LOH,
suggestive of the presence of TS genes; (ii) minimal regions of
amplification, suggestive of the presence of oncogenes (OGs);
and (iii) common breakpoint regions in or near possible OGs or
TS genes (for detailed information see Methods). Overall, 98 of
186 (52.5%) miR genes are in CAGRs (Table 2, and Table 6,
which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web
site), including 80 miRs (43%), that are located exactly in
minimal regions of LOH or minimal regions of amplification

positions with FRAs (Fig. 1). This result allows us to speculate
that more miRs are located in兾near FRA and our results
represent an underestimation only because the mapping of these
unstable regions is not complete. A substantial body of evidence
supports the proposal that at least some common chromosomal
FRAs predispose to DNA instability in cancer cells (22, 23).
Indeed, FRAs are preferential sites of sister chromatid exchange, translocation, deletion, amplification, or integration of
plasmid DNA and tumor-associated viruses such as HPV.
Infection with HPV16 or 18 is the major risk factor for
developing cervical cancer, and common FRAs are preferential
targets for HPV16 integrations in cervical tumors (24, 25). To
understand the significance of miR-FRA correlation, we looked
for association between miR gene locations and HPV16 inte-

gration site in cervical tumors. Thirteen miR genes (7%) are
located near (⬍2.5 Mb) 7 of 17 (45%) cloned integration sites.
The relative incidence of miRs at HPV16 integration sites
occurred at a rate 3.22 times higher than in the rest of the
genome (P ⬍ 0.002; Tables 1 and 3, and Table 5, which is
published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). In
one cluster of integration sites at chromosome 17q23, with three
HPV16 integration events spread over ⬇4 Mb of genomic
sequence, we found four miR genes (miR-21, miR-301, miR-142s,
and miR-142as). Because HPV integration into the host cell
genome can cause large deletions, amplification, or complex
rearrangements, the expression of cellular genes at or near
integration sites may be affected. MiR genes located near the
integration sites are possible targets of such genome alterations.

chromosomal band as the FRA are red. We were able to precisely locate 35 miRs inside 12 cloned FRAs. The red arrow shows frequently observed FRAs.

described in a variety of tumors as lung, breast, ovarian, colon,
gastric, and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as leukemias and
lymphomas (Tables 2 and 6).
Several interesting results came out from this analysis (Table
2). First, on chromosome 9, eight of 15 mapped miRs (including
six located in clusters), are inside two regions of deletion on 9q
(26): the clusters let-7a-1兾let-7f-1兾let-7d and miR-23b兾miR-27b兾
miR-24–1 inside the region B at 9q22.3 and miR-181a and
miR-199b inside region D at 9q33–34.1. Furthermore, five other
miRs are located near (⬍2 Mb) to the markers with the highest
rate of LOH: miR-31 near IFNA, miR-204 near D9S15, miR-181
and miR-147 near GSN, and miR-123 near D9S67. Second, in
breast carcinomas, two different regions of loss at 11q23, independent from ATM locus have been studied extensively: the first
spans ⬇2 Mb between loci D11S1347–D11S927, the second is
located between loci D11S1345–D11S1316, and is estimated at
⬇1 Mb (27). Candidate TS genes were not found is spite of
extensive effort, except the PPP2R1B gene, involved in ⬍10% of
cases (9, 28). Both minimal LOH regions contain numerous
miRs: the cluster miR-34-a1兾miR-34-a2 in the first and the
cluster miR-125b1兾let-7a-2兾miR-100 in the second. Third, high
frequency of LOH at 17p13.3 and relatively low frequency of
TP53 mutation in cases of hepatocellular carcinomas, lung
cancers, and astrocytomas indicate the presence of other TS
genes involved in the development of these tumors. We have
found that one minimal LOH region described in hepatocellular
carcinoma and located telomeric to TP53 between markers
D17S1866 and D17S1574 harbor three miRs: miR-22, miR-132,
and miR-212 (29), whereas between ENO3 and TP53, we found
miR-195 (30). Fourth, homozygous deletions (HDs) in cancer
suggest the presence of TS genes (31) and several miR genes are
located in homozygously deleted regions without known TS
genes. In addition to miR-15a and miR-16a located at 13q14 HD
region in B-CLL, the cluster miR-99a兾let-7c兾miR-125b-2
mapped in a 21p11.1 region of HD in lung cancers and miR-32
at 9q31.2 in a region of HD in various types of cancer. Among
the seven regions of LOH and HD on the short arm of
chromosome 3, three of them harbor miRs: miR-26a in region
AP20, miR-138–1 in region 5 at 3p21.3 and the cluster let-7g兾
3002 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0307323101

miR-135–1 in region 3 at 3p21.1-p21.2 (32). These locations are
very unlikely to be random: overall, we have found that the
relative incidence of miRs in both deleted and amplified regions
is highly significant (IRR ⫽ 4.08, P ⬍ 0.001 and IRR ⫽ 3.97, P ⬍
0.001, respectively; Table 1). Thus, these miRs expand the
spectrum of candidate TS genes.
To test whether the genomic location in deleted regions
influence the miR expression, we have analyzed a panel of
B-CLL samples with known deletions at 13q14 and a set of lung
cancer cell lines. Mir-16a expression (located at 13q14) was low
or absent in the majority of B-CLL cases although the expression
of miR-26a (at 3p21) and miR-99a (at 21q11.2), both regions not
involved in B-CLL, was at relatively equal levels in all cases. By
contrast, both miR-26a and miR-99a are not expressed or
expressed at low levels in lung cancer cell lines, and this finding
correlates with their location in regions of LOH兾HD in lung
tumors兾cell lines. On the contrary, the expression of miR-16a
was the same in the majority of cell lines as in normal lung
(Fig. 2).
Several miR genes are located near breakpoint regions, including miR-142s at 50 nucleotides from the t(8, 17) break

human cancers. Class I HOX genes include the Hox genes,
whereas class II include Hox-related genes with the conserved
HOX domain but less-defined functions. We tested the hypotheses that miR genes would be found within class II Hox gene
clusters as well. Thus, we analyzed 14 other human HOX gene
clusters (38) and found that seven miRs (miR-129–1, miR-153–2,
let-7a-1, let-7f-1, let-7d, miR-202, and miR-139) are located close
(⬍0.5 Mb) to class II homeotic genes, a result which highly
improbably occurs by chance (IRR ⫽ 2.95, P ⬍ 0.001; Table 1
and data not shown). These data strongly support a suggested
role of miR genes in development and give hints for possible
targets for miRs regulatory effects.

miR gene located in the same position. Other miR genes are
located relatively close to breakpoints, for example, the cluster
miR 34a-1兾34a-2 and miR-153–2 (see Table 6). Another example
is the woodchuck homolog of human miR-122a. BLAST data
showed the homologue in sense orientation with the ORF of hcr
gene from woodchuck, a noncoding gene involved in a rearrangement with c-myc in a woodchuck hepatocellular carcinoma
(33). Further supporting the suggested role of miR-122a in
cancer, we found that the human miR-122a is located in the
minimal amplicon around MALT1 in aggressive marginal zone
lymphoma and ⬇160 kb from the breakpoint region of translocation t (11, 18) in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma
(34). Apart from miR-122a, several other miR genes are located
in regions particularly prone to cancer-specific abnormalities,
such as miR-142s and miR-142as at 17q23 close to a t(8, 17)
breakpoint in B cell acute leukemia, and also within the minimal
amplicon in breast cancer and near the FRA17B site, a target for
HPV16 integration in cervical tumors (see Table 6 and Fig. 3).

Discussion
The data of our systematic analysis argue that the full complement of miRs in a genome may be extensively involved in
cancers. Recently, it was reported that miR-143 and miR-145
consistently display reduced steady-state levels of the mature
miR at the adenomatous and cancer stages of colorectal neoplasia (39). Other examples of miR genes located in sites shown
to be involved in human cancers are: miR-142s located at the
breakpoint junction of a t(8, 17) translocation, which causes an
aggressive B cell leukemia due to up-regulation of a translocated
c-MYC gene (16, 40); miR-155 excised from a noncoding RNA,
BIC, identified as a gene transcriptionally activated in B cell
lymphomas induced by avian leukemia virus, as a consequence
of promoter insertion at a common retroviral integration site
(41); miR-7–1 in the last intron of the heterogenous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein K gene, a gene overexpressed in cancer cells
(16, 42, 43). The miR precursor processing reaction requires
Dicer RNase III and Argonaute family members (44). Argonaute has been shown to interact both genetically and biochemically with miRs (15). Further stressing the importance of miRs
in cancer, it was shown that mutations in genes required for miRs
biosynthesis cause developmental defects and cancer (45, 46). A
speculative model was drawn where miRs could be contributors
for oncogenesis working as classical TS genes (as is the case of
miR-15a兾miR-16a) or as classical OGs (as is the case of miR155), whereas some miRs could participate in ‘‘posttranscriptional collapse,’’ a scenario where misexpression of a miR causes
a posttranscriptional misregulation of a TSG or OG (47).
Perhaps surprisingly, specific miR genes (such as miR-33b) are
in regions involved in both deletions and amplification depending of cancer type. However, the same gene can behave as an OG
or suppressor gene, depending on the type of alteration, cell

Analysis of the genomic location of miR genes provides interesting clues for possible functions. We have found a strong
correlation between the location of specific miRs and HOX
genes. The miR-10a and miR-196–1 are located within the HOX
B cluster on 17q21, whereas miR-196–2 is within the HOX C
cluster at 12q13, and miR-10b maps to the HOX D cluster at 2q31.
Moreover, three other miRs (miR-148, miR-152, and miR-148b)
are close [⬍1 Mb; we select this distance because some form of
long-range coordinated regulation of gene expression was shown
to expand up to 1 Mb (35)] to HOX clusters (Fig. 4). Such
proximity is unlike to have occurred by chance (IRR ⫽ 15.77;
P ⬍ 0.001; Table 1). HOX-containing genes are a family of
encoding transcription factor genes that play crucial roles during
normal development and in oncogenesis. HOXB4, HOXB5,
HOXC9, HOXC10, HOXD4, and HOXD8, all with miR neighbors, are deregulated in a variety of solid and hematopoietic
cancers (36, 37). Because collinear expression of and cooperation between HOX genes is well demonstrated, these data
suggest that miRs may be altered along with the HOX genes in
Calin et al.

type, or transcriptional兾posttranscriptional events (48). For example, it was shown that within the superfamily of Ras OGs,
Kras2 could inhibit lung carcinogenesis in mice, illustrating a TS
role of this gene in lung tumorigenesis (49). In Fig. 3 we present
a model of possible mechanisms explaining the miR involvement
in cancers. We propose that miRs can act both as TS genes and
OGs. MiRs are participating in normal cells homeostasy by
interfering with mRNA translation and兾or stability. Because of
the small size, the accumulation of loss-of-function or gain-offunction point mutations may be rare events. HDs (as is the case
for miR-15a兾miR-16a cluster or probably miR-26a), the combination mutation plus promoter hypermethylation or gene amplification seems to be the main mechanisms of inactivation or
activation, respectively. MiRs activity can be influenced either by
the reposition of other genes close to miRs promoters兾
regulatory regions (as is the case of miR-142s ⫺ c-myc translocation) or by the relocalization of an miR near other regulatory
elements. The overall effects in the case of miRs inactivation is
the overexpression of yet unidentified target miRs, whereas the

miRs activation will lead to down-regulation of target miRs,
supposed to participate in apoptosis, cell cycle, invasivity, or
angiogenesis.
In conclusion, our data represent a genome-wide systematic
search for correlations between the genomic positions of miR
genes and specific cancer-associated abnormalities, and provide
a catalog of such data for each miR gene. In the absence of
powerful bioinformatic tools for finding miR targets, genomic
proximity may be very useful to screen for such interactions.
