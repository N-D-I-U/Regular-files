Background: Role of microRNAs in angiotensin II-mediated vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction is unclear.
Results: Angiotensin II up-regulates miR-132 in VSMC. miR-132 induces MCP-1 partly via targeting PTEN, activates CREB,
and regulates genes related to cell-cycle and motility.
Conclusion: miR-132/212 is a novel modulator of Ang II actions.
Significance: miRNAs may serve as new drug targets for Ang II-mediated cardiovascular diseases.
Angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated vascular smooth muscle cell
dysfunction plays a critical role in cardiovascular diseases. However, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in this process is unclear.
We used small RNA deep sequencing to profile Ang II-regulated
miRNAs in rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and evaluated their role in VSMC dysfunction. Sequencing results
revealed several Ang II-responsive miRNAs, and bioinformatics
analysis showed that their predicted targets can modulate biological processes relevant to cardiovascular diseases. Further
studies with the most highly induced miR-132 and miR-212
cluster (miR-132/212) showed time- and dose-dependent upregulation of miR-132/212 by Ang II through the Ang II Type 1
receptor. We identified phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN) as a novel target of miR-132 and demonstrated that
miR-132 induces monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 at
least in part via PTEN repression in rat VSMC. Moreover,
miR-132 overexpression enhanced cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation via RASA1
(p120 Ras GTPase-activating protein 1) down-regulation,
whereas miR-132 inhibition attenuated Ang II-induced
CREB activation. Furthermore, miR-132 up-regulation by
Ang II required CREB activation, demonstrating a positive
feedback loop. Notably, aortas from Ang II-infused mice displayed similar up-regulation of miR-132/212 and monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1, supporting in vivo relevance. In
addition, microarray analysis and reverse transcriptasequantitative PCR validation revealed additional novel miR132 targets among Ang II-down-regulated genes implicated
in cell cycle, motility, and cardiovascular functions. These

results suggest that miR132/212 can serve as a novel cellular
node to fine-tune and amplify Ang II actions in VSMC.

Angiotensin II (Ang II)2 exerts various pathophysiological
effects in the vessel wall, leading to not only vasoconstriction
and hemodynamic effects but also proinflammatory, growthpromoting, and vascular remodeling events (1–3). Ang II activates vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in the vessel wall
and induces VSMC proliferation and hypertrophy (4, 5), key
functions associated with hypertension, restenosis, and atherosclerosis (6). Moreover, Ang II induces the expression of cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) (7, 8), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (9) in VSMC and osteopontin (10)
in the arterial wall, key players involved in monocyte recruitment, neointimal formation, and atherosclerosis (2, 11).
The role of Ang II-mediated VSMC dysfunction in the
pathogenesis of hypertension and atherosclerosis has been
extensively studied in cultured VSMC and in vivo models.
These diverse effects of Ang II are mostly mediated by the Ang
II type 1 receptor (AT1R), leading to the activation of several
key signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPKs) (3) and transcription factors NF-␬B (7) and
cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) (6). Ang II
activates CREB through phosphorylation at the Ser-133 residue
in a MAPK-dependent manner, and this is functionally associated with VSMC hypertrophy and inflammation (7, 8). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in Ang II-mediated
VSMC dysfunction remain incompletely understood.
Growing evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play
critical roles in cardiovascular development and disorders (12).

Ang II-induced miR-132 in VSMC
miRNAs are non-coding RNA molecules 20⬃22 nucleotides in
length that can negatively regulate gene expression and affect
diverse biological processes. Typically, the seed sequences of
mammalian miRNAs base pair with binding sites in the 3⬘-untranslated region (3⬘-UTR) of target mRNAs, leading to translational inhibition and/or mRNA degradation of these target
genes (13). miRNA biogenesis and maturation begins with transcription of pri-miRNA by RNA polymerase II or III followed by
pri-miRNA nuclear cleavage to generate pre-miRNA, which is
transported to the cytoplasm and further processed by the
RNase Dicer to form mature miRNA. Then these miRNAs are
incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex and
interact with target mRNAs to fine-tune gene regulation under
diverse pathophysiological conditions (13). Recent studies with
VSMC have identified functional roles for various miRNAs
such as miR-143 and miR-145 which regulate VSMC differentiation (14), contractility, and Ang II-induced hypertension
(15), miR-21 (16) and miR-31 (17) that regulate VSMC proliferation, and miR-125b that promotes proinflammatory
responses in VSMC under diabetic conditions (18). However,
the role of miRNAs in Ang II-mediated VSMC dysfunction has
not yet been investigated.
In this study we utilized the recent technology of small RNA
deep sequencing (smRNA-Seq) to profile Ang II-regulated
miRNAs in rat VSMC (RVSMC) and also examined their functional relevance. We observed that Ang II increased the expression of miR-132 and miR-212 cluster (miR-132/212) in RVSMC
in vitro and in aortas of Ang II-infused mice in vivo. We demonstrated that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a
novel target of miR-132 and that miR-132/212 play key roles in
Ang II-induced MCP-1 gene expression in RVSMC. Furthermore, we uncovered a positive feedback loop mechanism
between Ang II-induced CREB activation and miR-132 expression in RVSMC. In addition, we observed that the predicted
targets of miR-132 that were also down-regulated by Ang II
have biological functions related to cell cycle, cell motility, and
cardiovascular diseases.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Culture—All animal studies were performed according
to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved
protocols. RVSMC were isolated from thoracic aortas of male
Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River) by enzymatic digestion (8)
and cultured in M199 medium supplemented with 10% FBS
and antibiotics. FACS analysis showed 99.2% cells stained positive for smooth muscle cell specific marker ␣-actin (data not
shown). RVSMC were serum-depleted for 48 h in M199
medium supplemented with 0.2% BSA before Ang II stimulation unless mentioned otherwise.
smRNA-Seq—Total RNA was used for the construction of
small RNA libraries, cluster generation, and then deep sequencing (at the Beckman Research Institute Sequencing Core) using
the Alternative v1.5 Protocol (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA)
with minor optimization. Briefly, 0.5 ␮g of total RNA was
ligated to sRNA 3⬘adapter (AUCUCGUAUGCCGUCUUCUGCUUG) using T4 RNA Ligase 2, truncated (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) at 22 °C for 1 h, and subsequently ligated to
the SRA 5⬘adapter (GUUCAGAGUUCUACAGUCCGACMAY 4, 2012 • VOLUME 287 • NUMBER 19

GAUC) with T4 RNA ligase (New England BioLabs, Ipswich,
MA) at 20 °C for 1 h. The adaptor-linked RNA was converted to
single-stranded cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and RT-Primer (5⬘-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA-3⬘) and then amplified with Phusion DNA
Polymerase (Finnzymes Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) for
12 cycles using primers (5⬘-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA-3⬘; 5⬘-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGA-3⬘). PAGE purification was carried
out to select small RNAs of 17–52 nucleotides in length. The
purified library was quantified using quantitative PCR (qPCR),
used for cluster generation on cBot, and sequenced using
Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina).
Data Analysis of smRNA-Seq—SmRNA-Seq data were analyzed as described earlier (18) with some modifications. Raw
data in FASTQ format generated from the Illumina pipeline
was aligned against Rat Nov. 2004 (rn4) assembly using
Novoalign software. The 3⬘-adapter sequence of the raw reads
was first trimmed by Novoalign, and reads with 16 or more
bases were aligned to rat genome. For reads aligned to multiple
locations on the genome, one aligned region was randomly
selected for counting the number of reads (supplemental Table
S1) as described (19). Genomic locus of each rat mature miRNA
was generated by aligning rat mature miRNA sequences
(miRBase v14) to rn4 assembly without allowing mismatches.
Repetitive regions were not filtered out. For each sample, an
aligned read was annotated to a specific genome feature in the
order of mature miRNA, miRNA precursor, rRNA, tRNA,
other non-coding RNA, Refseq gene, and intergenic region if it
completely fell in the specified region with a 10-bp extension on
both ends. Specifically, aligned reads were first annotated to rat
mature miRNA (v14, miRbase) genomic loci. The reads that
could not be annotated to mature miRNA regions were processed further to annotated pre-miRNA genomic regions (v14).
Remaining reads were then annotated to non-coding RNAs
other than miRNAs including rRNA and tRNA using a rat noncoding RNA annotation file downloaded from UCSC genome
browser. Finally, the reads that were not annotated to any noncoding RNA regions were assigned to Refseq genes, and the
remaining reads were defined as intergenic regions. For each
sample, the reads corresponding to the mature miRNA
genomic loci (including 10-base extension on both ends) were
counted to obtain expression levels of total miRNAs (supplemental Table S2). The resulting miRNA expression dataset was
further normalized by scaling the total mature miRNA counts
in each sample to 8.5 million. Differentially expressed miRNAs
induced by Ang II at the indicated time points were selected
using the following criteria; (a) reads in at least one sample were
above 256 and (b) showed at least a 1.5-fold change between
Ang II-treated samples versus untreated.
Cluster Analysis of Differentially Expressed miRNAs—In each
sample the raw read counts for each differentially expressed
miRNA was scaled by the total aligned miRNA reads and log2transformed. The transformed data were then mean-centered
and subjected to unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis
using Euclidean distance as dissimilarity metric and average
linkage.

Ang II-induced miR-132 in VSMC
Analysis of Potential Targets of Differentially Expressed
miRNAs—Potential targets of differentially expressed miRNAs
were identified using online bioinformatics tools TargetScan
Human 5.1 (20), miRanda (21), and Diana-microT V3.0 (22).
For each miRNA, only the targets that were predicted by at least
two tools and conserved across rat, mouse, and human were
selected. We pooled 2067 genes representing potential targets
of all the differentially regulated miRNAs. This pooled target
gene set was subsequently analyzed by DAVID v6.7 (david.
abcc.ncifcrf.gov) to obtain enriched biological processes and
Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) for potential pathways relevant to cardiovascular functions.
RNA Isolation and Gene Expression—RNA was extracted
using miRNeasy columns (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). Gene
expression analysis (miRNA and mRNA) was performed by
reverse transcriptase-qPCR using the miScript Reverse Transcription kit and SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) using primer
sequences listed in supplemental Table S3. In this method,
mature miRNAs present in RNA samples were first polyadenylated by poly(A) polymerase and then reverse-transcribed into
cDNA using oligo-dT primer with a universal tag. Subsequently, miRNAs were amplified using specific mature miRNA
sequences (designed by us or ordered from Qiagen) as forward
primers and the universal primer provided in the kit as the
reverse primer in the qPCR reaction. Expression levels of primiRNA of miR-132/212 were analyzed by Taqman pri-miRNA
assay (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).
Western Blotting—Preparation of protein lysates and Western blotting were performed as described earlier with some
modifications (8, 18). Antibodies against Ser-133-phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), total CREB, and PTEN were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The RASA1
antibody was purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis,
MN).
VSMC Transfection—Transfection of VSMC was performed
using Nucleofector II (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. RVSMC were trypsinized and
resuspended in Basic Nucleofecton Solution for mammalian
smooth muscle cells at 1 ⫻ 107 cells/ml. Next, 100 ␮l of cell
suspension (1 ⫻ 106 cells) was mixed with miRNA mimic, 2⬘-Omethyl-modified hairpin inhibitor oligonucleotides, ONTARGET plus siRNA (Dharmacon products, Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc., Waltham MA), or plasmids as indicated, and
electroporated in a Lonza-certified cuvette with Nucleofector II
device using the Nucleofector program D-33 optimized for
RVSMC (optimization data not shown). In some experiments
VSMC were transfected with plasmids expressing miR-132/
212-resistant PTEN (plasmid 10750, Addgene, Cambridge,
MA) (23) or RASA1 (24).
VSMC were also transfected using X-tremeGENE siRNA
Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) for luciferase
assays according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Transfected
cells were harvested for RNA, protein, and luciferase assays as
described (18) at the indicated times.
Transduction of VSMC with Lentiviruses—The lentiviral particles were generated in the Vector Laboratory at the Beckman
Research Institute. Briefly, HEK 293T cells at a density of 4 ⫻
106/10-cm culture dish were transfected with pCMV-G (con-

taining the VSV-G gene), pCgp (containing the HIV-1 gag and
pol genes), and pCMV-rev-2 (containing the rev gene) and precursor miRNA expression plasmid or miRNA inhibitor expression plasmid (Genecoepia, Rockville, MD) using calcium phosphate co-precipitation. Virus-containing supernatant was
harvested at 24 and 36 h after transfection, and the titer was
determined in HT1080 cells by flow cytometry analysis of
respective fluorescence markers (25). To transduce RVSMC
with lentiviral vectors expressing miRNA precursors and inhibitors, lentiviral particles were added to cells in the medium containing Polybrene (5 ␮g/ml), and medium was changed 24 h
later.
Construction of 3⬘-UTR Reporter Plasmids—3⬘-UTRs of
potential miR-132/212 targets were amplified from rat genomic
DNA using specific primers and cloned downstream of firefly
luciferase gene into ApaI and XbaI sites of pZeo/luc vector (26)
or XhoI and NotI sites of psiCHECK-2 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Cloned 3⬘-UTR fragments were verified by DNA
sequencing. The PTEN 3⬘-UTR region was amplified using
primers 5⬘-CTGCTCGAGCCTAGAGATTGATGATGCGTCCTCAG-3⬘ and 5⬘-GTAGCGGCCGCCAGGTAGGAGTCAACTCTGCCAAATAC-3⬘. RASA1 3⬘-UTR region was
amplified using primers 5⬘-CATTCTAGAGCACACCTTTCCACATTCCAGTGATG-3⬘ and 5⬘-CACGGGCCCATACCTTCCTTTATACCTCCCTTGGTG-3⬘.
Ang II Infusion—Male C57BL/6J mice (from The Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were implanted with Alzet
osmotic mini-pumps (Model 2004) filled with either PBS or
Ang II (2.5 ␮g/min/kg) for 2 weeks. At the end of the experiment, aortas were collected, and adventitia was carefully
removed before subsequent RNA extraction and gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR.
Affymetrix Gene Array Experiments and Data Analysis—Microarray hybridization and data acquisition were carried out by
the Functional Genomics and Bioinformatics Cores at the
Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope. Briefly, biotinylated cDNA derived from total RNA was hybridized with
Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0 ST arrays representing 27,342 well
characterized genes. Three independent biological replicates
were performed for each culture condition. Raw intensity data
in CEL file format were imported to Partek Genomics Suite
(Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO) and then preprocessed and normalized by Robust Multichip Average method. Differentially
expressed genes at different time points in RVSMC stimulated
with Ang II relative to control (untreated) were subsequently
identified using analysis of variance method in Partek.
Statistical Analysis—PRISM software (Graphpad, San Diego,
CA) was used for data analysis. All data shown are the means ⫾

RESULTS
Identification of Ang II-regulated miRNAs Using High
Throughput smRNA-Seq—Evidence shows that various
miRNAs play key roles in regulating VSMC differentiation and
proliferation, but the involvement of miRNAs in Ang II-mediated effects in VSMC is still largely unknown. To identify difVOLUME 287 • NUMBER 19 • MAY 4, 2012

Ang II-induced miR-132 in VSMC
ferentially expressed miRNAs in response to Ang II in cultured
RVSMC, we performed smRNA-Seq (22–30 nucleotide) with
small RNA libraries generated using total RNA extracted from
untreated (control) or Ang II-stimulated (100 nM) RVSMC
at various time points. We identified several differentially
expressed miRNAs using the stringent criteria that each
miRNA has more than 256 reads in at least one sample, and the
normalized reads show a more than 1.5-fold change after Ang II
treatment compared with the control group (Fig. 1A). Ang II
treatment triggered changes in some candidate miRNAs
including up-regulation of miR-132, miR-212, miR-129, miR21*, and miR-7a that were further validated by RT-qPCR (Fig.
1B). The levels of miR-145, known to be highly expressed in
VSMC (14), were not significantly altered by Ang II (Fig. 1B).
Because each miRNA target prediction algorithm (TargetScan, miRanda, and Diana-microT V3.0) has its own advantages, targets theoretically predicted by multiple bioinformatics
software and having conserved seed sequences are more likely
to be true targets. We, therefore, used these bioinformatics
tools and selected the targets that were predicted by at least two
databases and conserved across rat, mouse, and human. These
selected targets (2067 genes) were pooled and subjected to further bioinformatics analysis to identify biological processes and
signaling networks regulated by them. Gene Ontology analysis
by DAVID revealed significant enrichment of biological processes such as cell proliferation, cell migration, and cell adhesion, relevant to inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases (Fig.
1C). Furthermore, Ingenuity pathway analysis identified key
signaling pathways including ERK/MAPK signaling and PTEN
and CREB signaling, known to be involved in Ang II-mediated
VSMC dysfunction (Fig. 1D). These results showed that Ang II
can regulate several miRNAs in RVSMC and that their targets
may have potential functional roles in Ang II-induced effects in
VSMC.
Ang II Up-regulates miR-132 in RVSMC—Among the Ang
II-induced miRNAs that were validated from the smRNA Seq
data, miR-132 and miR-212 were the most highly up-regulated.
These miRNAs are reported to be expressed as a highly conserved cluster in vertebrates and can modulate diverse functions in different cell systems. Therefore, we further investigated the functional roles of these miRNA in VSMC and Ang II
actions. Time course experiments showed that miR-132/212
levels started to increase as early as 3 h after Ang II stimulation
and remained elevated up to 24 h after stimulation compared
with control (Ctrl) RVSMC (Fig. 2A). Dose-response experiments showed that Ang II potently induced both the miRNAs at
as low as 1 nM that remained elevated up to 10,000 nM (Fig. 2B).
In all subsequent experiments, RVSMC were stimulated with
Ang II at a concentration of 100 nM unless otherwise indicated.
Furthermore, pretreatment with AT1R blocker Losartan (10
␮M) markedly blocked Ang II-induced miR-132/212 in RVSMC
(Fig. 2C), demonstrating the role of AT1R activation.
We also examined whether the increased expression of these
miRNAs in response to Ang II could be due to increases in
primary transcript levels. We found that Pri-miR-132/212 levels were markedly up-regulated (by ⬎20-fold) in response to
Ang II. The levels increased by 1 h after Ang II stimulation and
MAY 4, 2012 • VOLUME 287 • NUMBER 19

remained elevated up to 24 h, suggesting the involvement of
transcriptional regulation in RVSMC (supplemental Fig. S1).
Because miR-132 and miR-212 share the same seed sequence
(AACAGUC), indicating they have the same targets, and
mature miR-132 is more abundant than miR-212 in RVSMC,
we examined the functions and targets of this cluster mostly
through modulating miR-132 levels in subsequent studies.
miR-132 Targets PTEN—TargetScan algorithm predicted
four miR-132/212 binding sites in the 3⬘-UTR of PTEN in rat
(Fig. 3A), and three of them were highly conserved in human
and mouse, suggesting PTEN could be a potential target of miR132. Because PTEN can have several protective effects in VSMC
(27, 28), we examined whether Ang II and miR-132 could
down-regulate PTEN in RVSMC. Results showed that Ang II
significantly inhibits the expression of the putative miR-132
target PTEN in RVSMC (Fig. 3B). Next, we observed that transfection of RVSMC with miR-132 mimic (132-M) oligonucleotides also significantly down-regulated both PTEN mRNA (Fig.
3C) and protein (Fig. 3D) levels relative to those transfected
with control mimic (NC-M) oligonucleotides. To verify if
PTEN is a direct target of miR-132, we cloned the PTEN
3⬘-UTR containing four miR-132 binding sites (nucleotides
1119 –2972) downstream of firefly luciferase reporter and cotransfected it along with 132-M or NC-M oligonucleotides into
RVSMC. Luciferase assays were performed 48 h post-transfection. Results showed significantly reduced luciferase activity in
132-M-transfected cells compared with NC-M (Fig. 3E). In
contrast, co-transfection with miR-132 hairpin inhibitor oligonucleotides (132-I) that inhibit miR-132 increased PTEN
3⬘-UTR activity relative to control inhibitor NC-I (Fig. 3F).
These results clearly demonstrate that PTEN is a direct and
novel target of miR-132 in RVSMC.
miR-132 Enhances MCP-1 Gene Expression in Part through
PTEN Inhibition—Next, we tested the functional relevance of
PTEN down-regulation. Previous studies in mouse VSMC
showed that PTEN knockdown increased the expression of
MCP-1 (29), which is also known to be induced by Ang II in
VSMC. In addition, PTEN overexpression was reported to suppress Ang II-induced MCP-1 mRNA expression (30). Therefore, we next examined the effect of miR-132 overexpression on
MCP-1 gene expression. Results showed that MCP-1 expression was significantly increased in RVSMC transfected with
132-M oligonucleotides relative to cells transfected with NC-M
(Fig. 4A). Our data also showed increased levels of MCP-1
mRNA in RVSMC transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing precursor miR-132 (LV-132-M) relative to the control vector (LV-Scr-M) (Fig. 4B). In contrast, inhibition of endogenous
miR-132 by lentiviral-expressed anti-miR-132 (LV-132-I) significantly blocked both basal and Ang II-induced MCP-1
mRNA levels relative to control vector (LV-Scr-I) (Fig. 4C), further confirming the role of miR-132 in MCP-1 expression.
Moreover, PTEN gene silencing by specific siRNAs (siPTEN)
(Fig. 4D) (mimicking miR-132 actions) indeed significantly
increased MCP-1 expression relative to control non-targeting
oligonucleotide (siNTC) in RVSMC (Fig. 4E). In contrast, the
overexpression of PTEN without its 3⬘-UTR (Fig. 4F) significantly suppressed 132-M-induced MCP-1 mRNA expression
(Fig. 4G), further supporting the role of PTEN in miR-132JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY

induced regulation of MCP-1. Together, these data suggest that
the down-regulation of PTEN by miR-132 could be one of the
mechanisms involved in augmenting MCP-1 expression in Ang
II-treated RVSMC.
miR-132 and CREB Form Positive Regulatory Feedback Loop—
Activation of CREB through MAPK-mediated Ser-133 phosphorylation plays an important role in Ang II-induced VSMC
dysfunction, including hypertrophy, extracellular matrix gene
expression, IL-6 up-regulation, and vascular remodeling (8,
31–33). Evidence shows that miR-132 could increase CREB
phosphorylation by targeting inhibitors of upstream Ras-Raf1ERK signaling, including ras GTPase-activating protein 1
(RASA1 or p120RasGAP), in rat neuronal cells and HEK293
cells (34). RASA1 was also validated as a miR-132 target in
endothelial cells, and this was associated with vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis (24). Therefore, we
tested if miR-132 can also regulate CREB activity in RVSMC.
We first observed that transfection with 132-M significantly
increased phospho-CREB (pCREB) levels without changes in
the internal controls including total CREB (tCREB) and ␤-actin
(Fig. 5A, left panel). Next, we examined the effect of miR-132
inhibition on pCREB levels. Results showed a significant reduction in Ang II-induced pCREB levels in RVSMC transfected

RASA1 without the miR-132/212 binding sites can attenuate
Ang II effects on CREB activation. Results showed that overexpression of a miR-resistant RASA1 construct lacking its
3⬘-UTR (24) decreased Ang II-induced pCREB levels without
affecting the internal controls (Fig. 5F). Together, these data
demonstrate that miR-132 can amplify CREB activation and
enhance Ang II functions in RVSMC.
Both miR-132 and miR-212 are transcribed from an intergenic region on rat chromosome 10 and regulated by CREB in
neurons (35). However, it is not known whether CREB activation plays a role in Ang II-induced miR-132 up-regulation in

15678 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY

VSMC. To examine this, we knocked down CREB protein levels
by transfection with siRNAs targeting CREB (siCREB) relative
to non-targeting control oligonucleotides (siNTC) (Fig. 5G,
tCREB). Levels of pCREB were also reduced (Fig. 5G, pCREB).
Furthermore, CREB down-regulation by siCREB led to significant inhibition of both basal and Ang II-induced expression of
mature miR-132 and miR-212 (Fig. 5H). Some minimal residual
Ang II effects may due to either the incomplete knockdown of
CREB or that other transcription factors are also involved in
up-regulating miR-132 expression (36). These results demonstrate that CREB activation is required for miR-132/212 upregulation by Ang II and also the operation of a positive feedback loop that can amplify miR-132 expression and CREB
activation in RVSMC.
Ang II Infusion Increases miR-132/212 in Vivo in Mice
Aorta—We next examined the in vivo relevance using aortas
from Ang II-infused mice. Alzet miniosmotic pumps were
implanted subcutaneously in male C57BL/6J mice to deliver
Ang II or the vehicle PBS for a 2-week period according to
reported protocols (37). At the end of the infusion period, aortas were collected from both PBS- and Ang-II infused mice,
adventitia were removed, and gene expression was examined by
RT-qPCR. Results showed that the expression of miR-132 (Fig.
6A) and miR-212 (Fig. 6B) as well as the downstream inflammatory marker MCP-1 (Fig. 6C) were significantly increased in
aortas from Ang II-infused mice compared with PBS treated
mice. Furthermore, expression of the miR-132 target PTEN
showed a decreased trend that was, however, not statistically
significant (Fig. 6D). Overall, these results suggest that Ang II
infusion can significantly induce miR-132/212, enhance
MCP-1, and attenuate PTEN gene expression, supporting the
in vivo relevance.
Unbiased Microarray Screening Reveals That Subset of Genes
Down-regulated by Ang II in RVSMC Are Predicted Targets of
miR-132—To determine if Ang II induced up-regulation of
miR-132 can affect its target genes related to VSMC functions
or cardiovascular disease, we next adopted a more unbiased
profiling approach. Because mammalian miRNAs can function
through repression of mRNA levels (38), we performed
Affymetrix transcriptome profiling of RNA obtained from
RVSMC treated with Ang II for various time periods at which
miR-132 was also up-regulated. Then we selected putative miR132 targets predicted by TargetScan (context score ⬍⫺0.20,
pCT ⬎ 0.20) from genes down-regulated by Ang II (p ⬍ 0.05,
⫺fold change ⬎1.2) (Fig. 7A) as they are likely to be directly repressed by miR-132 in response to Ang II. This
approach revealed that 49 potential miR-132 target genes were
down-regulated in Ang II-treated RVSMC (Fig. 7B). RASA1 is
not represented in this heatmap because it was decreased by
17% in the original microarray, whereas for this comparison our
selection criteria was at least 20% downregulation by Ang II.
IPA was next used to uncover potential biological processes
mediated by these 49 down-regulated genes. Results showed
that these miR-132 targets could be associated with processes
such as regulation of cell cycle, cell morphology, and cellular
movement as well as cardiovascular system development, function, and disease (Fig. 7C). We next tested five genes enriched in
these biological functions for further validation by RT-qPCR in

indicated time points relative to control cells (Fig. 7D). Furthermore, transfection of 132-M oligonucleotides also attenuated
their expression in RVSMC compared with those transfected
with control NC-M (Fig. 7E). Together these data suggest that,
by targeting multiple genes with key relevant functions, miR132 may have multiple roles in Ang II-mediated VSMC
dysfunction.

DISCUSSION
In this study we used the smRNA-Seq method for the first
time to profile Ang II-regulated miRNAs in VSMC and also
observed that some of these miRNAs can act as novel mediators
and modulators of Ang II actions in VSMC. Importantly, we
demonstrated the up-regulation of miR-132/212 cluster by Ang
II both in vitro in RVSMC and in vivo in Ang II-infused mice.
We also showed that miR-132 could modulate Ang II-mediated
MCP-1 gene expression in VSMC at least in part through its
novel target PTEN. Moreover, our results demonstrated the
role of AT1R and CREB in miR-132/212 regulation and established a positive feedback loop between CREB activation and
miR-132/212 expression in RVSMC, potentially through downregulation of the miR-132 target RASA1 (Fig. 8). Furthermore,
we used a more unbiased approach to demonstrate that other
potential targets of miR-132 could modulate processes associated with cardiovascular disease functions such as cell cycle and
cell motility.

Ang II-induced miR-132 in VSMC

FIGURE 8. Schematic diagram shows the role of miR-132/212 in Ang IIinduced VSMC dysfunction. Ang II signaling through AT1R activates CREB
(Ser-133 phosphorylation) and increases levels of miR-132 and miR-212 cluster. Increased levels of miR-132 inhibit the expression of PTEN via targeting its
3⬘-UTRs. PTEN inhibition increases key proinflammatory gene MCP-1. On the
other hand, down-regulation of RASA1, an inhibitor of Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway, leads to activation of CREB, a key regulator of VSMC dysfunction. CREB
activation can also promote a positive feedback mechanism by further
increasing miR-132 and miR-212 levels.

FIGURE 7. A subset of genes down-regulated by Ang II are putative miR132 targets. A, a flowchart shows the strategy used to identify multiple miR132 targets in Ang II-treated RVSMC by overlapping TargetScan-predicted
miR-132 targets (context score ⬍-0.2, pCT ⬎0.2) with Ang II-down-regulated

based on the strategy shown in A, listing Ang II-down-regulated genes that
are also potential miR-132 targets in RVSMC. The log2 intensity of gene
expression levels was subtracted by the mean expression of the corresponding gene in control samples to directly reflect gene expression changes after
Ang II treatment. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was then applied to
cluster genes down-regulated by Ang II at different time points. C, IPA analysis
of potential Ang II relevant biological functions enriched in genes listed in B is

Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies
have led to high throughput and robust approaches such as
smRNA-Seq that can quantify miRNA expression genomewide and also lead to the discovery of new miRNAs. These
approaches have provided highly useful and novel information
with human and mouse cells. However, similar analysis in rat
cells has been difficult because the rat genome annotation is still
relatively incomplete. Our studies provide the first smRNA-Seq
data base catalogue of RVSMC. We observed that Ang II can
differentially regulate several miRNAs in RVSMC, with miR132/212 being the most highly induced. Our smRNA-Seq data
also showed that miR-143/145 cluster, miR-21, and let-7 family
members are the most abundant miRNAs in RVSMC, similar to
that reported in mouse and human VSMC (14 –16, 39), but Ang
II treatment in vitro did not affect their expression significantly
(⬍1.5-fold changes). However, this does not rule out the possibility that in vivo these miRNAs may contribute to Ang II-me-

diated vascular dysfunction by fine-tuning target gene expression (12).
Bioinformatics approaches indicated that the predicted targets of differentially expressed miRNAs could be enriched in
several well known Ang II-regulated biological processes and
signaling pathways. DAVID analysis suggested that these predicted targets of Ang II-regulated miRNAs are likely to be
involved in cell proliferation, migration, and translation regulation processes (Fig. 1C) relevant to VSMC hyperplasia and
hypertrophy associated with hypertension, restenosis, and atherosclerosis. Several signaling pathways activated by Ang II
contribute to VSMC proliferation, hypertrophy, and migration,
including tyrosine kinases (6), MAPKs, Akt, and CREB (6, 32).
IPA analysis of Ang II-responsive miRNA targets revealed
enrichment of several of these pathways including ERK/MAPK,
PI3K/Akt, PTEN, and CREB signaling (p ⬍ 1 ⫻ 10⫺7), supporting our hypothesis that these miRNAs can regulate VSMC dysfunction. This was further supported by experimental evidence
that miR-132 could activate CREB and down-regulate RASA1
and PTEN, key signaling molecules associated with aberrant
VSMC gene expression and signaling. Further experimental
studies are needed to confirm the functional roles of other Ang
II-regulated miRNAs and their predicted targets.
In this study we focused on the conserved miR-132/212 cluster as they were highly induced by Ang II in vitro and in vivo.
Moreover, although the functions of these miRNAs have been
demonstrated in different biological contexts such as nervous
system, endocrine system, innate immunity, and vascular endothelium, their role in VSMC is not known. These miRNAs are
transcribed from an intergenic region on rat chromosome 10
and have been shown to be regulated by upstream CREB binding sites in neuronal cells (35). Our studies demonstrated that
CREB knockdown decreased Ang II-induced miR-132/212
expression, suggesting a direct role for CREB in mature miR132/212 cluster regulation by Ang II. Furthermore, miR-132 in
turn could activate CREB, demonstrating a positive feedback

loop between CREB and miR-132/212 in RVSMC (Figs. 5 and
8). A similar regulatory mechanism was also recently implicated in cocaine-stimulated neurons (34). Ang II-induced
CREB activation plays a key role in inflammatory and extracellular matrix gene expression and hypertrophy (8, 31–33). Thus,
miR-132/212 could play an important role in these processes by
amplifying CREB signaling. Evidence also shows a key role for
CREB in VSMC phenotypic modulation (40); however, the role
of miR-132/212-induced CREB activation in these events
awaits further investigation.
Reports show that miR-132 has diverse effects on inflammatory responses in different cell types. These include inhibition
of inflammatory gene expression by targeting proinflammatory
acetylcholinesterase in neurons (41) and coactivator histone
acetyl transferase p300 in monocytes (42). In contrast, miR-132
enhanced inflammatory gene expression through targeting Sirtuin1, a histone deacetylase that inhibits NF-␬B activation in
preadipocytes and adipocytes (43). We observed that miR-132
mimic increased MCP-1 expression in VSMC, whereas its
inhibitor blocked Ang II-induced MCP-1 expression. However,
miR-132 did not have a significant effect on another proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, suggesting some level of specificity.
MCP-1 is a major inflammatory mediator and chemoattractant
(11) that also promotes VSMC migration and proliferation (44,
45). Ang II-induced MCP-1 promotes the accumulation of
macrophages and lymphocytes in the atherosclerotic lesions of
animal models (46, 47). We also identified PTEN as a direct
target of miR-132. Furthermore, PTEN gene silencing by specific siRNAs increased MCP-1 expression, whereas its overexpression inhibited both Ang II- and miR-132-induced MCP-1,
suggesting PTEN down-regulation as one of the mechanisms
involved in miR-132-induced MCP-1 expression. However,
increases in MCP-1 expression by PTEN gene silencing was
much lower than that induced by miR-132 transfection, suggesting that other pathways such as NF-␬B activation through
targeting Sirtuin 1 (43) and RASA1 might also be involved. Previous studies showed that PTEN gene silencing or VSMC-specific PTEN knockdown increased inflammatory gene expression, neointima formation, growth, migration, and vascular
remodeling (27, 29, 30, 48). Thus, miR-132 may augment Ang
II-mediated VSMC dysfunction by modulating some of these
processes. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a downstream effector
of Ang II actions (49), plays a key role in Ang II-induced MCP-1
expression in VSMC (9). Furthermore, H2O2 directly stimulates CREB activation (50) and increases miR-132 (51) in
VSMC. Based on our data that CREB is required for Ang IIinduced miR-132 transcription, it is possible that Ang II-generated H2O2 might also promote MCP-1 expression through
increasing miR-132 in RVSMC.
In vivo relevance was supported by our observations that Ang
II infusion could significantly induce miR-132/212 and enhance
MCP-1 expression in mice aortas. Under the same conditions,
the miR-132/212 target PTEN was also attenuated, although
not statistically significant. This may be due to the fact that,
besides smooth muscle cells, aortas also contain other cell
types. Because miRNA effects are known to be cell type-specific, it is possible that PTEN was not efficiently targeted by
miR-132/212 in cell types other than VSMC.
MAY 4, 2012 • VOLUME 287 • NUMBER 19

We also identified additional novel miR-132 targets by
microarray profiling of Ang II down-regulated genes in
RVSMC coupled with bioinformatics analysis. This method is
advantageous because it can identify multiple putative VSMCspecific miR-132 targets among the down-regulated genes in an
unbiased manner. However, we might have also missed some
true miR-132 targets due to the stringent criteria used as well as
other mechanisms such as translation inhibition of target
mRNAs. Interestingly, IPA analysis of the miR-132 targets
identified in this comparative analysis indicated their potential
regulatory roles in cell growth, morphology, and movement
(functions related to Ang II effects in VSMC and cardiovascular
disease). Similar to PTEN, Foxo3 (52) was reported to inhibit
VSMC cell cycle progression and, hence, neointimal hyperplasia. Moreover, Zeb2 (53), Arhgef11 (54), Sox4 (55), and Ssh2
(56) have been shown in other systems to modulate cell cycle,
cellular apoptosis, or morphological changes, which are again
Ang II-related biological processes. Therefore, biological functions mediated by these potential miR-132 targets are worthy of
further investigations in the future.
In summary, we have demonstrated a new role for miRNAs
in Ang II actions and in particular the up-regulation of miR-132
and miR-212 by Ang II in vitro and in vivo as well as the role of
miR-132 in key Ang II responses including CREB activation and
inflammatory gene expression. We also demonstrated a positive feedback loop between CREB signaling and miR-132, suggesting that this circuitry may fine-tune and amplify Ang IImediated gene expression (Fig. 8). Because miRNAs generally
regulate multiple genes, miR-132 and miR-212 up-regulation
could have profound effects on several genes involved in VSMC
dysfunction and thus serve as potential therapeutic targets for
Ang II-mediated cardiovascular diseases.
