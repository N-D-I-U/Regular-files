SIRT1 ameliorates oxidative
stress induced neural cell death and is
down‑regulated in Parkinson’s disease
Preeti Singh1,2, Peter S. Hanson1 and Christopher M. Morris1,2*

Abstract
Background: Sirtuins (SIRTs) are ­NAD+ dependent lysine deacetylases which are conserved from bacteria to humans
and have been associated with longevity and lifespan extension. SIRT1, the best studied mammalian SIRT is involved
in many physiological and pathological processes and changes in SIRT1 have been implicated in neurodegenerative
disorders, with SIRT1 having a suggested protective role in Parkinson’s disease. In this study, we determined the effect
of SIRT1 on cell survival and α-synuclein aggregate formation in SH-SY5Y cells following oxidative stress.
Results: Over-expression of SIRT1 protected SH-SY5Y cells from toxin induced cell death and the protection conferred by SIRT1 was partially independent of its deacetylase activity, which was associated with the repression of
NF-кB and cPARP expression. SIRT1 reduced the formation of α-synuclein aggregates but showed minimal co-localisation with α-synuclein. In post-mortem brain tissue obtained from patients with Parkinson’s disease, Parkinson’s
disease with dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer’s disease, the activity of SIRT1 was observed to be
down-regulated.
Conclusions: These findings suggests a negative effect of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative disorders and possibly explain the reduced activity of SIRT1 in neurodegenerative disorders. Our study shows that SIRT1 is a pro-survival
protein that is downregulated under cellular stress.

Background
SIRT1 is a N
­ AD+ dependent class III histone deacetylase
that shares homology with yeast silent information regulator, SIR2. SIRT1 is primarily a nuclear protein that shuttles to the cytoplasm depending upon the cell type and
stress [1]. SIRT1 targets histones and non-histones proteins that are involved in the regulation of several physiological processes including mitochondrial biogenesis,
antioxidant defence mechanisms, DNA repair, apoptosis
and genomic stability [2]. SIR2 promotes lifespan extension in yeast [3] and brain specific overexpression of its

mammalian homologue, SIRT1 has been reported to
delay ageing in SIRT1 overexpressing female and male
transgenic mice [4]. In support of this protective effect in
ageing, SIRT1 is also implicated in life span extension in
mice that are either calorie restricted [5] or on standard
diet [6]. These studies show that SIRT1 when activated or
overexpressed in a tissue-specific manner can slow down
ageing and enhance life span.
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common
neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) and the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder [7, 8]. The characteristic pathological
features of the disease are the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurones in the substantia nigra and the accumulation of α-synuclein rich Lewy bodies and Lewy
neurites in brain stem, spinal cord and cortical regions
[9]. The causes of PD are still unknown, although several

environmental and genetic risk factors are suggested as
being causative. Ageing is however, the largest single risk
factor for the development and progression of neurodegeneration by affecting a number of key cellular processes. At the molecular level, apoptosis, oxidative stress
and mitochondrial dysfunction have been shown to promote neurodegeneration. SIRT1 has shown to inhibit
apoptosis by regulating p53, reducing oxidative stress by
regulating antioxidant defences via FOXO family members, and regulates mitochondrial biogenesis mediated by
PGC-1α [10]. SIRT1 also maintains genomic stability by
modulating histone acetylation. SIRT1 has been shown to
exert neuroprotection against oxidative stress. In models
of PD, rotenone and ­MPP+ are known to reduce SIRT1 in
primary cultures which may imply that due to reduction
of SIRT1, neurones have reduced ability to combat oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction [11]. SIRT1
is neuroprotective by deacetylating and consequently
activating PGC-1α and maintains mitochondrial homeostasis by elevating antioxidant defences against MPTP
mediated neurotoxicity [12].
Given the possible protective role of SIRT1 in PD, we
evaluated the role of SIRT1 and its enzymatic activity
in oxidative stress mediated cell death and also characterised the involvement of SIRT1 in PD. The effects of
over-expression and deacetylase activity of SIRT1 on
cell survival and α-synuclein aggregate formation were
determined in diquat or rotenone treated SH-SY5Y cells.
Protein expression and activity of SIRT1 was also determined in post-mortem human brain tissue obtained from
patients with PD, PD with dementia (PDD), dementia
with Lewy bodies (DLB) and AD.

Methods
SH‑SY5Y cell culture

SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were obtained from the
European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC, Salisbury,
UK) and cultured as described previously [13]. Cells were
grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air/5%
­CO2.
SIRT1 overexpression and toxin treatment in SH‑SY5Y cells

Wild type SIRT1 (Flag-SIRT1 was a generous gift from
Michael Greenberg; Addgene; Plasmid number 1791)
and catalytically inactive SIRT1H363Y (Flag-SIRT1
H363Y; Addgene; Plasmid number 1792 from Michael
Greenberg) plasmids [14] were obtained from Addgene
and sub-cloned in pLenti CMV blast (a gift from Eric
Campeau Addgene plasmid number 17486) and empty
pLenti CMV blast wild type served as a control [15].
SH-SY5Y cells were seeded in 12 well plates and the
cells were transfected with SIRT1 or SIRT1H363Y plasmid (1.5 µg/well) and the control group was transfected

with empty pLenti CMV plasmids using PEI (polyethyleneimine; Invitrogen) and plasmids were incubated with
cells at 37 °C for 48 h. Stably transfected cells were also
studied following selection of lines using 5 µg/ml Blasticidin and amplification of lines. Transfected cells were
treated with either diquat (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) dissolved
in PBS (phosphate buffered saline; Sigma-Aldrich) or
rotenone (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl
sulphoxide, Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of
0.2% PBS/DMSO and incubated overnight for 20 h. Cell
viability was determined by Alamar Blue reduction assay
[13].
Western blotting

Following Alamar Blue fluorescence, cell lysates were
prepared by scraping the viable cells in native lysis buffer
(1% 10× tris buffered saline (TBS), 0.27 M Sucrose, 1%
Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail). The cell
lysates were sonicated for 20 s using a sonic probe and the
total protein determined using Bradford Assay (modified
from [16]). Twenty micrograms of protein in cell lysates
were subjected to electrophoresis and were probed using
selected antibodies in a manner as described previously
[13] using GAPDH as a housekeeping internal loading
control protein.
Fluorescence immunocytochemistry

SH-SY5Y cells were grown in chamber slides (BD Falcon, UK) and were transfected with SIRT1 plasmids and
treated with diquat or rotenone. The cells were washed
with PBS and slides incubated with 4% formaldehyde
(Sigma-Aldrich) in warm 1× PBS for 15 min and then
washed with PBS and stored until use in 10% glycerol
(Sigma-Aldrich, UK) at 4 °C. Cells were washed and
blocked in 1× PBS/5% goat serum/0.3% Triton X-100
for an hour then incubated overnight at 4 °C with antiSIRT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-phosphoα-synuclein (Wako, Saitama, Japan) for α˗synuclein
aggregates. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated
with secondary antibodies (LifeSciences, Glasgow, UK)
for 60 min protected from light. Cells were washed with
PBS and counterstained and mounted with ProLong
Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Thermo Fisher).
Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with a 40× objective and images captured at 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution
for analysis. Images were quantified using ImageJ (NIH,
Bethesda, USA). Phospho-α-synuclein aggregate immunoreactivity was determined by using a standardised custom histogram based coloured thresholding technique
and then subjected to analyse particles in ImageJ. The
parameters recorded were total area and percentage area
of staining.

Post‑mortem tissue analysis

Brain samples were obtained from Newcastle Brain Tissue
Resource, a Human Tissue Authority licensed tissue bank.
Tissue was obtained at post-mortem as soon as possible
after death and samples snap frozen and stored at −80 °C.
Frozen tissue of the relevant region was identified and
protein homogenates from PD, DLB, PDD, AD and control (Table 1) were prepared by homogenising approximately 250 mg of freshly thawed grey matter in 2.5 ml
of 0.2 M triethylammonium bicarbonate containing 1×
protease inhibitor. After addition of 10 µl of 10% SDS to
500 µl of homogenate, samples were vortexed and then
sonicated using a sonic probe for 15 s, followed by sonication on ice in a sonic bath for 40 min. The concentration
of protein was determined by Bradford assay. Western
blotting was performed as previously [13] using GAPDH
as a housekeeping internal loading control protein.
Sirtuin activity

Brain protein homogenates were thawed and vortexed
and sonicated as previously and samples spun down at
100×g at 4 °C for 5 min and the protein concentration of
supernatant was determined by Bradford assay. Fluorescent SIRT substrate (p53 379–382), Ac-RHKK(Ac)-AMC
was synthesised by Cambridge Research Biolabs, UK.
Stock peptide was prepared as a 5 mM solution in diluted
SIRT Assay buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, containing
137 mM sodium chloride, 2.7 mM potassium chloride, and
1 mM magnesium chloride) and was stored at -70 °C until
use. Total SIRT activity was determined by using 30 μg
protein in substrate buffer containing 41.6 µM peptide,
1 mM ­NAD+ and 100 nM Trichostatin A (as an Histone
Deacetylase inhibitor) and incubated at room temperature
for 2 h on a shaker. After 2 h 2.5 μg/ml trypsin in 50 mM
nicotinamide (NAM) was added to stop further deacetylation and to cleave the deacetylated product. The fluorescence was recorded for each well after 1 h of incubation
of the trypsin-NAM solution in the plate reader on excitation wavelength of 350–360 nm and emission wavelength
of 450–460 nm. SIRT1 activity was determined as EX527

(10 μM) inhibitable activity. (Please refer to Additional
file 3: Figure S3 for sample and buffer preparation).
Statistical analyses

Statistical analysis was performed using one-way
ANOVA within groups and two-way ANOVA within two
groups using SPSS21 (IBM) followed by appropriate post
hoc (Bonferroni) non-parametric testing. Error bars represent standard deviation (±SD). p < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Statistical analysis of Western
blotting data was performed in GraphPad Prism using a
two samples t test assuming unequal variances using protein/GAPDH ratios. Statistical significance was considered as p < 0.05. The results are presented as mean ± SD.

Results
SIRT1 reduces toxin induced cell death

Exposure to environmental factors, such as rotenone and
diquat has been shown to lead to oxidative damage in
dopaminergic neurones leading to parkinsonian symptoms in animal and cellular models [17]. In diquat treated
cells, SIRT1WT transfected cells (see Additional file 1:
Figure S1) showed increased rates of cell survival compared to control cells (20 µM or 10 µM diquat: p < 0.001)
and SIRT1H363Y cells (20 µM diquat: p < 0.01; 10 µM
diquat: p < 0.001). Interestingly, increased cell viability was observed in SIRT1H363Y transfected cell compared to control cells (20 µM or 10 µM diquat: p < 0.001)
(Fig. 1). In cells treated with rotenone, SIRT1WT and
SIRT1H363Y overexpression enhanced cell viability
(rotenone 20 μM or 0.5 μM rotenone—p < 0.001) compared to control cells where SIRT1WT overexpression
was more potent in combating oxidative stress (Fig. 1).
Similar findings to transiently transfected cells were
found in stably transfected cells (data not shown).

pLenti CMV transfected cells the levels were elevated by
55–60% in rotenone treated cells (20 or 0.5 µM rotenone,
p < 0.001; Fig. 1). Following toxin treatments (diquat: 20
or 10 µM and rotenone: 20 or 0.5 µM) in all cells the levels of SIRT1 were reduced by 45–50% compared to 0.2%
vehicle treatment (p < 0.01, Additional file 1: Figure S1).
We also analysed the expression of active cleaved Poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) under oxidative
stress and observed that SIRT1 overexpression reduced
the protein level of cPARP-1 (diquat: 20 or 10 µM and
rotenone: 20 or 0.5 µM by 50–60%; p < 0.001) and similar result was also observed in SIRT1H363Y transfected
cells, (diquat: 20 or 10 µM and rotenone: 20 or 0.5 µM
by 40–45%; p < 0.001), compared to pLenti CMV transfected cells (Fig. 3). Western blot analysis failed to detect
the levels of cleaved caspase 3, a finding that has been
observed previously [13].

the possible mechanism behind this protection, cells were
probed for NF-κB. The levels of NF-κB were reduced
by 32–35% in SIRT1WT (p < 0.001) and by 23–24%
in SIRT1H363Y (p < 0.001) cells treated with 0.2% PBS
compared with pLenti CMV transfected cells (Fig. 2). In
diquat treated cells, the levels of NF-κB were reduced by
50–55% in SIRT1WT (20 µM or 10 µM diquat, p < 0.001)
cells and by 35–40% in SIRT1H363Y (20 µM or 10 µM
diquat, p < 0.001) when compared to 0.2% PBS treated
control cells. On the other hand, in pLenti CMV transfected cells, diquat treatment enhanced the level of
NF-κB by ~50% (20 µM or 10 µM diquat, p < 0.001) compared to 0.2% PBS treatment (Fig. 2). In rotenone treated
cells, the levels of NF-κB in 0.2% DMSO treated cells
were reduced by ~34 and ~25% in SIRT1WT (p < 0.001)
and SIRT1H363Y (p < 0.001) transfected cells, respectively, compared to pLenti CMV transfected cells (Fig. 1).
Following rotenone treatment, the levels of NF-κB were
reduced by approximately 55% in SIRT1WT cells (20 or
0.5 µM rotenone, p < 0.001) and by approximately 35% in
SIRT1H363Y (20 or 0.5 µM rotenone, p < 0.001), whilst in

SIRT1 is generally localised to the nucleus and depending upon environmental cues and cell types, and can
translocate to the cytoplasm [1] and also to mitochondria
[18]. Nuclear SIRT1 targets the proteins involved in DNA
repair, antioxidant defence, genomic stability and apoptosis [19], whereas localisation of SIRT1 in the cytoplasm
augments cells sensitivity to apoptosis [20]. In diquat
or rotenone treated cells, SIRT1 was predominantly
localised to the nucleus with lower levels of protein
observed in the cytoplasm in pLenti CMV, SIRT1WT
or SIRT1H363Y transfected SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 4).
Nuclear localisation of SIRT1 correlates with its prosurvival activity under oxidative stress. In the nucleus,
SIRT1 targets FOXO family members and promotes the
expression of proteins involved in antioxidant defence
mechanisms and simultaneously inhibits the expression
of targets involved in promotion of apoptosis [14] and
also enhances DNA repair [21].
Under basal conditions, we observed small punctate
cytoplasmic accumulations of phosphor-α-synuclein
staining which was reduced following SIRT1WT treatment (p < 0.01, Fig. 5) but not with catalytically inactive SIRT1H363Y transfected cells. On treatment with
diquat or rotenone, a significant reduction in the number of phospho-α-synuclein aggregates was observed in
both SIRT1WT and SIRT1H363Y transfected cells compared to pLenti CMV transfected cells (p < 0.001; Fig. 5).
SIRT1 showed minimal co-localisation with phospho-αsynuclein hence its effect on aggregate formation could
possibly be through a positive action on ROS scavenging.
Compared to SIRT1WT transfected cells, phospho-αsynuclein aggregation was higher in SIRT1H363Y transfected cells (p < 0.001; Fig. 5).

SIRT1 protein in neurodegenerative disorders

We determined SIRT1 protein and enzyme activity in
post mortem human brain tissue in PD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Two isoforms of SIRT1 protein are known (UniProt Q96EB6 (SIRT1_HUMAN),
SIRT1FL; predicted molecular weight 80 kDa) however the observed molecular weight on Western blot is
~120 kDa possibly due to post translational modifications
[22] along with a shorter form, isoform 2, of approximately 75 kDa. The 120 kDa SIRT1 isoform was observed

only in frontal cortex samples and SIRT1 isoform 2 was
observed only in the temporal cortex samples.
In the frontal cortex samples of PD, the levels of
120 kDa SIRT1 were reduced by 28% compared to controls (p < 0.05) whereas no significant difference was
observed in the levels of SIRT1FL (80 kDa). In the temporal cortex samples from PD cases, the levels of 80 kDa
SIRT1FL were elevated by 15% (p < 0.01) and 75 kDa
isoform 2 were elevated by 36% (p < 0.001) compared
to controls. In the putamen or cerebellum of PD cases,

no significant differences were observed in the levels of
80 kDa SIRT1FL isoform when compared to control
(Fig. 6).
In the frontal cortex of PDD, no significant differences were observed in the levels of 80 kDa SIRT1FL
and 120kDaSIRT1 compared to control. In the temporal
cortex of PDD, no significant difference was observed in
the level of SIRT1FL but the level of the 75 kDa isoform
2 was reduced by 26% compared to control (p < 0.01). In
the putamen or cerebellum of PDD cases, no significant
differences were observed in the levels of SIRT1 when
compared to control (Fig. 7).
In the frontal cortex of DLB, no changes were observed
in the levels of 120 kDaSIRT1 whereas, SIRT1FL was

up regulated by 22% (p < 0.05). In the temporal cortex
of DLB, SIRT1FL was up regulated by 38% (p < 0.001)
whilst, no changes were observed in the levels of isoform
2. In the putamen or hippocampus of DLB cases, no significant difference was observed in the levels of SIRT1
when compared to control. The expression of SIRT1 was
up regulated by 21% (p < 0.05) in the cerebellum of DLB
cases compared to control (Additional file 2: Figure S2).
In the frontal cortex of AD, the levels of 120 kDa SIRT1
and 80 kDa SIRT1FL were reduced by 30% (p < 0.01)
and 26% (p < 0.01), respectively, when compared to control. In the temporal cortex of AD, the levels of 80kDa
SIRT1FL were reduced by 25% (p < 0.01), whereas, no
significant change was observed in the level of isoform

levels of SIRT1 were reduced by 36% (p < 0.01) and 30%
(p < 0.001), respectively, compared to control (Additional

SIRT1 activity in neurodegenerative disorders

In the frontal cortex, measurement of total SIRT activity did not show any significant change between the disease groups and control (p > 0.05); however, compared to
AD, the total SIRT activity was reduced in PD and DLB
by about 20% (p < 0.01), though PDD did not show any
significant difference. Specific SIRT1 activity was down
regulated in PD (43%; p < 0.001), PDD (39%; p < 0.001),
DLB (32%; p < 0.001) and AD (31%; p < 0.001) compared
to controls (F 20.457, p < 0.001). In the temporal cortex,
there was no significant difference in total SIRT activity

between the disease groups and control (p > 0.05), however, compared to AD there was a significant reduction
of 33% in total SIRT activity in PDD (p < 0.05), though
other groups did not show any significant change. SIRT1
activity was reduced in PD (25%; p < 0.01), PDD (23%;
p < 0.05), DLB (30%; p < 0.001) and AD (22%; p < 0.05)
compared to controls (F: 6.265, p < 0.001) whereas no
significant difference was seen among the disease groups
(Fig. 8).

Discussion
Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the production
of free radicals and antioxidant defence that leads to DNA,
protein and lipid damage that may eventually lead to cell
death. Oxidative stress has been suggested to play a role
in the development and progression of neurodegenerative

disorders [23]. SIRT1, a ­NAD+ dependent deacetylase, is
a redox sensor and has been shown to regulate key cellular processes including antioxidant defence, DNA repair
and genomic stability [2]. In this context, we determined
the role of SIRT1 in cell survival under oxidative stress.
The results of our study showed increased cell survival in
SIRT1WT and SIRT1H363Y transfected cells compared
to control cells, nonetheless, SIRT1WT showed the highest rate of cell survival. In SN4741 DA neurones, Mudo
et al. [12] reported the protective effect of SIRT1 following MPTP treatment cells which was mediated through

activation of PGC-1α leading to enhanced expression of
the mitochondrial antioxidants manganese superoxide
dismutase and Thioredoxin-2. In a recent study it was
shown that SIRT1 alleviated rotenone induced cell death
in SH-SY5Y cells by regulating expression of histone H3
and p53 [24]. The present results are in line with these
findings and establishes the pro-survival role of SIRT1
against oxidative stress induced by diquat or rotenone in
SH-SY5Y cells.
The findings of our study also show that the protection conferred by SIRT1 was partly independent of its

Fig. 7 Expression of SIRT1 protein in post mortem brain of Parkinson’s disease with dementia. The levels of SIRT1 were determined in different
regions of Parkinson’s disease with dementia patients and compared to a control cohort. SIRT1 band intensity was normalised with GAPDH as
a housekeeping protein. Data are presented as fold change (±SD) with respect to control from three independent replicates. **p < 0.01 (t test).

deacetylase activity as the enzymatic inactive SIRT1
H363Y mutant also protected the cells from diquat or
rotenone induced cell death. Similar to the findings
of this study, Pfister et al., showed that SIRT1WT and
mutant forms lacking deacetylase activity (H363Y and
H355A) protected cerebellar granule neurones from
low-potassium induced toxicity, though in their study
the extent of protection by mutant forms was similar to
SIRT1WT [25]. The difference between their and our
study could be attributed to the type of cell used and

also the trigger causing cellular stress but does indicate
that effects of SIRT1 can be independent of deacetylase
activity.
The protection conferred by SIRT1 appears to be
mediated at least in part through suppression of NF-кB
expression, similar to the effect of SIRT1 on NF-кB
observed by Ghosh et al., who reported that SIRT1 and
SIRT1H363Y repressed NF-кB activity [26]. NF-кB
transcription factors regulate inflammation and immunity processes [27] and also play an important role in

Fig. 8 Total sirtuin activity and specific SIRT1 activities in frontal and temporal cortex in neurodegeneration. Total SIRT and SIRT1 activities were
measured using a fluorometric enzymatic activity assay with specific SIRT1 inhibition in the frontal and temporal cortices of PD, PDD, DLB and AD
patients and were compared to cohort-control group. ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01 and *p < 0.05 when compared to control, one-way ANOVA (Bonferroni corrected)

cell growth and development, and apoptosis [28]. ROS
in cells are known to activate NF-кB leading to transactivation of targets involved in protection against ROS
[29] and under high oxidative stress, activation of NF-кB
enhances cell death [30]. The results from our study show
that SIRT1 protects cells from oxidative stress in part by
repressing the expression of NF-кB suggesting that possibly NF-кB enhances cell death on treatment with diquat
or rotenone.
PARP-1 (116 kDa) is a nuclear protein involved in
detection and repair of DNA damage and is also activated during apoptosis and necrosis [13, 31] and SIRT1
conferred protection to cells by reducing the levels of
cleaved PARP-1 (89 kDa) following diquat or rotenone
exposure. Rajamohan et al. [32] showed that SIRT1 deacetylates PARP-1 under stress resulting in reduction of
PARP-1 mediated cell death. They also observed that
SIRT1 negatively regulates the PARP-1 gene promoter
and controls the PARP-1 expression at a transcriptional
level. The results from our study are in accord with these
findings with reduced levels of cleaved PARP-1 protein
in both SIRT1 WT and SIRT1H363Y cells possibly via

a mechanism independent of the deacetylase activity of
SIRT1 through transcriptional changes.
Lewy bodies (LBs) composed of abnormally folded
and aggregated α-synuclein proteins, are a characteristic feature of PD and other Lewy bodies disorders [33].
α-synuclein is a small pre-synaptic protein that undergoes
oligomerisation and aggregation resulting in fibrillation
and formation of LBs. Several factors trigger oligomerisation of α-synuclein including oxidative stress and in
this study, we observed a low level of basal phosphor-αsynuclein accumulation which was reduced slightly by
SIRT1 overexpression. We also observed that under conditions of oxidative stress, over-expression of SIRT1WT
reduced the formation of phospho-α-synuclein aggregates
and SIRT1H363Y showed a similar effect when compared
to control cells. Interestingly, SIRT1 was not seen to colocalise with phospho-α-synuclein suggesting that the
effect of SIRT1 on the aggregate formation is indirect,
independent of deacetylase activity, possibly through elevation of cellular anti-oxidant defence mechanisms.
Neurodegenerative disorders typically present pathologically with loss of neurones in the CNS. The causes of

Singh et al. BMC Neurosci (2017) 18:46

neurodegenerative disorders are still under investigation,
although environmental and known genetic risk factors
are suggested to initiate these disorders, with oxidative
stress being associated with initiation and progression of
neurodegenerative disorders [34]. SIRT1 has been shown
to modulate and repress the damage caused by oxidative
stress. In this study, no major alterations were observed
in the levels of SIRT1 protein in PD or PDD, whilst the
levels of SIRT1 showed a slight non-significant elevation
in DLB. However, in AD, the levels of SIRT1 protein were
reduced in all brain regions. Pallas et al., analysed the
expression of SIRT1 in PD (n = 3), DLB (n = 4) in the
frontal cortex compared to controls (n = 4) and observed
no changes between the groups [11]. In the current study
no major difference was seen in expression of SIRT1
protein in PD but slightly elevated levels of the protein
were observed in DLB. The inconsistencies between the
previous and current studies could possibly be explained
by group sizes with in the current study, the number of
cases being larger. A significant reduction in the level of
SIRT1 protein was observed in AD and this is most likely
explained by the greater degree of cortical atrophy seen
in AD and the loss of neuronal or synaptic SIRT1 [35]. To
further assess the role of SIRT1, activity was measured
and compared to control, with SIRT1 activity reduced in
all disease groups although no significant difference was
seen between disease groups. The lower SIRT1 activity in all disease groups correlates with possible higher
oxidative stress, synaptic and cell loss, and neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration, and also with current
findings of reduced SIRT1 levels in SH-SY5Y cells during oxidative stress (see Additional file 1: Figure S1). The
differences in enzyme activity and protein expression
may be related to the different isoforms found in brain
tissue having different enzymatic effects with some isoforms being more catalytically active than others. Studies have reported that oxidative stress and inflammation
are upregulated in neurodegenerative disorders [36, 37].
SIRT1 has been shown to alleviate the damage induced
by oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Thus, down
regulation of SIRT1 protein and activity in disease groups
could be associated with generalised neurodegeneration
observed in these disorders and the associated synaptic
and neuronal loss induced by chronic oxidative stress and
neuroinflammation.

Conclusion
In this study, we have shown that over-expression of
SIRT1 protected SH-SY5Y cells from diquat or rotenone
by down-regulating NF-кB and cPARP-1 and reducing
phospho-α-synuclein aggregates. The observed protection exerted by SIRT1 is not entirely dependent on its
deacetylase activity as the enzymatically inactive mutant

Page 12 of 13

of SIRT1 also conferred a degree of protection to cells.
In post-mortem human brain tissue, expression of SIRT1
protein did not differ markedly in Lewy body disorders
whilst reductions in SIRT1 expression was observed in
AD, though the enzymatic activity was down-regulated
in all groups compared to controls. Based upon these
findings it can be concluded that SIRT1 is a pro-survival
protein which is down-regulated under oxidative stress.
