Abstract

Author Manuscript

The microRNA (miRNA) class of small (typically 22–24 nt) non-coding RNA affects a wide range
of physiological processes in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). By acting as potent
regulators of mRNA translation and stability, miRNAs fine-tune the expression of a multitude of
genes that play critical roles in complex cognitive processes, including learning and memory. Of
note, within the CNS, miRNAs can be expressed in an inducible, and cell-type specific manner.
Here, we provide a brief overview of the expression and functional effects of the miR-132/212
gene locus in forebrain circuits of the CNS, and then discuss a recent publication that explored the
contributions of miR-132 and miR-212 to cognition and to transcriptome regulation. We also
discuss mechanisms by which synaptic activity regulates miR-132/212 expression, how miR-132
and miR-212 affect neuronal plasticity, and how the dysregulation of these two miRNAs could
contribute to the development of cognitive impairments.

The miR-132/212 gene cluster and inducible expression in the CNS

Author Manuscript

miRNAs have been shown to play a critical role in neuronal development, signaling, and
plasticity[1, 2]. As with coding genes, miRNA expression within the CNS can be tightly
regulated by changes in neuronal activity. Consistent with this, the miR-132/212 locus was
initially pulled from a screen designed to identify genes regulated by the CREB/CRE
transcriptional pathway[3], a key conduit whereby synaptic activity drives the expression of
genes that underlie neuronal plasticity and long-term memory formation[4, 5]. Using a
combination of ChIP-based profiling and DNase I footprinting assays, Vo et al. identified

two consensus CRE sites 5′ to the miR-212 transcript and a third site located between
miR-212 and miR-132[3].

Author Manuscript

In mice, the miR-132/212 gene cluster is transcribed from the first intron of a noncoding
transcript, AK006051, on Chromosome 11. In addition, an alternate transcript has also been
detected, where the miR-132/212 loci are processed from its second exon (both transcript
variants have been detected in the brain)[6]. In humans, the miR-132/212 gene cluster has
similar mature sequences and identical seed sequences to its murine homolog, but it is
located within an intergenic region, on Chromosome 17p13.3. miR-132 and miR-212 likely
resulted from gene duplication: consistent with this idea, the two miRNAs share identical 8
base seed sequences, although the flanking regions are divergent[7]. Given that miRNA basecomplementation within the seed region is a key factor in translational inhibition of target
mRNAs (reviewed in[8]), a good number of the predicted mRNA targets between miR-132
and miR-212 are redundant. However, the miRNA seed sequence flanking regions, the
folded structure of the potential mRNA target, and the molecular architecture of the target
position within the 3’ UTR also play significant roles in miRNA-mRNA hybridization and
in the efficiency of mRNA degradation and translational inhibition[9, 10]. Hence, to date, the
degree of functional redundancy between these two miRNAs is not known (discussed in
detail below).

As noted, neuronal stimulation leads to a marked increase in transcription from the
miR-132/212 locus. For example, paradigms such as photic stimulation, associative learning,
and seizure induction have all been shown to increase miR-132/212 expression in the
CNS[11–15], and, consistent with the presence of the CRE motifs, neuronal induction has
been shown to be mediated in part by the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway[3, 7].
Interestingly, an increase in miR-132 within dendrites has been detected following neuronal
stimulation and as a function of neuronal development[16, 17].

Processing, stability and functional expression of miR-132 and miR-212

Author Manuscript

Several studies have focused on the processing and stability of the pri-miR-132/212
transcript and the maturation of miR-132/212 in neurons. Notably, Remenyi et al. used a
combination of high throughput RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR profiling to show
that BDNF stimulates lasting upregulation of both miR-132-3p and miR-212-3p (and their
corresponding antisense 5p strands)[7]. However, Magill et al. used ratiometric miRNA
fluorescent reporters in immature hippocampal neurons, and found that, of the four possible
miRNAs processed from the miR-132/212 locus, only miR-132-3p exhibited functional
expression[18]. Further, Remenyi et al. recently reported that miR-132 is markedly
overexpressed relative to miR-212 in a wide variety of murine tissue types[19]. Interestingly,
this difference in miR-132 expression appears to be a consequence of the uneven processing
of the miRNAs, a result ascribed to the miR-132 loop structure and its functional interaction
with numerous RNA binding proteins, which likely leads to more efficient pri-miR-132
processing[19]. However, even with this difference in the expression of the two miRNAs, it is
still important to note that a number of studies have shown inducible miR-212 expression
and functionality within the mature nervous system[20, 21]. Clearly, additional studies will be

required to examine how miRNA expression from the miR-132/212 locus is regulated as a
function of both neuronal cell-type and development.

The role of miR-132 in synaptic plasticity and neuronal morphology

Author Manuscript

Vo et al. identified miR-132 (and characterized its CREB-regulated expression) and reported
that miR-132 regulates the outgrowth of neuronal processes[3]. This finding provided a
framework for morpho-metric-based studies that placed miR-132 into ever more complex
functional contexts (for extensive discussions of miR-132/212 in the nervous system readers
are referred to several excellent review articles[22–24]). Along these lines, abrogation of
miR-132 expression (via conditional deletion of the miR-132/212 locus or retroviral
knockdown of miR-132) led to a decrease in dendritic arborization of adult-born developing
neurons of the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus[18]. Likewise, knockdown approaches
in developing brain slices revealed that miR-132 modulates dendritic arborization[16].
Tognini et al. reported that miR-132 is induced by input to the visual cortex and that it
regulates developmentally-gated ocular dominance plasticity and neuronal spine density[25].
Finally, in the mature nervous system, transgenic overexpression of miR-132 was found to
increase spine density in CA1 dendrites[26]. These effects on neuronal morphology have
been associated with the expression of a number of miR-132 targets such as p250GAP,
MeCP2, and MMP-9[3, 16, 26, 27]. Consistent with these studies, miR-132 has been shown to
affect both basal and evoked synaptic transmission[17, 28–30]. Given the key role that activitydependent morphological and functional plasticity plays in adaptive processes such as
learning and memory, these findings raised the prospect that miR-132/212 could form a
conduit by which changes in synaptic activity modulate complex behavioral states.

miR-132/212 and the modulation of learning and memory

Author Manuscript

Having established that the miR-132/212 locus is regulated by neuronal activity, and that
miR-132 regulates key functional features of neurons (e.g., dendrite morphology and
dendrite spine density), a logical next step was to test the role of miR-132/212 in learning
and memory. To this end, Hansen et al. employed a transgenic mouse model to show that an
~ 5-fold overexpression of miR-132 in excitatory forebrain neurons leads to significant
deficits in recognition and spatial memory[26]. Consistent with this, lentiviral-based
overexpression of miR-132 in the perirhinal cortex was found to reduce recognition memory
capacity in the novel object recognition (NOR) task[31]. As with transgenic miR-132
overexpression animals, germline miR-132/212 knockout mice exhibited deficits in
recognition and spatial memory[32]. Although a similar effect with both gain-of-function and
loss-of-function approaches is, on the surface, counter-intuitive, it did raise the possibility
that the expression from the miR-132/212 locus must be maintained within a tightly
regulated range to ensure normal functionality. Indeed, when Hansen et al. returned to the
question of miR-132 and cognition, they utilized a Tet-off system to titer transgenic
miR-132 to levels that paralleled the levels observed following a learning paradigm (i.e. ~ 2fold above basal) and found that cognitive capacity was enhanced[13]. Consistent with these
findings, maintaining miR-132 within a limited/physiological range is also essential for
visual cortex plasticity. Tognini et al. showed that infusing a miR-132 mimic oligonucleotide
into the visual cortex blocked ocular dominance plasticity and increased the number of

mushroom spines[25], while Mellios et al. showed that inhibition of miR-132 not only
prevented ocular dominance plasticity after monocular deprivation, but also led to an
increase in immature spines[11]. Collectively, these studies established a functional role for
miR-132 in cognition and plasticity. However, key questions regarding the role of miR-212
in cognition had not been examined. Further, the relative contributions of miR-132 and
miR-212 to gene expression in the CNS had not been tested.

Hansen et al. (2016): miR-132/212, learning and memory, and the
hippocampal transcriptome

Author Manuscript

At this point, we turn to the recent paper by Hansen et al. that brought together a
combination of novel mouse models and RNA-seq profiling methods to assess the distinct
contributions of miR-132 and miR-212 to gene expression and to hippocampal function[33].
Again, given that both miRNAs have a common seed sequence and are expressed from the
same noncoding transcript, it has been difficult to assess the unique contribution of each
miRNA to the physiology of the forebrain.

Author Manuscript

For this study three separate mouse lines were used: a floxed miR-132/212 deletion line
where Cre recombinase was driven under the control of the CaMKII promoter (CaMKIICre::miR-132/-212f/f), and two transgenic Tet-responsive mouse lines that drive the
expression of either miR-132 or miR-212 via a CaMKII-tTA line[34] (CaMKIItTA::miR-132; CaMKII-tTA::miR-212, respectively). These approaches allowed for the
selective deletion of the miR-132/212 locus and the overexpression of each miRNA in the
same populations of excitatory forebrain neurons. Consistent with this, expression analysis
of the CaMKII-Cre::miR-132/-212f/f line and the transgenic lines confirmed that targeting
was restricted to the major excitatory cell populations of the hippocampus (e.g., CA3, CA1,
and GCL)[26, 33].
Focusing first on the cognition tests, Hansen et al. demonstrated that the deletion of the
miR-132/212 locus resulted in significant impairments in the novel object recognition task,
in the Barnes maze paradigm, and in contextual and tone fear conditioning—suggestive of
deficits in recall memory and spatial memory, respectively[33]. These data complemented
prior work by Hansen et al. showing that the transgenic overexpression of miR-132 (to levels
that approximate those observed following a learning paradigm) enhanced cognitive
capacity[13], and recent work by Hernandez-Rapp et al. who reported cognitive deficits in a
miR-132/212 knockout mouse line[32].

Author Manuscript

Turning to miR-212, to date, no study had tested its in cognition. Using the novel object
recognition task, Hansen et al. found that miR-212 transgenic mice showed a significantly
reduced capacity to discriminate between novel and familiar objects, suggesting that
miR-212 has the potential to regulate learning and memory efficacy[33]. More recently, our
lab has found that the miR-212 transgenic mouse line has a subtle anxiety phenotype
(assessed using the elevated plus maze and open field test), and deficits in spatial memory
(assessed using the Barnes maze) (unpublished observations). Importantly, in all of these
studies, expression of the miR-212 transgene was not titered with doxycycline. These results
can be viewed in multiple ways. In the most straightforward assessment, these findings

indicate that miR-212 functions as a negative regulator of recall memory, and thus, would
run counter to the findings for the targeted deletion of the miR-132/212 locus. However, this
interpretation should be viewed with a bit of caution, given prior work showing that, in the
absence of doxycycline titered transgene expression, miR-132 transgenic mice also exhibited
recall memory deficits[26]. Again, improved cognitive ability was only found after transgenic
miR-132 was titered (with doxycycline) to levels that match the induction level following a
spatial learning paradigm[13]. Thus, a similar doxycycline treatment approach may be
needed to effectively model the function of endogenous miR-212. Clearly, further work with
the miR-212 transgenic mouse line will be required to fully characterize its potential roles in
learning and memory.

Although a number of mRNA targets, including Mmp-9, p250GAP, and Mecp2, which
influence neuronal morphology[27, 3, 16, 28, 18, 26], have been described over the past several
years, there are large gaps in our understanding of the transcriptome-wide effects (both
direct targets and indirect network effects) of miR-132 and miR-212. Likewise, data
regarding the degree of target redundancy between miR-132 and miR-212 has not been
systematically examined. Hansen et al. attempted to examine these questions by harnessing
the power of RNA-seq profiling to investigate the transcriptional profiles of the three noted
mouse lines: CaMKII-Cre::miR-132/-212f/f; CaMKII-tTA::miR-132; CaMKIItTA::miR-212[33]. These datasets were then used to generate an intersectional analysis of
miR-132 and miR-212 targeted genes. The prediction from these studies was that mRNA
targets would be upregulated in miR-132/212 knockout mice and downregulated in the
transgenic overexpression animals. Logically, if the two miRNAs do exhibit target
redundancy, then the same mRNAs should be downregulated in both transgenic lines; and
conversely, non-overlapping mRNA populations would suggest functional divergence
between the miRNAs.

Author Manuscript

Hippocampal RNA-seq profiling revealed that the miR-132/212 knockout yielded 1,138
significantly upregulated transcripts and 886 significantly downregulated transcripts. In the
knockout mouse line, upregulated transcripts were viewed as potential direct targets whereas
the downregulated transcripts were most likely the result of indirect gene network effects of
the miRNAs. Transgenic overexpression of miR-132 revealed 1,266 significantly
upregulated and 928 downregulated transcripts, whereas miR-212 overexpression generated
78 upregulated and only 58 downregulated genes[33]. Ontological analysis identified a
number of functional grouping associations with synaptic transmission and neuronal
morphogenesis—both of which are thought to be key processes that underlie learning and
memory. Intersectional analysis of the upregulated dataset from the miR-132/212 knockout
line with the miR-132 predicted targets (based on datasets curated from microRNA.org), and
the downregulated RNA-seq datasets generated from the miR-132 transgenic mouse line
identified 18 genes that met the 3-way intersection criteria. Interestingly, a similar analysis
for miR-212 identified only one gene (Stx1a); downregulation of STX1A was confirmed in
the miR-212 transgenic mouse line using immunohistochemical labeling[33].
One of the most surprising findings of the RNA-seq studies was the limited number of
transcripts that were downregulated in the miR-212 transgenic mice (58), and of these, only
one transcript met the 3-way intersectional criteria (of note, 13 transcripts met a 2-way

intersectional criteria when comparing between the miR-212 transgenic mice and the
microRNA.org predicted targets). There are several possible reasons why so few targets met
the 3-way criteria. One potential factor/cause is that the mRNA profiling was performed in
mice with tonically high levels of miR-212; this high ‘baseline’ level of the transgene may
have resulted in compensatory upregulation of mRNA targets. With this in mind, a nice
addition to the study would have been to examine the mRNA profile following a transient
increase in miR-212 (this suggestion can also be applied to the examination of transgenic
miR-132). Another possibility is that miR-212 simply has limited functionality within the
hippocampus (i.e., limited miR-212 expression would result in an absence of direct targets).

Author Manuscript

With respect to the miR-132 dataset, it is worth noting that some previously validated
miR-132 targets such as p250GAP, Mmp-9, Paip2A, Sirt1, and Ptbp2 were not found to be
significantly downregulated in the RNA-seq screens. One potential reason for this could
have come from high variability across biological samples and/or limited enrichment that
kept the fold expression under the study cut-off. Certainly, other factors, including time-ofday (i.e., circadian) effects, age of the animals, and the exclusive focus on the hippocampus
could have also impacted the mRNA targeting datasets. Even with these caveats in mind, this
study provides a unique picture of the functional complexity of the miR-132/212 locus
within the hippocampus.

Future Directions

Author Manuscript

Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the expression patterns and functional
roles of miR-132 and miR-212. By virtue of their inducible expression, their ability to affect
neuronal morphology and their potential to shape learning and memory capacity, these
miRNAs are poised to play key roles in modulating the core functional features of the CNS.
Despite this growing body of knowledge, many questions remain regarding the key
characteristics and mRNA targeting properties of miR-132 and miR-212. Further,
miR-132/212 dysregulation has been associated with a number of neurodegenerative
disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease[35–37] and Huntington’s disease[38, 39], and
neurocognitive disorders, including autism[40], Rett syndrome[41], and schizophrenia[42–44].
Hence, a deeper understanding of regulation and function of miR-132 and miR-212 could
provide novel therapeutic approaches to treat an array of neurological disorders.
