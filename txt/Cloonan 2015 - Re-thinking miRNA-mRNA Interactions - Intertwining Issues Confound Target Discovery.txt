Re-thinking miRNA-mRNA interactions:
Intertwining issues confound target
discovery
Nicole Cloonan
Despite a library full of literature on miRNA biology, core issues relating to
miRNA target detection, biological effect, and mode of action remain
controversial. This essay proposes that the predominant mechanism of direct
miRNA action is translational inhibition, whereas the bulk of miRNA effects are
mRNA based. It explores several issues confounding miRNA target detection,
and discusses their impact on the dominance of miRNA seed dogma and the
exploration of non-canonical binding sites. Finally, it makes comparisons
between miRNA target prediction and transcription factor binding prediction,
and questions the value of characterizing miRNA binding sites based on which
miRNA nucleotides are paired with an mRNA.

biogenesis of mature miRNAs (roughly
22 nucleotides long) is diverse: multiple
pathways and multiple steps lead to the
generation of RNA hairpins (so named
because of the resemblance to “hair
pins” or “bobby pins;” Fig. 1). These
hairpins are further processed into a
shortened, single-stranded product,
and loaded into an AGO protein, and
the miRNA associated AGO – together
with various protein binding partners –
form the functional RISC. The entire
biogenesis pathway is highly regulated,
and has recently been reviewed in
depth [1].
By regulating the expression of
protein-coding genes, miRNAs are
involved with almost every biological
process in eukaryotes [2], and the
dysregulation of miRNA expression
has often been associated with human
disease [3, 4]. It is not surprising then,

that a substantial body of research has
been dedicated to understanding how
these miRNAs function and what their
interactions with various targets
achieves biochemically and biologically. Like most disciplines at the center
of a research frenzy, there is still
substantial debate in the field over
almost every aspect of miRNA activity,
and even how best to measure this
activity.

The predominant
mechanism of direct
miRNA action is
translational inhibition,
whereas the bulk of
miRNA effects are mRNA
based
Several mechanisms have been reported
as to how miRNAs exert their effect on
the overall protein production from
genes. The first is by interfering directly
with protein synthesis, either at the
point of initiation [5–7] or during
elongation [8, 9]. The second is by
mRNA destabilization, where the poly-A
tails of mRNA are shortened, leading to
a higher turnover of the mRNA product
by degradation [10–12]. Finally, extensive complementarity allows AGO proteins with slicer activity (only AGO2, in
humans [13]) to specifically cleave
mRNA transcripts in a manner analogous to siRNAs [14, 15]. Regardless of
which mechanism dominates, the interactions are mediated through base-

induced large-scale transcriptional
changes, well in excess of what was
observed associated with translational
inhibition [23, 24]. Genome researchers
favored a different model, based on
evidence from whole genome comparison of both mRNAs and proteins after
either increasing or decreasing the
amount of specific miRNAs [25, 26].

pairing of the target, and therefore it is
not strictly necessary to determine
which mechanism is more prevalent in
order to understand how the interaction
happens. However as the assumptions
around the dominant mechanism affect
the selection of assays to validate
miRNA-mRNA interactions, and not all
assays can detect all kinds of interactions (see “The targets you see depend
on the targets you look for”), it is useful
to examine the context in which these
conclusions have been reached.

When first investigated, it was thought
that miRNAs inhibited the translation of
proteins without affecting the level of
mRNAs [16, 17]. A large number of
biochemistry-based investigations concluded that miRNA-associated mRNA
destabilization was concurrent with
translational inhibition at the initiation
stage [10, 18–20], and that this could be
explained by sequestration of mRNAs
inhibited by miRNAs to the P-bodies,
where the silenced mRNA would be
degraded [21, 22]. Although this model

Genome editing of predicted binding sites
Probably the most definitive assay for determining
whether a miRNA and a gene interact in a cell type of
interest is to edit the genome to destroy the predicted
binding site, and compare the protein or mRNA levels
before and after editing (Fig. 2A). This method allows you
to answer the question of whether an interaction occurs
between a miRNA and an mRNA in an endogenous
context. It also has the potential to detect both translational inhibition and transcriptional degradation if protein
levels are measured. Although such a strategy has been
used [91], it is not common, because of the labour
intensiveness, expense, and inability to scale to high
throughput.
Reporter gene assays
Often considered to be the gold standard of the in vitro
assays, cloning either the entire 3’UTR or a fragment
surrounding a predicted binding site downstream of a
reporter gene (typically luciferase [41, 48], but also
fluorescent proteins [92, 93]), and then measuring the
output of that reporter in the presence or absence of a
miRNA (Fig. 2B) allows one to answer the question: is this
miRNA capable of interacting with this sequence?
Importantly, this does not reveal whether such an
interaction occurs endogenously, and unless care is taken
with the miRNA concentration and promoter selection for
the reporter, it does not reveal whether it could happen
under physiological conditions. Although this approach is
still expensive and laborious, it can be scaled to a higher
throughput than editing genomes, and has the benefit of
being agnostic to the mode of miRNA action, in that both
mRNA destabilization and translational inhibition will be
detected.
Gene-expression after miRNA modulation
After the hypothesis that miRNAs act to destabilize
mRNA was proposed, a flurry of publications used
microarray technology (Fig. 2C) to profile the effects of
miRNA modulation on the transcriptome [24, 25, 60].
Although this assay cannot distinguish between primary
and secondary transcriptional effects, and will mask any
interactions mediated by translational inhibition, depending on the specific biological question to be answered this
may not be problematic. These assays are relatively
inexpensive (for the amount of data that is returned), and
allow a global understanding of the biological pathways in
which miRNAs are involved. However, if these assays are
used to determine specific sequence motifs of interaction,
then there is likely to be a substantial amount of noise from
secondary effect genes (whose relative changes may be
greater than the original targets), hence lowering the
sensitivity of the analysis.
Degradome sequencing
Another approach used after the mRNA destabilization
hypothesis gained traction was to look at signatures left in
the transcriptome after cleavage of mRNA products – so
called “degradome sequencing” [94] (Fig. 2D). In mammals, these approaches may be slightly less informative
than assays detecting gene expression changes, because

4

.....

only one out of four AGO proteins (AGO2) has the ability to
cleave mRNA targets, although all AGOs mediate functional interactions [13, 95]. However, unlike microarrays,
this assay will allows the location of sites of cleavage on an
individual transcript, and although it will miss translationally inhibited targets as well as those where the mRNA has
been destabilized without cleavage, it will provide superior
results for examining miRNA binding sites for this specific
mode of action.
RNA immuno-purification
One of the most powerful ways to examine miRNARISC occupancy on mRNA targets is to perform Crosslinked immuno-precipitation, followed by high-throughput
sequencing (HITS-CLIP; Fig. 2E) [96–98]. The procedure is
lengthy, but elegant: (i) mRNAs and miRNA-RISC are
cross-linked by exposing intact cells to UV light; (ii)
exposed RNA regions that are not protected by protein
complexes are degraded by introducing RNases; (iii) using
an antibody to AGO2 (as the only available pan-AGO
antibody has substantial cross-reactivity to another
protein radixin [99]), RISC-miRNA-mRNA complexes are
isolated and purified; and (iv) the pool of miRNAs and
mRNA fragments are sequenced en masse. Another
protocol, PAR-CLIP [85], is conceptually similar, but differs
by feeding photoactivatable nucleosides to the cells prior
to reversible cross-linking with UV light.
While sensitive, the protocols have several shortcomings for understanding the nature of direct miRNAmRNA interactions. Firstly, the results are limited to, and
potentially biased by, the restriction of this technique to
AGO2. Although AGO2 is the only human argonaute
protein to have slicer activity [13], it is not the only
argonaute to mediate productive miRNA interactions [95].
The necessary exclusion of other argonautes from this
procedure could result in substantial biases regarding the
type of interactions that are detected. Secondly, the
protocol necessarily disassociates all miRNAs from their
mRNA targets, and therefore interactions between them
need to be computationally inferred. This obviously limits
the interactions detected to those that are assumed to
exist, and introduces substantial amounts of noise when
examining closely related miRNA species. A variant on the
HITS-CLIP method, known as CLASH [40], gets around
this problem by ligating the miRNA to the mRNA fragments
prior to sequencing, but current protocol only has very low
efficiency (< 2% of reads are miRNA/mRNA pairs) and is
likely to be biased towards longer miRNA/mRNA fragments due to steric hindrance of RISC.
Biotin-linked chromatography
More commonly referred to as a biotin pull-down
(Fig. 2F), biotin-linked chromatography involves synthesizing a miRNA duplex with the mature strand labelled with a
biotin molecule at its 30 end [100]. By transfecting this duplex
into host cells, it will incorporate into RISC and target mRNAs
in the usual manner. However, the cells can be lysed, and
RISC complexed with the target mRNAs can be captured
and purified using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads.

reduction of the corresponding transcript [26], a finding at odds with the
biochemical evidence.
Attempting to resolve this controversy, detailed experiments examining
the polysome were conducted [27, 28].
These experiments profiled both ribosome number and density (two key
parameters of translation) using microarrays [27], and RNA-seq [28], which
was a far more sensitive way to search
for changes in translation than direct
proteomics techniques. Both studies
found that translation of hundreds of
genes was directly impacted by miRNA
activity, but that the effects of translation
were relatively modest. The authors
concluded that the effects of mRNA
changes were more pronounced than
the effects on translation, and that the
predominant direct effect of miRNAs was
to cause mRNA destabilization. A major
confounder with these approaches was
the reliance upon surveying transcript
abundance without accounting for transcript isoforms [29]. Mammalian genes
produce as many as a dozen different
transcripts per locus [30], and many of
these have alternative 50 and 30 UTRs, or
alternative polyadenylation sites, none
of which were captured in the composite
measurements made by polysome profiling [27, 28]. When a set of transcripts
previously found not to be under translational control was examined in detail,
accounting for transcriptional complex-

leading to RNA changes that could confound interpretation
of these experiments. All three points have been addressed
by procedural changes. More modern versions of this
protocol [38, 49, 50] using this same miRNA did not observe
an enrichment of ribosomal mRNAs, and additionally
observed an enrichment of both miR-10a seed sites and
previously confirmed targets [38], suggesting that the Ørom
protocol had essentially failed. The very low amounts of
biotin duplex used in do not appear to substantially alter the
transcriptional landscape of the cells, as known phenotypes
of proliferative miRNAs are not observed when transfecting
at low levels [48, 49], and the transcriptome of cells
transfected with two unrelated miRNAs are indistinguishable [38]. Finally, when using high concentrations of
transfected biotin duplexes, it is possible that all highaffinity binding sites could be occupied, and the distribution
of binding could be shifted to include a higher proportion of
low-affinity binding sites. In low concentrations, we would
expect the stoichiometry to remain virtually unchanged from
the endogenous distribution.

ity, the substantial effect of translational
control became apparent [29].
Thus, as neither the “mRNA destabilization” nor “translation inhibition”
camps are able to adequately explain all
the data, the subject remains controversial. Both models have merit. For
precise and accurate control of protein
levels, it makes intuitive sense to
directly regulate translation. It also
makes sense that changes in mRNA
quantity would be a more efficient way
of driving larger changes in protein
levels with fewer resources. However,
the greatest efficiency of all would come
from not making mRNA in the first
place, rather than by making it and
silencing it, or by making it and
destroying it. A second major (but not
often discussed) confounder with these
genome-wide approaches is that they
are ultimately unable to differentiate
between primary and secondary effects.
That is, the measured changes in
mRNAs could occur because of either
a direct interaction with a miRNA, or as
a secondary consequence of a miRNA
targeting, for example, a transcription
factor. As changing the level of a
transcription factor can have dramatic
transcriptional changes within 1–2
hours [31–35], the 12 hour assay times
reported in the Guo [28] and Hendrickson [27] papers could easily be measuring indirect effects of miRNA action.
Both groups attempted to restrict their

precipitation, biotin-linked chromatography is agnostic to
whether the functional effect happens via mRNA destabilization or translational inhibition. The main advantage of this
approach is the ability to precisely identify those miRNA
targets associated with a single miRNA species, and it is
therefore the most advanced high-throughput technique for
indentifying direct interactions between individual miRNAs
and mRNAs. First used to identify the mechanism of action of
siRNAs [101–105], and later adapted to the task of target
identification [100, 106], this protocol is easily the most
controversial in the field.
There are three major concerns that are typically (and
correctly) voiced about this procedure [107]: (i) that the
pull-down of miR-10a by Ørom et al. [106] did not enrich for
either transcripts with miR-10a seed sites or transcripts
known to be targets of this miRNA; (ii) that the dramatic
over-expression of an exogenous miRNA could alter the
stoichiometry of detected miRNA-mRNA interactions; and
(iii) that the dramatic over-expression of an exogenous
miRNA could alter the transcriptional network of the cells,

analyses only direct interactions using
the presence of a seed site (see The
Dominance of the Seed Site), and while
this is the best marker we have for
predicting genuine miRNA targets,
these predictions are notoriously inaccurate, being wrong more often than
they are right (when you include
false negatives [36–40] as well as false
positives [41–43]).
If we assume that there are both
direct and indirect transcriptional consequences of miRNA modulation, then it
becomes easy to envisage a model
where all genomic and biochemical
data is accounted for. The predominant
direct effect of a miRNA would be
through
translational
inhibition,
whereas the predominant indirect effect
would affect protein levels through
large-scale transcriptional regulation.
If such a model were true, we would
expect that miRNAs predominantly
target genes encoding transcription
factors. Indeed, an early study into
predicted miRNA targets seems to support this, finding that nuclear signaling
components were significantly more
likely to be targets of a miRNA than
cell surface or extracellular signaling
components [44], whilst other studies
find enrichment for transcriptional regulators amongst the targets of miRNAs
[38, 45–49] (including the Hendrickson
study [27]). This evidence supports the
hypothesis that the major direct effect of

5

N. Cloonan

miRNA action is to inhibit translation,
but the bulk of miRNA effects come from
changing the transcriptional landscape.

The targets you see
depend on the targets you
look for
Understanding the predominant mode of
action for miRNAs has substantial implications for the methodology used to
determine direct interacting mRNA partners, and subsequently determining their
mode of binding. However, having a
robust understanding of the mode
of miRNA binding is unequivocally
required in order to understand the
predominant mode of action and identifying miRNA targets. Thus, the relationship between the concepts is often
circular, and a cause for confusion –
teasing apart the limitations of each
technology (Box 1) allows us to evaluate
the results that are generated from them.
For indirect assays (those that measure
the effect of the miRNA, not the
interaction itself), methodologies that
rely on the detection of a protein make
fewer assumptions about the predominant mode of action than those that
rely on the detection of mRNAs. If
protein levels are measured, then
changes by either mRNA destabilization
or translational inhibition can be
detected; however, if only mRNA levels
are measured, translational inhibition
will not be detected. A second confounder is trying to distinguish between
primary and secondary effects of miRNA
action. Experimental designs that look
only at correlative changes (such as
microarray profiling; Box 1), will have a
lower sensitivity when determining
specific sequence motifs of interactions
due to secondary miRNA effects.
Direct assays are not without their
problems either. Methods such as HITSCLIP (Box 1) are by far and away the most
sensitive way to understand where
endogenous miRNA binding sites are
located on an mRNA transcript. However,
the analysis of binding site types relies on
computational inference because the
miRNA-mRNA relationship is not preserved in the protocol. On the other hand,
biotin-linked chromatography (Box 1),
while preserving the miRNA-mRNA relationship, necessarily involves the use of

an exogenous molecule. This limits the
protocol to cells that are easily transfectable, and has the potential to alter
both the transcriptional profile of the
cells and the distribution of occupied
miRNA binding sites if the amount of
exogenous miRNA is not very low [50].
Some researchers have also highlighted
the potential of direct-assay technologies
to form a specific type of false positive,
where complexes between RNA and
proteins form after cell lysis [51, 52]. In
preliminary experiments, human cells
were independently transfected with an
EBV miRNA not normally expressed in
cells, and a labeled AGO protein. Both cell
populations were then mixed after lysis,
and co-immunoprecipitations identified
interactions between the two molecules
that could not have happened in the
cells [51]. However, the authors chose to
use detergent at ten-times less than is
required to prevent non-specific association of rRNA [38], so it is unclear
whether these interactions were specific
or not. Regardless, it is standard scientific
rigor to validate scientific claims by
multiple methods, and orthogonal
approaches should be used to increase
confidence in the findings. Deciding
upon appropriate techniques will
depend very much on the specific biological question that needs to be
answered, and what level of precision
is required to answer it.

What is a target anyway?
It is essential to realize that both
stoichiometry and stochasticity have
critical roles to play in the translation
of target interactions to biological effect.
Although we think about interactions
happening at the level of individual
miRNAs and mRNAs, spending a great
deal of time worrying about the exact
nucleotides involved, we typically define
miRNA targets based on phenomenological effects from a population of cells. It is
certainly possible that miRNAs can
interact with a transcript without causing
a repressive effect – similar results have
been observed with transcription factors
due either to limiting concentrations of
required cellular co-factors, or to inherent non-productive (or redundant) binding [53–57]. Even if the miRNA binding is
productive, full or partial inhibition of
individual transcripts does not mean that

.....

the overall level of a protein changes
substantially. Cells only need to increase
the level of mRNA to overcome the effect
of miRNA targeting [48, 58]. Finally,
repression of an individual protein
does not necessarily alter the biological
trajectory of a cell or tissue. These
considerations mean that the definition
of a miRNA target becomes somewhat
fuzzy. However, until the technology for
analyzing these aspects of miRNA biology becomes more robust, the working
definition of miRNA targets (any detectable and stably interacting mRNA) will
need to suffice.
Studying individual cells rather
than populations may help us tease
apart these issues. Although restricted
to exogenous interactions, studies at the
single cell level revealed a threshold of
mRNA expression beyond which miRNA
inhibition of protein production became
less efficient [58], presumably by the
sequestration of all available active and
compatible RISC. In a given population
of cells, this means that the underlying
variation in mRNA expression could
lead to substantially different levels of
proteins in different cells.
It is unclear how much this stochasticity has impacted the determination of
miRNA targets to date. On the one hand, it
implies that dramatic over-expression of
miRNA could alter the stoichiometric
ratio so that all high-affinity binding sites
could be occupied. This would mean the
distribution of interactions could be
shifted to include low-affinity sites that
might not otherwise be targeted, generating false positives. On the other hand,
reporter assays also typically overexpress non-endogenous transcripts
driven by strong promoters, which could
either negate the effect of miRNA overexpression, or even lead to false negatives
if care is not taken with the experimental
design. Understanding the variation of
both miRNAs and mRNAs at the single
cell level can help to better define the
parameters of miRNA targeting [59].

Experimental protocols
reveal alternative modes
of interaction
The relatively poor performance of prediction algorithms and the recent availability of high-throughput approaches
have driven the experimental exploration of non-seed mediated miRNA –
target interactions (Fig. 3). Using
“orphan” HITS-CLIP data (RISC binding
sites where there was no match to a
miRNA seed site), Chi et al. [37] were able
to identify an enrichment of sites containing an extra G in the mRNA between
positions five and six of the miRNA.
These “G-bulge” sites were not unexpected, having previously been shown as
possible in a DNA-based experiment [84],
but their occupancy of 15% of binding
sites was previously unappreciated. Nonseed interactions were also explored
using motifs enriched above background
in PAR-CLIP data [85], finding relatively
infrequent (<7%) instances of seed
mismatches and bulges in the seed
region, and weak enrichment of four
nucleotide matches to positions 13–15 of

the miRNA. In both studies, the results
were confounded by the necessary inference of miRNA binding sites (see Box 1,
“RNA immuno-purification”), an area
addressed by a genetically controlled
differential HITS-CLIP experiment where
miR-155 knock-out cells were compared
with wild-type miR-155 cells [86]. This
experiment showed greatly increased
sensitivity for non-seed sites, revealing
that 40% of sites were mediated by noncanonical interactions. The evolutionary
conservation of the central region of
miRNAs [60] prompted the search for
“centered sites,” and Shin et al. [87]
reported that the rare (<5% prevalence)
11nt sites with perfect Watson-Crick
complementarity to mRNAs were functional, but that the more abundant sites
containing mismatches or GU wobble
were not. In this case, poor selection of
the target validation method (microarrays after miRNA modulation) based
on the assumption that most targets
would have destabilized mRNA masked
the functionality of these far more
common sites (up to 50% of all miRNAmiRNA interactions). Imperfectly centered sites were eventually discovered to

2–8 in the 50 end of a miRNA, called the
“seed” region.
Even though the first miRNA binding
sites reported were not true seed sites [17,
36, 60, 61], seeds were found to have
more predictive value for finding miRNA
targets than any other interaction type [2,
43, 62], and the 50 region of the miRNAs
were more conserved than any other
region. As experimental techniques of
the time were both laborious and
expensive (see “The targets you see
depend on the targets you look for”),
quite reasonably, experimental validation has focused around those interactions most likely to yield positive results,
leading to a positive reinforcement in the
literature dominance of the seed site.
However, the presence of a seed site in a
mRNA does not guarantee occupancy by
a given miRNA even when that miRNA is
over-expressed [63], and even the best
prediction algorithms have false positive
rates of between 20–50% [25, 26, 43, 48].
It’s important to note that target prediction programs restrict the output of
their programs to increase the accuracy
of their predictions, and whilst some
restrictions are modeled on biology,
others are modeled on abstractions that
are unlikely to reflect what actually
happens on the inside of a cell. For
example, filtering predicted targets
based on the folding structure of the
mRNA [64–71] is likely to model something that happens in a cell, because
RISC will be unable to access binding
sites that are hidden away in a 3D
structure. In contrast, RISC has no means
to assess the evolutionary conservation
of a given miRNA binding site in situ.
While filters based on comparative
genomics approaches [2, 43, 69, 70,
72–75] can tell us a lot about the
similarities of miRNA networks within
an evolutionary clade, the relevance for
rapidly evolving or recently acquired
miRNAs is substantially less [76]. Additional problems with the restriction of
target output related to the use of shorter
RefSeq 3’UTRs when very often UTRs are
substantially longer [77], and many
functional miRNA binding sites exist
outside of the 3’UTR [39, 46, 78–82].
Therefore, whilst seeds in the 3’UTRs of
genes make up the vast majority of
validated target sites in the literature,
this is largely the result of an early
entrenched software bias rather than a
biological requirement [83].

be functional using more suitable biotinlinked chromatography and reporter
assay validation [38].
Together these studies highlight the
vast array of non-canonical miRNAmRNA interactions, and strongly hint
that the variability of functional interacting sites is far more extreme than first
indicated by comparative genomics
studies. It is not unreasonable to
consider the possibility that any accessible six nucleotides, whether contiguous in the mRNA or not, is capable of
mediating a functional interaction with
a miRNA.

There is little value in the
classification of binding
site combinatorics
Regardless of the progress made into the
exploration of non-seed sites, it remains
true that the predictive power of the
various new categories is likely to be
very small [2, 38, 43, 62]. Although some
have argued that a lack of predictive
power for non-canonical seed sites casts
doubt upon the biological validity of
such interactions [42], this seems like a
bold call considering the strength of the
accompanying biological validation,
and that our understanding of how
RISC occupancy correlates with the
strength of an interaction is far from
complete [25].
Interesting parallels can be drawn
between the prediction of miRNA targets and the prediction of transcription
factor binding sites. Both are attempting
to discern very short regulatory signals
in a large amount of statistical noise,
and both are trying to model the truth in
a biological system when that truth is
not yet understood [88]. It is therefore
noteworthy to observe a strong shift
away from using computational techniques to predict transcription factor
binding sites and guide experimental
validation to instead using computational techniques to understand the
signals from less biased high-throughput techniques such as ChIP-seq [88–
90]. As the tools for dissecting miRNA
targets become more sophisticated and
more widely accepted, it seems probable that the miRNA field will head in
the same direction. When this happens,
the value of classifying the different

8

Insights & Perspectives

types of miRNA binding sites based on
which miRNA nucleotides are involved
will be questionable.

Conclusions and outlook
One thing that is becoming clear with
the uncovering of these different interaction types is that miRNAs stably
interact with hundreds to thousands
of mRNAs, and some consideration
needs to be given to separating biological noise from functionally-driven
signal. Differentiating direct from indirect consequences of miRNA action
makes it easier to specifically examine
the mechanisms by which miRNAs
interact with their mRNA targets, but
this requires more scientific rigor if it is
to disentangle the functional consequences of those interactions. Issues
of miRNA target detection and miRNA
mode of action are intertwined with
discussion of the major effect and roles
of miRNAs in the cell. And, as our
understanding of miRNA biology
improves, so too will our ability to
predict and model target interactions.
Although prediction tools have strongly
dictated the way we studied miRNAs in
the past, their relevancy will change as
our repertoire of experimental tools
improve. This will in turn shape our
understanding of how, where, and why
miRNAs function, ideally converging on
a model that incorporates all of the data,
not just those that are convenient.
