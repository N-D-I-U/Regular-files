ABSTRACT
Objective: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive
neurological disorder characterised by a large number of
motor and non-motor features that can impact on function
to a variable degree. This review describes the clinical
characteristics of PD with emphasis on those features
that differentiate the disease from other parkinsonian
disorders.
Methods: A MedLine search was performed to identify
studies that assess the clinical characteristics of PD.
Search terms included ‘‘Parkinson’s disease’’, ‘‘diagnosis’’
and ‘‘signs and symptoms’’.
Results: Because there is no definitive test for the
diagnosis of PD, the disease must be diagnosed based on
clinical criteria. Rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and loss
of postural reflexes are generally considered the cardinal
signs of PD. The presence and specific presentation of
these features are used to differentiate PD from related
parkinsonian disorders. Other clinical features include
secondary motor symptoms (eg, hypomimia, dysarthria,
dysphagia, sialorrhoea, micrographia, shuffling gait,
festination, freezing, dystonia, glabellar reflexes), nonmotor symptoms (eg, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive/
neurobehavioral abnormalities, sleep disorders and sensory abnormalities such as anosmia, paresthesias and
pain). Absence of rest tremor, early occurrence of gait
difficulty, postural instability, dementia, hallucinations, and
the presence of dysautonomia, ophthalmoparesis, ataxia
and other atypical features, coupled with poor or no
response to levodopa, suggest diagnoses other than PD.
Conclusions: A thorough understanding of the broad
spectrum of clinical manifestations of PD is essential to
the proper diagnosis of the disease. Genetic mutations or
variants, neuroimaging abnormalities and other tests are
potential biomarkers that may improve diagnosis and
allow the identification of persons at risk.

In his 1817 ‘‘An essay on the shaking palsy’’, James
Parkinson first described the clinical syndrome that
was later to bear his name.1 He identified six cases,
three of whom he personally examined; three he
observed on the streets of London. Previously
referred to as ‘‘paralysis agitans’’, Charcot later in
the 19th century gave credit to Parkinson by
referring to the disease as ‘‘maladie de Parkinson’’
or Parkinson’s disease (PD). Charcot also recognised non-tremulous forms of PD and correctly
pointed out that slowness of movement should be
distinguished from weakness or ‘‘lessened muscular
power’’, a term originally used by Parkinson.2 More
than 100 years passed (1919) after the original
description by Parkinson before it was recognised
that patients with PD lose cells in the substantia
nigra, and 140 years passed (1957) before dopamine was discovered as a putative neurotransmitter by Carlsson and colleagues in Lund, Sweden.3
The discovery by Ehringer and Hornykiewicz in
368

19603 4 that dopamine concentrations are markedly
decreased in the striatum of patients with PD
paved the way for the first trials of levodopa in PD
patients the following year5 and subsequent award
of the Nobel Prize in Medicine to Carlsson in 2000.
The ability of injected levodopa to improve
akinesia in patients with PD was first demonstrated in 1961 and was followed by the development of oral levodopa later in the decade.6 7 More
recently, genetic mutations, abnormal handling of
misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin–proteasome
and the autophagy–lysosomal systems, increased
oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction,
inflammation and other pathogenic mechanisms
have been identified as contributing factors in the
death of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cells
in the brains of patients with PD.8 9 It is beyond
the scope of this review to discuss the various
pathogenic mechanisms, management or treatment related complications that have been the
subjects of recent reviews and volumes.10 11 This
article focuses on the clinical features of PD and the
differentiation of the disease from other parkinsonian disorders.

CLINICAL FEATURES
There are four cardinal features of PD that can be
grouped under the acronym TRAP: Tremor at rest,
Rigidity, Akinesia (or bradykinesia) and Postural
instability. In addition, flexed posture and freezing
(motor blocks) have been included among classic
features of parkinsonism, with PD as the most
common form. Because of the diverse profiles and
lifestyles of those affected by PD, motor and nonmotor impairments should be evaluated in the
context of each patient’s needs and goals.12
A number of rating scales are used for the
evaluation of motor impairment and disability in
patients with PD, but most of these scales have not
been fully evaluated for validity and reliability.13 14
The Hoehn and Yahr scale is commonly used to
compare groups of patients and to provide gross
assessment of disease progression, ranging from
stage 0 (no signs of disease) to stage 5 (wheelchair
bound or bedridden unless assisted). The Unified
Parkinson’s Disease Rating scale (UPDRS) is the
most well established scale for assessing disability
and impairment.13 15 Studies making use of UPDRS
to track the progression of PD suggest that the
course of PD is not linear and that the rate of
deterioration is variable and more rapid in the early
phase of the disease and in patients with the
postural instability gait difficulty (PIGD) of PD.16–18
We prospectively followed-up 297 patients (181
men, 116 women) with clinically diagnosed PD for
at least 3 years and, based on data from 1731 visits
during an average of 6.36 years (range 3–17), we
concluded that the annual rate of decline in the

Review
total UPDRS scores was 1.34 points when assessed during ON
and 1.58 points when assessed during OFF. Patients who were
older and had the PIGD form of PD at onset experienced more
rapid disease progression than did those who were younger at
onset and had the tremor dominant form of PD. Furthermore,
the older group experienced significantly more progression in
mentation, freezing and parts I and II UPDRS subscores.
Handwriting was the only component of the UPDRS that did
not significantly deteriorate during the observation period. On
the other hand, many studies have shown that younger patients
are at a higher risk for levodopa induced dyskinesias than older
patients.19 In a prospective study of 145 clinic based patients
followed-up for 1 year and of 124 community based patients
followed-up for 4 years, the annual mean rate of deterioration
in motor and disability scores ranged from 2.4% to 7.4%.20 The
current UPDRS is undergoing revisions so that the revised scale
will be more sensitive to detect small changes and it will
integrate non-motor elements of PD.15 Other types of rating
scales include those that assess psychiatric manifestations (eg,
depression)21 and quality of life.14 21 The most frequent clinical
features associated with PD are listed in table 1 and are
discussed in the following sections.

Bradykinesia
Bradykinesia refers to slowness of movement and is the most
characteristic clinical feature of PD, although it may also be seen
in other disorders, including depression. Bradykinesia is a
hallmark of basal ganglia disorders, and it encompasses
difficulties with planning, initiating and executing movement
and with performing sequential and simultaneous tasks.22 The
initial manifestation is often slowness in performing activities
of daily living and slow movement and reaction times.23 24 This
may include difficulties with tasks requiring fine motor control
(eg, buttoning, using utensils). Other manifestations of
bradykinesia include loss of spontaneous movements and
gesturing, drooling because of impaired swallowing,25 monotonic and hypophonic dysarthria, loss of facial expression
(hypomimia) and decreased blinking, and reduced arm swing
while walking. Given that bradykinesia is one of the most easily
recognisable symptoms of PD, it may become apparent before
any formal neurological examination. Assessment of bradykinesia usually includes having patients perform rapid, repetitive, alternating movements of the hand (finger taps, hand
grips, hand pronation–supination) and heel taps and observing
not only slowness but also decrementing amplitude.
In common with other parkinsonian symptoms, bradykinesia
is dependent on the emotional state of the patient. For example,
immobile patients who become excited may be able to make
quick movements such as catching a ball (or may be able to
suddenly run if someone screams ‘‘fire’’). This phenomenon
(kinesia paradoxica) suggests that patients with PD have intact

motor programmes but have difficulties accessing them without
an external trigger, such as a loud noise, marching music or a
visual cue requiring them to step over an obstacle.
Although the pathophysiology of bradykinesia has not been
well delineated, it is the cardinal PD feature that appears to
correlate best with degree of dopamine deficiency.26 This is
supported by the observation of decreased neuronal density in
the substantia nigra in elderly patients with parkinsonism
regardless of PD diagnosis.27 In addition, positron emission
tomography in patients with PD has demonstrated that the
decreased 18F-fluorodopa uptake in the striatum and accumbens–caudate complex is proportional to the degree of
bradykinesia.28
It is hypothesised that bradykinesia is the result of a
disruption in normal motor cortex activity mediated by reduced
dopaminergic function. In a study assessing recordings from
single cortical neurons in rats with haloperidol induced
bradykinesia, a decrease in firing rates correlated with bradykinesia.29 Functional neuroimaging studies also suggest impairment in the recruitment of cortical and subcortical systems that
regulate kinematic parameters of movement (eg, velocity).30
Conversely, recruitment of various premotor areas, such as
those responsible for visuomotor control, is increased.30
Anatomically, the deficit appears to be localised in the putamen
and globus pallidus,28 resulting in a reduction in the muscle force
produced at the initiation of movement. Analysis of electromyographic recordings showed that patients with bradykinesia
are unable to energise the appropriate muscles to provide
enough force to initiate and maintain large fast movements.31
Because patients with PD have decreased electromyographic
activity,22 they need a series of multiple agonist bursts to
accomplish larger movements.

Tremor
Rest tremor is the most common and easily recognised
symptom of PD. Tremors are unilateral, occur at a frequency
between 4 and 6 Hz, and almost always are prominent in the
distal part of an extremity. Hand tremors are described as
supination–pronation (‘‘pill-rolling’’) tremors that spread from
one hand to the other. Rest tremor in patients with PD can also
involve the lips, chin, jaw and legs but, unlike essential tremor,
rarely involves the neck/head or voice. Thus a patient who
presents with head tremor most likely has essential tremor,
cervical dystonia, or both, rather than PD. Characteristically,
rest tremor disappears with action and during sleep. Some
patients also report an ‘‘internal’’ shaking that is not associated
with a visible tremor.32 The tremor of PD is differentiated from
that of essential tremor by a number of features (table 2).
Some patients with PD have a history of postural tremor,
phenomenologically identical to essential tremor, for many
years or decades before the onset of parkinsonian tremor or

other PD related features. We and others have provided a
growing body of evidence that indicates that essential tremor is
a risk factor for PD.33
In addition to rest tremor, many patients with PD also have
postural tremor that is more prominent and disabling than rest
tremor and may be the first manifestation of the disease.34 35
Parkinson’s related postural tremor (‘‘re-emergent tremor’’) is
differentiated from essential tremor in that the appearance of
tremor is often delayed after the patient assumes an outstretched horizontal position.34 Because re-emergent tremor
occurs at the same frequency as classical rest tremor and is
responsive to dopaminergic therapy, it is likely that it represents
a variant of the more typical rest tremor. There are several clues
to the diagnosis of existent essential tremor when it coexists
with PD, including longstanding history of action tremor,
family history of tremor, head and voice tremor, and no latency
when arms are outstretched in a horizontal position in front of
the body, although some patients may also have a re-emergent
tremor related to their PD, tremulous handwriting and spiral,
and improvement of the tremor with alcohol and beta-blockers.
The occurrence of rest tremor is variable among patients and
during the course of the disease. In one study, Hughes and
colleagues36 reported that 69% of patients with PD had rest
tremor at disease onset and that 75% had tremor during the
course of their disease. Tremor was lost in 9% of patients late in
the disease. Others have reported that a small proportion of
patients (11%) never have tremor,37 although a prospective
study in patients with autopsy proven disease found that 100%
of patients had tremor at some point.38 Clinical–pathological
studies have demonstrated that patients with PD and prominent tremor have degeneration of a subgroup of midbrain (A8)
neurons, whereas this area is spared in PD patients without
tremor.

Rigidity
Rigidity is characterised by increased resistance, usually
accompanied by the ‘‘cogwheel’’ phenomenon, particularly
when associated with an underlying tremor, present throughout
370

the range of passive movement of a limb (flexion, extension or
rotation about a joint). It may occur proximally (eg, neck,
shoulders, hips) and distally (eg, wrists, ankles). Reinforcing
manoeuvres (eg, voluntary movements of the contralateral
limb), known as the Froment’s manoeuvre,39 usually increase
rigidity and are particularly useful in detecting mild cases of
rigidity.
Rigidity may be associated with pain, and painful shoulder is
one of the most frequent initial manifestations of PD although
it is commonly misdiagnosed as arthritis, bursitis or rotator cuff
injury.40 41 A prospective study of 6038 persons (mean age
68.5 years) with no evidence of dementia or parkinsonism at
baseline found that the presence of stiffness, tremor and
imbalance were each associated with increased risk for PD
(hazard ratios 2.11, 2.09 and 3.47, respectively).42 Among this
cohort, 56 new cases of PD were identified over a mean followup of 5.8 years.

Postural deformities
In addition, rigidity of the neck and trunk (axial rigidity) may
occur, resulting in abnormal axial postures (eg, anterocollis,
scoliosis). Postural deformities resulting in flexed neck and
trunk posture and flexed elbows and knees are often associated
with rigidity. However, flexed posture generally occurs late in
the disease. Striatal limb deformities (eg, striatal hand, striatal
toe) may also develop in some patients. Striatal hand is
characterised by ulnar deviation of the hands, flexion of the
metacarpophalangeal joints and extension of the proximal and
flexion of the distal interphalangeal joints (fig 1A); striatal foot
is characterised by extension or flexion (fig 1B) of the toes.43 44 In
one study, striatal toe (extension of the big toe) was reported in
21% of patients with clinically diagnosed PD.45 Patients with
striatal deformities tend to be younger and to experience earlier
onset of initial parkinsonian symptoms.44
Other skeletal abnormalities include extreme neck flexion
(‘‘dropped head’’ or ‘‘bent spine’’), truncal flexion (camptocormia) and scoliosis.44 46–48 Camptocormia is characterised by
extreme flexion of the thoracolumbar spine. The condition is

Review
exacerbated by walking and is relieved by sitting, lying in the
supine position or by volitionally extending the trunk when the
patient leans against a wall or a high walker or a table (fig 2A–
C).48 In addition to PD, other causes of camptocormia include
dystonia and extensor truncal myopathy.49 50 Another truncal
deformity is the Pisa syndrome, which is characterised by a
tilting of the trunk, particularly when sitting or standing.51

Postural instability
Postural instability due to loss of postural reflexes is generally a
manifestation of the late stages of PD and usually occurs after
the onset of other clinical features. The pull test, in which the
patient is quickly pulled backward or forward by the shoulders,
is used to assess the degree of retropulsion or propulsion,
respectively. Taking more than two steps backwards or the
absence of any postural response indicates an abnormal postural
response. Postural instability (along with freezing of gait) is the
most common cause of falls and contributes significantly to the
risk of hip fractures.52 The long latency to the onset of falls
differentiates PD from other neurodegenerative disorders, such
as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple systems
atrophy (MSA).53 In one study, the average time from onset of
symptoms to the first fall was 108 months in patients with PD
compared with 16.8 and 42 months, respectively, in patients
with PSP and MSA.52
Several other factors also influence the occurrence of postural
instability in patients with PD. These include other parkinsonian symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, age related sensory
changes and the ability to integrate visual, vestibular and
proprioceptive sensory input (kinesthesia).54 55 The fear of falling
can further impair balance control in patients with PD.56 In one
study, 38% of those evaluated experienced falls, and 13% fell
more than once a week.57 As expected, the frequency of falls
correlated with the severity of disease.57 Treatment (dopaminergic therapy, pallidotomy, deep brain stimulation) can
improve some axial signs58 but usually does not robustly
improve postural instability, measured by platform tilt and
visual tilt.59 Targeting other nuclei for deep brain stimulation in
addition to the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus, such as
the zona incerta and pedunculopontine nucleus, is being

explored as a potential surgical treatment of gait difficulties
and postural stability.60

Freezing
Freezing, also referred to as motor blocks, is a form of akinesia
(loss of movement) and is one of the most disabling symptoms
of PD.61 Although freezing is a characteristic feature of PD, it
does not occur universally.62 Based on responses by 6620
patients to a questionnaire sent to 12 000 members of the
German Parkinson Association, 47% of patients reported
freezing; it occurs more frequently in men than in women
and less frequently in patients whose main symptom is
tremor.63 Freezing most commonly affects the legs during
walking, but the arms and eyelids can also be involved.64 It
typically manifests as a sudden and transient (usually ,10 s)
inability to move. This may include hesitation when beginning
to walk (start hesitation) or a sudden inability to move the feet
during specific situations (eg, turning or walking through a
narrow passage, crossing busy streets, approaching a destination). Freezing is associated with substantial social and clinical
consequences for patients. In particular, it is a common cause of
falls.62
Five subtypes of freezing have been described: start hesitation, turn hesitation, hesitation in tight quarters, destination
hesitation and open space hesitation.65 Episodes are more severe
in the OFF state and are mitigated by levodopa therapy. In
addition, patients often develop tricks to overcome freezing
attacks. This includes marching to command, stepping over

Review
objects (eg, a walking stick, cracks in the floor), walking to
music or a beat, and shifting body weight.66–68
Risk factors for the development of freezing include the
presence of rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability and longer
disease duration.61 In contrast, tremor at disease onset is
associated with a decreased risk of freezing. As freezing typically
occurs later in the course of the disease or is not the
predominant symptom, alternative diagnoses should be considered when these presentations occur. Freezing, particularly
when it occurs during the ON period, does not usually respond
to dopaminergic therapy, but patients treated with selegiline
have been found to be at lower risk.69 Botulinum toxin
injections, although effective for a variety of parkinsonian
symptoms such as tremors, dystonia and sialorrhoea, have not
been found consistently effective in the treatment of freezing.70

Other motor abnormalities
Patients with PD may exhibit a number of secondary motor
symptoms that may impact on their functioning at home, at
work and while driving.71 Because of a breakdown of the frontal
lobe inhibitory mechanisms, some patients display a reemergence of primitive reflexes.72 73 One study that included
41 patients with PD found that the primitive glabellar reflex
was present in 80.5% of patients.74 This symptom was a
moderately sensitive (83.3%) indicator of a parkinsonian
disorder but was not specific (47.5%) for PD. Patients with
PD in this study also experienced an increased frequency
(34.1%) of the palmomental reflex. This symptom was not
sensitive (33.3%) but was more specific (90%) than the glabellar
reflex. In addition, these primitive reflexes cannot differentiate
among the three most common parkinsonian disorders (PD,
PSP, MSA).74 Similarly, the ‘‘applause sign’’, initially thought to
be specific for PSP, is frequently present in other parkinsonian
disorders, particularly corticobasal degeneration.75 In some
cases, unintended movements accompany voluntary activity
in homologous muscles on the opposite side of the body. These
so-called mirror movements may be observed in early asymmetric PD.76
Bulbar dysfunction manifested by dysarthria, hypophonia,
dysphagia and sialorrhoea, frequently observed in patients with
PD, can be equally or even more disabling than the cardinal
features. These symptoms are thought to be related to
orofacial–laryngeal bradykinesia and rigidity.77 Speech disorders
in patients with PD are characterised by monotonous, soft and
breathy speech with variable rate and frequent word finding
difficulties, referred to as ‘‘tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon.’’78 79
Speech therapy, such as the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment,80
that emphasises efforts to improve the volume and quality of
the speech, may ameliorate the symptoms of dysarthria.
Dysphagia is usually caused by an inability to initiate the
swallowing reflex or by a prolongation of laryngeal or
oesophageal movement. Dysphagia is often subclinical, particularly in the early course of the disease.81 PD related drooling may
result from a decrease in swallowing.25
A number of neuro-ophthalmological abnormalities may be
seen in patients with PD. These include decreased blink rate,
ocular surface irritation, altered tear film, visual hallucinations,
blepharospasm and decreased convergence.82 The degree of
abnormality in ocular pursuit and saccades as well as
antisaccades83 is related to the degree of disease progression.84
Dopaminergic therapy generally improves these changes, but
one study found no difference in smooth ocular pursuit
between ON and OFF periods in patients with PD.85 Other
neuro-ophthalmological abnormalities associated with PD
372

include apraxia of eyelid opening, limitation of upward gaze
and oculogyric crises.86 87
Respiratory disturbances in patients with PD can be
restrictive or obstructive.88 These complications are associated
with substantial morbidity and mortality; pneumonia is an
independent predictor of mortality in nursing home patients
with PD.89 The obstructive pattern may be related to rigidity,
cervical arthrosis or restricted range of motion in the neck, and
the restrictive pattern may be related to chest wall rigidity.90
Respiration may also be compromised by levodopa related
respiratory dyskinesia in patients with PD.91

Non-motor features
Non-motor symptoms are a common and under appreciated
feature of PD.92 These include autonomic dysfunction, cognitive/neurobehavioral disorders, and sensory and sleep abnormalities.

Autonomic dysfunction
Autonomic failure may be the presenting feature of PD,
although it is more typically associated with MSA. Features
include orthostatic hypotension, sweating dysfunction,93
sphincter dysfunction and erectile dysfunction.94 95 A community based study found that 47% (42/89) of PD patients met the
diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension.96

Cognitive and neurobehavioural abnormalities
Neuropsychiatric disturbances can be as disabling as motor
symptoms. The Sydney Multicenter Study of PD found that
84% of patients evaluated showed cognitive decline and that
48% met the diagnostic criteria for dementia after 15 years of
follow-up.97 Another community based prospective study found
that patients with PD are at almost sixfold increased risk for
dementia.98 PD related dementia is also associated with a
number of other neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Among 537
such patients, depression (58%), apathy (54%), anxiety (49%)
and hallucinations (44%) were frequently reported.99 In a study
of 114 patients with PD, 27.6% screened positive for depression
during the average 14.6 months of follow-up; 40% were neither
treated with antidepressants nor referred for further psychiatric
evaluation.100 In addition to cognitive and affective disorders,
many patients with PD exhibit features of obsessive–compulsive
and impulsive behaviour, such as craving (especially for
sweets),101 binge eating, compulsive foraging, hypersexuality,
pathological gambling, compulsive shopping and punding,
characterised by intense fascination with repetitive handling,
examining, sorting and arranging of objects.102 These behavioural symptoms, sometimes referred to as ‘‘hedonistic
homeostatic dysregulation’’, have been attributed to dopamine
dysregulation syndrome associated with the use of dopaminergic drugs, particularly dopamine agonists, but the mechanism of
these aberrant behaviours is not well understood.103 Cognitive
and behavioural dysfunction in PD is not well understood, and
its discussion is beyond the scope of this article; the reader is
referred to some recent reviews of this topic.104

Sleep disorders
Although sleep disturbances (eg, excessive sleepiness, sleep
attacks) were once largely attributed to the pharmacological
therapy for PD,105 some clinicians now believe that these
features are an integral part of the disease.106 This is supported
by the observation that rapid eye movement sleep behaviour
disorder, which occurs in approximately one-third of patients

yelling, swearing, grabbing, punching, kicking, jumping and
other dramatic, violent and potentially injurious motor activity
which may also involve the bed partner. Insomnia, particularly
sleep fragmentation, is also frequent (.50% prevalence), but the
occurrence is highly variable among patients.111 112 The sleep
abnormalities observed in patients with PD may possibly be
related to a 50% loss of hypocretin (orexin) neurons.113 114 Although
excessive daytime sleepiness may contribute to fatigue, this
common symptom is also seen independently of sleepiness.115

Sensory abnormalities
Sensory symptoms such as olfactory dysfunction, pain, paresthesia, akathisia, oral pain and genital pain are frequent but
are often not recognised as parkinsonian symptoms.41 116–121 One
study found that olfactory dysfunction (hyposmia) may be an
early marker of PD; it correlated with a 10% increased risk for
the disease 2 years later compared with other asymptomatic
relatives.122 A study involving 62 pairs of twins discordant for
PD found that smell identification was reduced in twins
affected with PD than in those who were asymptomatic.123 It
has been postulated that olfactory dysfunction is related to
either neuronal loss in the corticomedial amygdala124 or to
decreased dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb.

ASSESSMENT OF PATIENTS WITH PD
Diagnostic criteria
PD is diagnosed on clinical criteria; there is no definitive test for
diagnosis. Historically, pathological confirmation of the hallmark Lewy body on autopsy has been considered the criterion
standard for diagnosis.125 In clinical practice, diagnosis is

National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) diagnostic criteria for Parkinson’s disease (PD)128

Group A features (characteristic of PD)
Resting tremor
Bradykinesia
Rigidity
Asymmetric onset
Group B features (suggestive of alternative diagnoses)
Features unusual early in the clinical course
Prominent postural instability in the first 3 years after symptom onset
Freezing phenomenon in the first 3 years
Hallucinations unrelated to medications in the first 3 years
Dementia preceding motor symptoms or in the first year
Supranuclear gaze palsy (other than restriction of upward gaze) or slowing of vertical saccades
Severe, symptomatic dysautonomia unrelated to medications
Documentation of condition known to produce parkinsonism and plausibly connected to the patient’s symptoms (such as suitably located
focal brain lesions or neuroleptic use within the past 6 months)
Criteria for definite PD
All criteria for probable Parkinson’s are met and
Histopathological confirmation of the diagnosis is obtained at autopsy
Criteria for probable PD
At least three of the four features in group A are present and
None of the features in group B is present (note: symptom duration >3 years is necessary to meet this requirement) and
Substantial and sustained response to levodopa or a dopamine agonist has been documented
Criteria for possible PD
At least two of the four features in group A are present; at least one of these is tremor or bradykinesia and
Either none of the features in group B is present or symptoms have been present (3 years and none of the features in group B is present
and
Either substantial and sustained response to levodopa or a dopamine agonist has been documented or the patient has not had an
adequate trial of levodopa or a dopamine agonist

Review
typically based on the presence of a combination of cardinal
motor features, associated and exclusionary symptoms, and
response to levodopa.126 Although the diagnosis of PD is
straightforward when patients have a classical presentation,
differentiating PD from other forms of parkinsonism can be
challenging early in the course of the disease, when signs and
symptoms overlap with other syndromes.127
Diagnostic criteria have been developed by the UK
Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank (box 1) and the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
(NINDS) (box 2).128
However, the reliability and validity of these criteria have not
been clearly established.129 A study that included 100 patients
who underwent biopsy after clinical diagnosis using the UK
Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank criteria found that 76%
of patients met the pathological criteria; when the diagnostic
criteria were retrospectively applied, accuracy improved to
82%.130 In a later study of the brains of patients examined by
neurologists, diagnostic accuracy was considerably higher (91–
92%).131
A study evaluating 800 patients from the DATATOP trial
suggested that movement disorder specialists are skilful at
diagnosing PD.132 In this study, patients were followed-up from
early pretreatment stages for a mean of 7.6 years. Based on
autopsy data, imaging studies, response to levodopa and
atypical clinical features, only 8.1% of patients did not meet
the diagnostic criteria at the final diagnosis. Although this
represents an improvement in diagnostic accuracy over earlier
studies, it must be noted that not all diagnoses were confirmed
on pathological examination.
Misdiagnosis of PD can arise for a number of reasons. In a
community based study of patients taking antiparkinsonian
medication (n = 402), the most common causes of misdiagnoses
were essential tremor, Alzheimer’s disease and vascular parkinsonism.127 133 More than 25% of patients in this study did not
respond to antiparkinsonian medication. In addition, many of
the prominent features of PD (eg, rigidity, gait disturbance,
bradykinesia) may also occur as a result of normal aging or from
comorbid and multifactorial medical conditions (eg, diabetes,
cancer).134 135

response to levodopa.36 Subcutaneous injection of apomorphine
has been used to differentiate between PD and other parkinsonian disorders; however, this test is not superior to levodopa
therapy and contributes little to diagnostic evaluation.138
Neuroimaging techniques may also be useful for differentiating PD from other parkinsonian disorders.139 Potential imaging
studies include high field strength (1.5 T) heavily T2 weighted
MRI,139 [18F]-fluorodopa positron emission tomography,139 [11C]raclopride imaging of dopamine D2 receptors140 and single
photon emission computed tomography of striatal dopamine
reuptake sites.141 One study suggested that brain parenchyma
sonography may be highly specific for differentiating between
PD and atypical parkinsonism142; however, it also showed
abnormal hyperechogenicity not only in PD but in essential
tremor.143 Although these neuroimaging techniques are promising, further refinement in resolution and improvement in
sensitivity are needed before their diagnostic potential is fully
realised.

CONCLUSIONS
PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder manifested by a
broad spectrum of motor and non-motor features. The natural
progression of PD is variable but is usually more rapid in
patients with late onset and with the PIGD form of PD. In a
comprehensive review of the literature, the standardised
mortality ratio has been reported to range between 1 and
3.4.144 Because there are no definitive diagnostic tests for it,
clinicians require thorough knowledge of the clinical manifestations of PD to aid them in differentiating it from related
disorders. Future research may uncover disease specific biomarkers allowing for its differentiation from other neurodegenerative disorders. Not only will such testing be useful for
diagnosing the disease in affected persons, it will be useful for
identifying family members or populations at risk, thus
providing an opportunity to initiate neuroprotective therapy
at an asymptomatic stage.

Differential diagnosis
Parkinsonian disorders can be classified as four types: primary
(idiopathic) parkinsonism, secondary (acquired, symptomatic)
parkinsonism, heredodegenerative parkinsonism and multiple
system degeneration (parkinsonism plus syndromes). Several
features, such as tremor, early gait abnormality (eg, freezing),
postural instability, pyramidal tract findings and response to
levodopa, can be used to differentiate PD from other parkinsonian disorders. Although differences in the density of postsynaptic dopamine receptors in patients with PD or other
atypical parkinsonian disorders have been used to explain the
poor response to levodopa therapy in the latter group, this may
not be the only explanation. Recent positron emission
tomography imaging studies have shown relative preservation
of dopamine receptors in PSP,136 suggesting downstream
changes as a possible mechanism for the lack of response.
Furthermore, patients with MSA often have excellent initial
responses but frequently develop levodopa related orofacial
dyskinesias and lose antiparkinsonian efficacy. Although
improvement with levodopa is suggestive of PD, it does not
definitively differentiate PD from other parkinsonian disorders.137 One study found that only 77% of patients with
pathologically proven PD had a ‘‘good’’ or ‘‘excellent’’ initial
