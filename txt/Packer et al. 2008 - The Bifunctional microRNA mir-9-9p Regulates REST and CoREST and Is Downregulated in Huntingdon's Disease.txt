The transcription factor REST silences neuronal gene expression in non-neuronal cells. In neurons, the protein is sequestered in the
cytoplasm in part through binding to huntingtin. Polyglutamine expansions in huntingtin, which causes Huntington’s disease (HD),
abrogates REST-huntingtin binding. Consequently, REST translocates to the nucleus, occupies RE1 repressor sequences and decreases
neuronal gene expression. In this work, we found that levels of several microRNAs (miRNAs) with upstream RE1 sites are decreased in HD
patient cortices relative to healthy controls. Interestingly, one of these, the bifunctional brain enriched miR-9/miR-9*, targets two
components of the REST complex: miR-9 targets REST and miR-9* targets CoREST. These data provide evidence for a double negative
feedback loop between the REST silencing complex and the miRNAs it regulates.

Introduction
Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion
in huntingtin, which encodes Huntingtin (Htt) (The Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993). Patients with
HD experience abnormal motor movements, cognitive decline
and psychiatric disturbances that frequently result in premature
death. Although Htt is ubiquitously expressed, patients with HD
show predominantly CNS manifestations. One of the molecular
phenotypes in HD patients is transcriptional misregulation in
striatum and distinct cortical regions (Hodges et al., 2006). One
putative mechanism underlying the transcriptional changes is
aberrant cellular distribution of the transcriptional repressor
RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST, also known as neuronrestrictive silencer factor, NRSF) (Lunyak et al., 2002; Zuccato et
al., 2003, 2007).
REST expression is highest in pluripotent stem cells and decreases upon restriction to neural progenitor cells and subsequently to neurons (Ballas et al., 2005). In mature, healthy neurons, REST is expressed at low levels and primarily sequestered in
the cytoplasm in part through interaction with Htt (Zuccato et
al., 2003). However, in patients with HD, mutant Htt fails to bind

REST, enabling its nuclear translocation (Zuccato et al., 2003).
Once in the nucleus, REST can bind RE1 consensus sequences
and recruit corepressors including mSin3, REST corepressor 1
(CoREST, also known as RCOR1), and methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) (Andrés et al., 1999) to inactivate neuron-specific
genes (Zuccato et al., 2003; Conaco et al., 2006). Similarly, REST
repressor complex binding to RE1 sequences upstream of
miRNA transcripts may alter miRNA expression profiles
(Conaco et al., 2006; Klein et al., 2007).
MiRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that participate in posttranscriptional regulation through sequence complementarity to
the 3⬘ untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. Binding of a
miRNA to its target mRNA typically results in its translational
repression through mRNA degradation or translational inhibition (Bartel, 2004). Given their essential role in modulation of
cellular processes such as cell fate, identity, and function (Sempere et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2007; Makeyev et al., 2007), we
screened a panel of predicted REST-regulated miRNAs (Jothi et
al., 2008) in samples collected from healthy control and HD patient brains (HD grades 1– 4). Our data show miRNA misregulation during HD progression, and moreover, evidence that miR9/miR-9*, a REST-regulated miRNA, targets two components of
the REST silencing complex.

Materials and Methods
Human tissues. Postmortem brain samples were obtained from the New
York Brain Bank (Columbia University, New York, NY), the Harvard
Brain Bank (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA), and the New Zealand
Neurological Foundation Brain Bank (University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand) with informed consent from families. Tissues were
collected from Brodmann’s area 4 (BA4) cortex of healthy control (n ⫽ 7;
ages 46 – 62) and HD grade 1 (n ⫽ 7; ages 42–70), 2 (n ⫽ 6; ages 45–78),
3 (n ⫽ 2; ages 60 – 65), and 4 (n ⫽ 4; 53– 60). CAG repeat length for

controls was 16 –21; HD grade 1– 4 was 37– 46. Postmortem time for
brain samples was 2–20 h.
miRNA expression profiling. RNA was collected from cortex using
TRIzoL (Invitrogen). Expression profiles for the mature miRNAs were
obtained by quantitative PCR (QPCR) using TaqMan Array Human
MiRNA Panel v1.0 (TLDA) or TaqMan MiRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems; ABI) according to the manufacture on an ABI Prism 7900HT.
Mature miRNAs were normalized to RNU48 and are shown as fold
change relative to controls.
Cloning 3⬘ UTRs and endogenous miRNAs. The 3⬘ UTR of REST (NCBI
36, Oct 2005) (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material) was verified in NT2, Neuroblastoma, A549, HEK
293 and HeLa cells by sequencing of cDNAs prepared from TRIzoL (Invitrogen) isolated RNA, then PCR amplified using Expand High Fidelity
DNA polymerase (RocheApplied Science) and 3⬘ UTR specific primers
(see supplemental methods, available at www.jneurosci.org). Both REST
and CoREST 3⬘ UTRs were cloned from HEK 293 cDNAs into
psiCHECK-2 (Promega) downstream of Renilla luciferase. Human miR9 –3 loci were amplified from HEK 293 genomic DNA and cloned into a
Zero Blunt TOPO (Invitrogen) containing a Pol III mouse U6 promoter.
mU6 miR-124a-1 and miR-132 hairpins were cloned as described above.
Perfect target controls. Perfect target (PT) controls for miR-9, 9* and
132 were made by complexing 8 ␮M sense and antisense oligonucleotides
containing a site with perfect complementarity to the mature miRNA
and random flanking sequence. PCR cycles were 2 times at 94°C 15 s,
67°C 30 s, 72°C 1 min and extension for 1 min, 72°C, then cloned downstream of Renilla luciferase.
Cell culture, transfections, and luciferase assays. HEK 293 and NT2
[NTERA-2 c1.D1, lot number 4742175 from ATCC (CFL-1973)] cells
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
calf serum at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected in triplicate on 24-well
plates with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per the instructions of the manufacturer, with 4 ng of psiCHECK-3⬘ UTR plasmid and 4 – 400 ng of mU6
miRNA or pre-miR-9, 9* or negative controls (Ambion). Anti-miRNA rescue experiments were performed by cotransfecting psiCHECK-3⬘ UTR plasmids in conjunction with mU6 miR-9/miR-9* and anti-miRs 9 –3, 9 –3* or
negative controls (Ambion). For NT2 differentiation, 0.01 mM all-trans retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the media for 5 d.
Luciferase was measured 24 h later on a moon light luminometer
(PharMingen). Renilla luciferase was normalized to firefly luciferase and
is shown relative to controls.
“Target site protectors” (TSPs) were designed antisense to predicted
3⬘UTR MRE of REST and CoREST (supplemental methods, available at
www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Optimized TSPs were designed
with M. Behlke, Integrated DNA Technologies and used at 0.01–0.1 nM.
siRNAs. HEK 293 and NT2 cells were transfected with 5 nM silencer
select siRNAs to REST (s11933) (si-REST), or a scrambled negative control (si-NEG) (Ambion) as above. Total RNA was harvested 48 h later
with TRIzol (Invitrogen), reverse transcribed with High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit, then analyzed by QPCR using REST or 18 s
rRNA TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (ABI).
Western blots. Protein was harvested using RIPA buffer (Pierce) and
1⫻ protease inhibitor using standard techniques and quantified using
DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Protein extracts were separated on a 7%
acrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon PDVF transfer membranes
(Millipore). Primary antibodies to REST/NRSF (1:500; ab21635),
CoREST (1:1000; ab56165) (both Abcam) and ␤-actin (1:10,000; Sigma)
were used. Blots were developed using ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare) and quantified by AlphaEase FC (Alpha
Innotech, version 5.0.1).
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed
by Dunnett’s post hoc analysis (GraphPad InStat, GraphPad Software,
version 3.06).

Results
miRNA expression changes with HD progression
To determine whether miRNAs are affected with HD disease progression, we isolated total RNA from control and HD grade 1– 4
brain samples. We specifically chose Brodmann’s area 4 (BA4)

Packer et al. • miR-9/miR-9* Regulates REST and CoREST

cortex because prior work indicates widespread transcriptional
changes in this region in HD patients (Hodges et al., 2006). We
found five predicted REST-regulated miRs to be significantly different with increasing HD grade: miR-9 (F(3,22) ⫽ 9.876, p ⫽
0.0003), miR-9* (F(3,22) ⫽ 6.799, p ⫽ 0.0021), miR-29b (F(3,22) ⫽
3.658, p ⫽ 0.0281), miR-124a (F(3,16) ⫽ 7.833, p ⫽ 0.001), and
miR-132 (F(3,22) ⫽ 7.611 p ⫽ 0.0011) (Fig. 1 A). For miR-139,
miR-135b, and miR-212 no significant differences were observed
with increasing disease severity, while miR-218 demonstrated a
trend toward increasing expression with disease grade (Fig. 1 A).
Previous work by Johnson and colleagues measured precursor
miRNA levels in HD brain of unknown disease grade (Johnson et
al., 2008). Interestingly, and in contrast to our findings, their
work showed no change in miR-124a, elevated levels of miR-29a,
and decreased levels of miR-132. We saw a trend toward increased miR-29a in tissue from early stage HD, followed by diminished levels. Also, we found no change in miR-132 at stages 1
and 2, but significant upregulation later. The differences in precursor (Johnson et al., 2008) versus mature miRNA levels (this
study) is not surprising given recent reports describing posttranscriptional regulation of miRNAs (Obernosterer et al., 2006; Lee
et al., 2008).
We next used a QPCR based miRNA array platform to evaluate the expression profiles of 365 mature miRNAs in BA4 cortex
from control and early stage HD (grades 1 and 2). We found an
additional 7 miRNAs that were decreased in HD1 and/or HD2
samples (supplemental Table 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material). Also, miR-196a and miR-486 were significantly increased by nearly sixfold and threefold, respectively,
in HD1 samples relative to controls. These results provide additional evidence for differential regulation of select miRNAs in
HD.
REST and CoREST contain predicted miR-9 and 9*
regulatory sites
MiR-9 and miR-9*, which decreased early in HD (Fig. 1 A), are
processed from the same primary transcript from 3 genomic loci
(miR-9 –1, 9 –2 and 9 –3); miR-9 –1 and miR-9 –3 both have upstream RE1 sequences that can be occupied by REST (Conaco et
al., 2006; Johnson et al., 2008). We amplified the human miR9 –3 locus from HEK 293 cells and cloned it downstream of the
mouse U6 promoter (mU6 miR-9/9*) for heterologous expression of miR-9/miR-9*. The cloned mU6 miR-9/9* plasmid resulted in efficient expression and processing of both miR-9 and
miR-9* as determined by knockdown of perfect target controls
(PT) (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material).
Among the targets predicted for miR-9 and 9* are REST and
CoREST [TargetScan 4.1 (Lewis et al., 2003)]. This is interesting
given the putative role of the REST repressor complex in misregulation of genes in HD (Zuccato et al., 2003). The 3⬘ UTRs of
REST (supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material) and CoREST (supplemental Fig. S3,
available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) contain
miRNA recognition elements (MRE) for miR-9, miR-9*, miR132 and miR-124a (CoREST only) (Wu and Xie, 2006). As a first
test of miR-9/9* and REST or CoREST interaction, we cloned the
3⬘ UTR of REST and CoREST downstream from the gene encoding Renilla luciferase. Cotransfection of mU6 miR-9/9* with
REST or CoREST-3⬘ UTR reporter constructs significantly decreased Renilla luciferase activity compared with controls (F(2,6)
⫽ 333.08, p ⫽ 0.0001 and F(2,6) ⫽ 16.134, p ⫽ 0.0034 for REST
and CoREST, respectively) (Fig. 1 B, C). Consistent with these

reporter-based assays, over expression of mU6 miR-9/9*, but not
mU6 miR-124a or 132, in HEK 293 cells significantly reduced
REST (F(2,12) ⫽ 26.006, p ⫽ 0.0001) and CoREST (F(2,12) ⫽
24.017, p ⫽ 0.0001) expression (Fig. 1 D, E). Therefore, the predicted MREs in CoREST and REST for miR-9/9*, but not miR124a and miR-132, are functional (Fig. 1 D, E).
miR-9 targets REST
The full-length 3⬘ UTR of REST (supplemental Fig. S2, available
at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) and CoREST
(supplemental Fig S3, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material) contain several predicted conserved MRE sites
for miR-9 and miR-9*. Because mU6 miR-9/9* produces mature
miR-9 and miR-9* upon processing (supplemental Fig. S1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), we used
artificial precursor miRNAs (pre-miR) that release a single mature miRNA (in this case miR-9 or miR-9*) and anti-miRNAs
(which are antisense to each mature miRNA) to determine
whether there is preferential activity for miR-9, miR-9*, or both
on REST and/or CoREST. Cotransfection of 15 nM pre-miR-9
with luciferase reporters containing the 3⬘ UTR of REST significantly reduced reporter gene expression (F(2,9) ⫽ 35.524, p ⬍

0.0001) in contrast to pre-miR-9* or a negative control pre-miR
(Fig. 2 A). [Specificity of the pre-miRs was confirmed using reporter constructs containing perfect miRNA target sites (supplemental Fig. S4, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental
material)]. Also, anti-miR-9, but not anti-miR-9* rescued the
inhibition of Renilla luciferase activity seen upon cotransfecting
mU6 miR-9/9* with the REST 3⬘ UTR reporter plasmid (F(2,6) ⫽
19.539, p ⫽ 0.0024) (supplemental Fig. S5, available at www.
jneurosci.org as supplemental material). To extend the reporter
studies to endogenous REST, we transfected HEK 293 cells with
pre-miR-9. This resulted in significant knockdown of endogenous REST protein expression (F(2,9) ⫽ 7.552, p ⫽ 0.0119) compared with pre-miR-9* or the pre-miR negative control (Fig.
2 B, C). Together, these results suggest that the miR-9 predicted
MREs in the 3⬘ UTR of REST are functional, in contrast to the
miR-9* predicted MREs.
We next designed a LNA-modified oligonucleotide as a TSP,
with sequence complementarity to the predicted miR-9 binding
site in the REST 3⬘ UTR (supplemental Fig. S6, available at
www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). TSPs contain sequences antisense to the MRE along with flanking sequences and
serve to block specific miRNA-target site interactions within a 3⬘

UTR. These are distinct from anti-miRs,
which impair all miRNA-target interactions. Cotransfection of HEK 293 cells
with the REST 3⬘ UTR reporter plasmid,
the mU6 miR-9/9* plasmid and TSP⫹
(targeting the terminal MRE in REST)
(supplemental Fig. S2, available at www.

showed protection from mRNA-mediated
silencing compared with mU6 miR-9/9*treated cells (F(2,9) ⫽ 38.395, p ⬍ 0.0001)
(supplemental Fig. S6, available at www.
jneurosci.org as supplemental material).
Consistent with these observations, REST
levels in HEK 293 cells, which decreased
upon mU6 miR-9/9* transfection (Fig.
1 D, E) was rescued by TSP⫹ (Student’s t
test, p ⬍ 0.05), but not a control TSP (TSP
Neg) (Fig. 2 D).
miR-9* targets CoREST
We used similar approaches to ascertain
whether miR-9, miR-9* or both were
functional in regulating CoREST. Cotransfection of the CoREST 3⬘ UTR reporter plasmid and 5 or 15 nM pre-miR-9*
reduced reporter expression compared
with controls (F(2,11) ⫽ 41.612, p ⫽ 0.0001
and F(2,11) ⫽ 7.423, p ⫽ 0.0091, respectively), unlike miR-9 (Fig. 3A). Also, only
pre-miR-9* significantly reduced endogenous CoREST expression in HEK 293 cells
(F(2,9) ⫽ 11.173, p ⫽ 0.0036) (Fig. 3 B, C).
Also, reduced CoREST expression after
transfection of HEK 293 cells with mU6
miR-9/9* (Fig. 1 D, E) was relieved upon
anti-miR-9* cotransfection (supplemental
Fig. S7, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material).
We next used TSPs against the conserved
predicted miR-9* binding site in CoREST to
test its functionality (supplemental Fig. S8,
available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material). Cotransfection of mU6
miR-9/9* in the presence of TSP⫹ significantly rescued reporter gene expression
compared with mU6 miR-9/9*-treated cells
(F(2,6) ⫽ 32.882, p ⫽ 0.0006) (supplemental
Fig. S8, available at www.jneurosci.org as
supplemental material). Endogenous CoREST protein expression, which was reduced
after pre-miR-9* transfection, increased
upon cotransfection of TSP⫹ (Student’s t
test, p ⬍ 0.05) but not TSP Neg (Fig. 3D).
These data provide support for a miR-9*
MRE in regulating CoREST.
Finally, we tested how reducing REST
expression impacts endogenous miR-9
levels in HEK 293 and NT2 cells. In both
cell lines, short-term reduction in REST
expression resulted in enhanced miR-9 expression ( p ⬍ 0.05) and processing as determined by measuring level of mature

miR (supplemental Fig. S9, available at www.jneurosci.org as

miR-9 –3 (Conaco et al., 2006) and provide functional evidence
for a negative feed back look between components of the REST
complex and REST-regulated miRNAs.

Discussion
The transcriptional repressor REST is mislocalized in brains of
patients with HD, with increased nuclear localization and occupancy at RE1 sites compared with healthy controls (Zuccato et al.,
2003, 2007). REST interacts with CoREST and other transcriptional repressors to regulate neuronal gene expression and lineage commitment through its direct control of both mRNA and,
as shown more recently, miRNA transcripts (Vo et al., 2005;
Conaco et al., 2006; Mortazavi et al., 2006; Visvanathan et al.,
2007). Indeed, canonical and noncanonical REST binding motifs
have recently been mapped in close proximity to 22 miRNA sites
in the human genome, including several of which are located
within close proximity to neuron enriched miRNAs (Bruce et al.,
2004; Jothi et al., 2008).
In this study we found several miRNAs to be significantly
misregulated among RNA harvested from HD brains compared
with those of healthy controls. Of these, the bifunctional miR-9/
miR-9* targets two components of the REST repressor complex:
miR-9 targets REST and miR-9* targets CoREST. MiR-132 has
been shown to target MeCP2 (Klein et al., 2007), which can interact with REST and CoREST to suppress transcription (Lunyak
et al., 2002). Double negative feedback networks have been reported in other systems where critical balancing of multiple factors is essential (Tsang et al., 2007).
Recent studies on the brain enriched miR-9 have revealed its
importance in development and lineage commitment (Sempere
et al., 2004; Krichevsky et al., 2006). In zebrafish, miR-9 is important for midbrain-hindbrain boundary definition (Leucht et al.,
2008). In mouse cortical development, miR-9 appears necessary
for appropriate differentiation of Cajal-Retzius cells (Shibata et
al., 2008). In addition to miR-9/miR-9*, mature miR-124a is
significantly reduced in HD cortices. miR-124 promotes neuronal differentiation, in part through targeting of a splicing factor
(Makeyev et al., 2007). Also, over-expression of miR-124 in nonneuronal cells induces gene expression profiles to a neuronal phenotype (Lim et al., 2005). Interestingly, genes related to neurogenesis are highly overrepresented among the genes changed in
expression in the cortex (BA4) of HD patients (Hodges et al.,
2006). This may reflect a dedifferentiation mediated by aberrant
REST localization, because REST mRNA levels do not change
significantly in HD (Hodges et al., 2006), as well as global changes
in miR-9/9* and miR-124a target levels. Whether diminished
levels of miR-9/9*, miR-124a and other miRNAs in HD cortex
result from, or contribute to, the dedifferentiation profile is currently under study.
In summary, we show that several REST-regulated miRNAs
decrease with disease progression in HD brain. We demonstrate
that among these, miR-9 and miR-9* target REST and CoREST,
respectively. Our findings, together with recent work showing
that REST can be regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis
(Westbrook et al., 2008) underscore the importance of maintaining appropriate levels and intracellular localization (Zuccato et
al., 2003) of this repressor complex for appropriate gene transcription and lineage commitment.
