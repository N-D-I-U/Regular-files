At present, dopamine agonists play an important role in antiparkinsonian therapy since they
were proved effective in the management of both advanced- and early-stage Parkinson’s
disease. In the latter, they are often regarded as first-choice medication to delay the
introduction of levodopa therapy. Despite sharing the capacity to directly stimulate dopamine
receptors, dopamine agonists show different pharmacological properties as they act on
different subsets of dopamine receptors. This, in theory, provides the advantage of obtaining a
different antiparkinsonian activity or safety profile with each agent. However, there is very little
evidence that any of the marketed dopamine agonists should be consistently preferred in the
management of patients with Parkinson’s disease. Pergolide and cabergoline are now
considered a second-line choice after the proven association with valvular fibrosis.
Transdermal administration (rotigotine) and subcutaneous infusion (apomorphine) of
dopamine receptor agonists are now available alternatives to oral administration and provide
continuous dopaminergic stimulation. Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion during
waking hours leads to a large reduction in daily ‘off’ time, dyskinesias and levodopa daily
dose. Almost all currently used dopamine agonists are able to provide neuroprotective effects
towards dopaminergic neurons during in vitro and in vivo experiments. This neuroprotection
may be the result of different mechanisms including antioxidation, scavenging of free radicals,
suppression of lipid peroxidation and inhibition of apoptosis. However, the disease-modifying
effect of these agents in Parkinson’s disease remains to be ascertained.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that clinically
manifests as a combination of rest tremor,
bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability.
The neurodegenerative process in PD consists
of progressive loss of the dopaminergic neurons
in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Serotonergic, noradrenergic and cholinergic neurons
are also involved, although to a lesser extent.
Loss of cells from the substantia nigra in
patients with PD results in profound dopamine
(DA) depletion in the striatum, particularly in
the dorsolateral region of the putamen, with a
consequent disruption of the complex basal
ganglia circuitry including thalamocortical and
brainstem motor systems. The result of such a
disruption is an abnormal increment in the
inhibitory output activity of basal ganglia
toward cortical areas that produces slowness
and paucity of movements [1].

Current symptomatic treatments for PD
largely aim to improve symptoms of the disease
by correcting the neurotransmitter imbalance
within the basal ganglia circuitry. DA-replacement therapy has been and remains the mainstay approach for controlling PD symptoms
and the DA precursor, levodopa (LD), continues to be the most potent replacement agent.
LD is rapidly transformed to DA in nigrostriatal neurons by aromatic decarboxylation and
this increases the availability of DA in the striatum [2]. Nonetheless, other dopaminergic
drugs, such as DA agonists, have proved to be
effective in the management of both advancedand early-stage PD.

DA receptors. This capacity is most likely related to the
DA-like moiety within their molecular structure [3]. Currently
available DA agonists can be classified into:
• Ergot derivates (bromocriptine, pergolide, lisuride, α-dihydroergocriptyne and cabergoline), which are generally
referred to as first-generation agonists
• Nonergolines (apomorphine, piribedil, ropinirole, pramipexole and rotigotine).
The latter, except for apomorphine, have a more recent history
in the treatment of PD and were developed in the hope that they
might provide similar therapeutic effect as the ergoline agents
with fewer side effects.
There are undoubtedly pharmacological differences between
the various DA agonists as they act on different subsets of DA
receptors (TABLE 1). Bromocriptine, lisuride and pergolide bind
with high affinity to D2 family receptors but also show affinity
of varying degree for the D1 receptors, adrenergic and
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. Ropinirole and pramipexole are more specific agonists as they bind to D2 and D3
receptors only with high affinity. However, pramipexole, in
contrast to ropinirole, is more potent at D3 than at D2 receptors [4]. Rotigotine, the most recently marketed DA agonist,
preferentially binds to all DA receptors with a clear preference
for the D3 receptors. The affinities to the other DA receptors
are approximately eight- to 20-fold less for the D2 and D4
receptors, and approximately 120-fold less for the D1 receptor.
The D1 receptor also interacts with α2B, α2C, 5-HT1A, 5-HT7
and σ-receptors [5].
These different pharmacological properties provide, in theory, the advantage of obtaining a different antiparkinsonian
activity or safety profile with each agent. There is, however,
very little evidence that any of the marketed DA agonists
should be consistently preferred in the management of PD
patients. The topic has been covered in detail elsewhere [6].

Briefly, ropinirole, pramipexole and cabergoline showed similar
efficacy to bromocriptine in several randomized, double-blind
studies. Pergolide showed equivalent or superior efficacy to bromocriptine in improving clinical measures, particularly in activities of daily living and motor examination scores. More recently,
several direct comparisons between ergot and nonergot DA agonists have shown that the efficacies of the investigated agents are
largely similar [7–9].
Symptomatic effects of DA agonists in Parkinson’s disease

In clinical practice, DA agonists have been shown to be efficacious in both early and advanced PD. In advanced PD, these
drugs improve both motor disability and motor fluctuations
when added to LD reducing ‘off ’ time duration by approximately 20% [10–17]. Several open-label studies have shown that
very high doses of DA agonists might decrease LD-related
motor complications, particularly dyskinesia, owing to the large
reduction of LD daily dose [18–20].
In patients with early PD, controlled studies have demonstrated that cabergoline [21], pergolide [22], bromocriptine [23],
pramipexole [24] and ropinirole [25] are superior to placebo or
have comparable effects to LD, with less frequent and severe
dyskinesia [26–30]. However, the number of patients remaining
on agonist monotherapy decreases to less than 50% after
2–3 years of treatment, and owing to the loss of efficacy of DA
agonists over time with progressing disease, after a few years of
treatment the majority of patients will be co-administered LD.
These agents have a longer half-life than both standard- and
controlled-release preparations of LD, thereby inducing a sustained rather than pulsatile stimulation of striatal DA receptors, and this may help explain the lower incidence of motor
complications, particularly dyskinesias, in patients taking DA
agonists compared with those on LD [23,26–29,31]. However, a
recent study has shown that an end of dose deterioration –
‘wearing-off ’ phenomenon – was also present in 30% of PD
patients treated with ropinirole (n = 27) or pramipexole
(n = 25) monotherapy for less than 2 years [32].
Treatment strategies
Switching one agonist to another

Switching between DA agonists is a current practice in case of
waning efficacy, or intolerable side effects such as excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), sleep attacks (SA), dizziness or hypotension. Additionally, the recent mounting evidence of fibrotic
reactions (see side effect section) to ergot DA agonists is
increasing the practice of substituting ergot with nonergot DA
agonists. Many guidelines for PD treatment propose equivalent charts or conversion factors between dosages of DA agonists with 1:6 for pergolide to ropinirole, 10:6 for bromocriptine to ropinirole, 10:1 for bromocriptine to pergolide and
10:1–1.5 for bromocriptine to pramipexole [33]. TABLE 2 summarizes approximate dose equivalents for DA agonists. Several
studies demonstrate that switching from one agonist to
another can be carried out rapidly, usually overnight, without
any major complications [7,9,34].

Preliminary data for switching from an oral DA agonist to
transdermal rotigotine are also available. The results from a
Phase IIIb, open-label trial were presented at the First World Parkinson Disease Congress in Washington in 2006. This study has
shown that an overnight switch from ropinirole, pramipexole
and cabergoline to rotigotine can be achieved safely and is well
tolerated. The maximum doses at entry were ropinirole 9 mg,
pramipexole 2 mg salt and cabergoline 3 mg, which corresponded to rotigotine 8 mg/day (40 cm2, 18 mg total drug content). A total of 80% of the patients required no dose adjustments after switching to rotigotine, 9.5% had one adjustment
and 10.3% withdrew early (4.4% owing to side effects) [35].
Dual DA agonist treatment

Combining two different DA agonists has been suggested as an
alternative strategy for prolonging DA agonist monotherapy in
early PD and avoiding LD increases in more advanced patients.
Since DA agonists have different receptor-binding properties and
different pharmacokinetic characteristics, it has been postulated
that two DA agonists induce a more complete activation of DA
receptors than a single agonist and consequently a better clinical
effect. Unfortunately, no controlled studies addressing this issue
are available. In a recent open study, 37 PD patients with and
12 without motor fluctuations received cabergoline as an adjunct
to their therapy with pramipexole or ropinirole at the maximal
permitted dose. In the fluctuating group, cabergoline decreased
the time spent in ‘off ’ by 65.6%, and reduced the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores by 19.24%
during the ‘off ’ condition and by 7.1% during the ‘on’ condition.
Nocturnal akinesia also improved. In the 12 patients without
motor fluctuation, UPDRS scores improved by 34.4% when
cabergoline was added to the current treatment [36].

increasing doses of rotigotine (from 2 mg to a maximum of
6 mg/24 h), and then maintained for 6 months. In both studies,
the UPDRS (part II and III) score significantly improved with
the higher doses (6 and 8 mg/24 h) relative to placebo. Interestingly, in the second study, the proportion of responders at the
end of treatment (patients showing a decrease in UPDRS part II
and III score from baseline by 20% or greater) was significantly
higher in the rotigotine group than in the placebo group (48 vs
19%; p < 0.0001). A 3-year, open-label extension of this trial is
currently ongoing to monitor the longevity of rotigotine treatment effects as well as clinical safety. Similar results for responders to the treatment were obtained in the third 6-month controlled study [39] where maintenance dose of rotigotine was
6 mg/day. In these studies, application site reactions were common in rotigotine-treated patients (approximately 50% of
patients receiving the higher doses), but required discontinuation
of treatment only in 5% of patients [37–39].
A recently published study [40] demonstrated that rotigotine 8
or 12 mg/day compared with placebo was able to reduce the
duration of ‘off ’ periods by 2.7 and 2.1 h, respectively, in a large
group of PD patients not optimally controlled with LD and with
off periods lasting more than 2.5 h.
Another study investigated the efficacy and safety of rotigotine
as an adjunctive treatment to LD in patients with advanced inadequately controlled PD compared with placebo or pramipexole
[41]. Patients received either placebo (n = 101), rotigotine up to
maximum dose of 16 mg/day (n = 204) or pramipexole up to
maximum dose of 4.5 mg/day (n = 201) for 16 weeks. Rotigotine showed clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction in ‘off ’ time compared with placebo and a similar effect
compared with pramipexole.
Subcutaneous administration of DA agonists

Transdermal administration of DA agonists

Rotigotine, a lipid-soluble nonergoline D3/D2/D1 receptor agonist, is the first DA agonist developed as a transdermal formulation and is currently licensed as monotherapy for early-stage
PD. The silicone-based transdermal patch, which is applied to
the skin once daily, delivers rotigotine at a constant rate over
24 h producing a continuous dopaminergic stimulation of striatal DA receptors. Three Phase III, multicenter studies of rotigotine in untreated patients with early PD have been performed
[37–39]. In the first study, conducted by the Parkinson Study
Group, four different doses of rotigotine patch (4.5, 9.0, 13.5 or
18.0 mg corresponding to 2, 4, 6 and 8 mg/24 h, respectively)
or placebo were administered to 242 early PD patients for
11 weeks in a parallel-group paradigm. In the second randomized controlled trial [38], 277 patients were given placebo or

Apomorphine is a DA agonist with a receptor affinity similar to
DA, and is prescribed for subcutaneous use as bolus injections
or continuous infusion. Intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine therapy is generally used as rescue therapy for severe
intractable ‘off ’ periods in patients with fluctuating PD owing to
its rapid onset, usually within 10 min, and robust response with
a rapid improvement of ‘off ’ periods lasting 90–120 min [42].
Disease progression, however, may necessitate an increase in
the number of injections to 10 or more per day. In these cases,
apomorphine can be administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion using an automated syringe driver. Several studies,
including a recent prospective one, indicate that apomorphine
continuous subcutaneous infusion during waking hours leads
to a large reduction in daily ‘off ’ time, dyskinesias and LD
daily dose [42–44]. The antidyskinetic effect of apomorphine is

1393

Bonuccelli & Pavese

comparable to that observed with deep brain stimulation of the
subthalamic nucleus, but despite increasing evidence of its
efficacy and safety, apomorphine infusion is still underused.
Lisuride is also administered subcutaneously. Its bioavailability, which is between 10 and 20% when given orally owing to a
large first-pass metabolism, becomes near to 100% when
administered subcutaneously or transdermally. In a recent
study, subcutaneous administration of lisuride over a long
period of time (4 years) was compared with conventional oral
LD treatment in 40 patients [45]. Over 4 years, mean ‘off ’ time
in the lisuride treatment group decreased by 2.9 h, whereas it
increased by 0.9 h in the LD group (p < 0.001). This effect,
evidenced since the beginning of the treatment, was maintained
over time, indicating that tolerance is not likely to develop.
Moreover, there was a 40.9% reduction in dyskinesias in the
lisuride group compared with a 59.1% increase in the LD
group (p < 0.001), as indicated by mean Abnormal Involuntary
Movement Scale (AIMS) scores.
Controlled-release formulation of DA agonists

The ongoing development of slow-release formulations for DA
agonists opens new ways of continuous DA receptor stimulation.
The results of a large, randomized controlled study of the efficacy and safety of ropinirole 24 h prolonged-release formulation
(Efficacy and Safety Evaluation in PD Adjunct) have recently
been published [46]. A total of 393 PD patients poorly controlled
by LD alone were randomly assigned to ropinirole 24 h
(202 patients) or placebo (191 patients) as an adjunct to LD for
24 weeks. Ropinirole was titrated to a starting dose of 2 mg/day
and increased in steps of 2 mg/day as necessary, until an optimal
therapeutic dose was reached. At week 24, the mean ropinirole
dose was 18.6 mg/day with a mean reduction in daily LD of 278
mg. The mean reduction in daily ‘off ’ time (primary study outcome) was 2.1 h in the ropinirole 24 h group, and 0.3 h in the
placebo group. The mean difference was 1.7 h (p < 0.0001). The
authors also found a significant increase in patients’ percentage
of ‘on’ time as well as ‘on’ time without troublesome dyskinesias.
Other secondary study outcomes, including quality of life, sleep,
depression, emotional wellbeing, stigma and communication,
were also significantly improved with ropinirole 24 h compared
with placebo. Dyskinesias occurred in 13% of patients receiving
ropinirole 24 h compared with 3% of those on placebo. Other
side effects occurring in a higher percentage of patients receiving
ropinirole 24 h were nausea, dizziness, somnolence, hallucination and orthostatic hypotension. Ropinirole 24 h prolonged
release has not yet been approved by the US FDA.
Neuroprotective effects of DA agonists

In addition to their symptomatic effects, DA agonists may exert
a neuroprotective action in PD. The topic has been covered in
detail in a previous issue of this journal [47] and only a brief
summary is reported in this review.
The LD sparing effect was the initial basis for considering DA
agonists as neuroprotective agents in PD. These drugs, in contrast to LD, do not undergo oxidative metabolism and do not

1394

generate toxic free radicals or induce oxidative stress. Moreover,
DA agonists may also decrease free radical production and the
risk of oxidative damage by inhibiting DA synthesis, release and
metabolism via activation of presynaptic receptors [48]. Many
agonists share a hydroxylated benzyl ring structure and so may
function as free radical scavengers. Antioxidant activity has
been demonstrated for several DA agonists in different in vitro
systems and in vivo models, including the 1-methyl-4-phenyl1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned macaque model
and 6-hydroxydopamine toxicity models (TABLE 3). In several
experimental studies, DA agonists have demonstrated antiapoptotic activity by interfering with several steps of apoptotic
cascades through mechanisms independent of their antioxidant
actions [49–51]. The issue of whether or not this anti-apoptotic
effect is dependent on the activation of DA receptors remains
uncertain. Another proposed mechanism to explain neuroprotection induced by DA agonist is the inhibition of excitotoxicity mediated by overactivity of the subthalamic nucleus.
Excess glutamate release might, in fact, induce excitotoxic damages in targets of the subthalamic nucleus [52]. Finally, DA
agonists may promote neuronal survival by stimulating the
synthesis of neurotrophic factors, which have been shown to
have neuroprotective/neurorestorative properties in dopaminergic nigral neurons [53], and by inducing proliferation of neural
precursor cells in the adult brain.
Several recent clinical trials have been performed to directly
compare the effects of DA agonists (ropinirole, pramipexole,
pergolide and cabergoline) and LD on the natural course of
PD in de novo patients [26–29]. The result of the drugs on disease progression was evaluated using clinical and/or imaging
outcome measures. The clinical end point was generally based
on the incidence of dyskinesias or the time to development of
any motor complication, whereas the imaging outcome was the
rate of change in imaging markers of dopaminergic function
between baseline and end-of-study evaluation.
As previously mentioned, the consistent results of these studies are that DA agonists produce less dyskinesias compared with
LD over 2–5 years of therapy. However, there is currently no
indication that this effect is related to neuroprotective activity
of these agents. Functional imaging studies in these trials have
provided a valuable adjunct to clinical data, but they eventually
failed to demonstrate a clear-cut neuroprotective effect.
The neuroprotective effect of rotigotine has not yet been
investigated in PD patients. However, a recent paper has
evaluated the protective property of this agent in a progressive
MPTP-lesioned macaque model. After 38 days of treatment
followed by 2 weeks of washout, rotigotine-treated animals
were significantly less parkinsonian than the nontreated ones.
A significant preservation of dopaminergic terminals, as
detected by ex vivo 125I-nortropane DA transporter (DAT)
labeling, was also seen in the rotigotine group compared with
the nontreated group. However, the magnitude of preservation
was modest and could not be detected in vivo using the single
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) DAT tracer
99m
Tc-TRODAT-1 [54].

Side effects & limitations of DA agonists: an update

Nausea, vomiting, postural hypotension and dizziness, which
are primarily due to stimulation of DA receptors at a peripheral
level outside the BBB, are the most common side effects of DA
agonists. These symptoms tend to occur with the initiation of
treatment and often subside as tolerance develops over time. In
order to minimize side effects, DA agonists are commonly initiated at subtherapeutic doses and titrated gradually to achieve
the required clinical response. Starter packs to assist with dose
titration are now available for several marketed DA agonists
(e.g., pergolide, ropinirole and rotigotine). Some clinicians,
however, prefer a more rapid titration to therapeutic doses. In
these cases, cotreatment with the peripheral D2 receptor antagonist domperidone 20 mg three-times weekly is commonly
employed to reduce unwanted side effects and increase tolerability. Domperidone, however, does not seem to be effective in
reducing postural hypotension.
Peripheral edema is another common peripheral side effect
associated with DA agonist treatment. Edema is usually limited
to ankles but in more severe cases involves calves and knees. It
has been reported with all of the DA agonists and seems to be
dose related but its mechanism is unknown.
Ergot-derived DA agonists have been associated with pleuropulmonary fibrosis and retroperitoneal fibrosis; the higher incidence of fibrotic reactions during either bromocriptine or pergolide chronic therapy is biased by their more extended
availability from the point of view of number of patients
exposed and time after the commercial launch [55]. However,
for bromocriptine a prevalence of fibrotic reactions of 2–5%
over a 5-year period has been reported [56], suggesting that
before starting treatment with these agonists, it is appropriate
to obtain a chest x-ray and blood tests including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and serum creatinine. During treatment, patients should be monitored for dyspnoea, persistent cough, chest pain, cardiac failure and
abdominal pain, and annual screening with chest x-rays and
blood tests is warranted.
Over the recent years, ergot-derived DA agonists, particularly pergolide and cabergoline, have also been associated with
an increased risk of valvular heart disease [57–61]. Both restrictive and regurgitative valvular heart disease has been reported
in PD patients on pergolide, but also on bromocriptine and
www.future-drugs.com

cabergoline. Histological findings appear to resemble those of
valvulopathies associated to the carcinoid syndrome and the use
of antimigraine ergot alkaloid agents or fenfluramine [62–64].
The mechanism of fibrotic reaction by ergot-derived DA agonists has not yet been completely clarified yet. Suggested mechanisms include immune-mediated reaction and/or modulation
at peripheral serotonin subtype receptors, mainly the receptor
subtype 5-HT2B, which is expressed in heart valves and is
known to mediate mitogenesis [65,66]. Interestingly, the ergolinic lisuride, which acts as a pure antagonist to the 5-HT2B
receptor [67], has never been reported to cause cardiac valvular
fibrosis. Similarly, ropinirole and pramipexole, which have low
affinity to the human 5-HT2B receptor, seem to have a lower
risk of inducing cardiac valve disease [59,60].
In summary, the number of cases reported so far seems to be
low with respect to the total population of drug consumers
worldwide. Additionally, there is little information regarding
the total dose at risk, the duration of exposure and comorbidities that could be facilitating factors for valvular degeneration
(i.e., aging, diabetes, arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and smoking). Crucial information will come from longitudinal studies in which individual patients are followed
before and after starting ergot-derived DA agonists and from
further investigations on the relationship between drug exposure and individual predisposing factors. In the mean time, it
should always be recalled when prescribing a DA agonist that
any increase in the risk of a certain complication must be counterbalanced with an increased benefit. Pergolide and cabergoline should be reserved for second-line treatment. Additionally,
an ECG should be performed at least twice a year when these
agonists are used.
Central adverse effects similar to those seen with LD can also
occur and are mainly psychiatric, including vivid dreams, delusions, mood changes, paranoid psychoses and hallucinations.
The previously mentioned comparative studies between DA
agonists and LD, however, showed that neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly hallucinations, are more common with DA
agonists (7–17%) than LD (0–5%) and are more frequent in
elderly or cognitively impaired patients.
Several lines of evidence suggest that DA agonist play a role
in the origin of EDS and sudden onset of sleep or SA, controversially defined as an ‘event of overwhelming sleepiness that
1395

Bonuccelli & Pavese

occurs without warning’ [68]. The most compelling evidence of
DA agonists as a cause of EDS is the well-established observation of acute drowsiness related to single doses of the drugs.
This is not surprising as all of the DA agonists have a sedating,
probably dose-related, effect [69], although agonists that activate
the D2/D3 receptors (such as ropinirole and pramipexole) may
be more likely to induce irresistible somnolence than those that
stimulate the D1/D2 receptors [68].
A large-scale questionnaire survey reported a 42.9% prevalence of SA in PD patients and a higher risk of SA with nonergoline DA agonists in younger patients (<70 years) [70].
Another recent survey has shown the occurrence of episodes
of uncontrollable somnolence in 22% of 929 PD patients,
but a similar risk was seen for the three agents pramipexole,
ropinirole and pergolide [71]. The precise relationship of the
DA agonists to EDS and SA, however, remains to be determined as both age and disease-related disturbances of the
sleep–wake regulation appear to contribute to hypersomnia in
PD [72]. As a general rule, concomitant sedative medication
should be avoided; a reduction of the dose of a DA agonist or
the substitution with another DA agonist could alleviate EDS
and/or SA. The effect of modafinil in patients with EDS is
controversial [73–74].
Finally, several reports have indicated an association
between pathological gambling and DA agonist therapy in PD
patients [75–80]. It has been suggested that this may relate to
disproportionate stimulation of D3 receptors, which are primarily localized to the mesolimbic reward system [75]. A recent
prospective study has assessed prevalence of pathological gambling and medication association in 297 PD patients [79]. The
authors found a 7.2% prevalence of pathological gambling on
any DA agonist. Interestingly, pathological gambling was associated with earlier PD onset but not with agonist subtype or
doses. In a recent study, patients with PD who were a younger
age at PD onset, higher novelty seeking traits and a personal
or family history of alcohol use disorders showed a greater risk
for pathological gambling with DA agonists [80].
A comparison of the most frequent dopaminergic adverse
events in the previously mentioned comparative studies shows
that pramipexole and ropinirole are associated with higher frequencies of somnolence and hallucinations compared with
cabergoline and pergolide, but pergolide is associated with a
slightly higher frequency of nausea than the other DA agonists. These findings are consistent with those found in other
studies and in clinical practice.
Expert commentary

DA agonists have been commonly used as an adjunctive therapy to LD in patients developing motor complications. In
early PD and particularly in patients younger than 65 years of
age, DA agonists are possibly the first-line treatment as they
provide enough benefit without dyskinesias. When DA agonist effects wane and LD is added, those patients on combined
dopaminergic therapy still show lesser motor complications
compared with patients starting with LD monotherapy.

1396

There is insufficient evidence to conclude that any of the
current available DA agonists should be consistently preferred
in the management of PD patients. Prescribing decisions are
usually made on the basis of personal experience with a particular agent, cost or a wish (by the clinician and/or the patient)
to try a new drug. The patient’s concomitant diseases (i.e.,
kidney or liver diseases) may lead one to choose an agonist
that is metabolized by the liver (ropinirole) or excreted via the
kidney (pramipexole) [81].
In case of waning efficacy of a DA agonist, switching from
one agonist to another may be useful to prolong DA agonist
monotherapy in early PD and to avoid LD increases in more
advanced patients. The introduction of rotigotine patches and
the development of controlled-release ropinirole have opened
new ways of continuous DA receptors. Hopefully, this will
have a positive impact on the time to development of dyskinesias and other motor complications. Apomorphine and
lisuride subcutaneous infusion are underused resources for
patients with more severe LD motor complications.
Although the fibrotic complications due to ergoline DA
agonists are not very frequent, it is important to weigh risks
against benefits when deciding which DA agonist to use in a
certain patient, in other words ergoline versus nonergoline.
Cabergoline and pergolide must be considered second-line
therapies.
Five-year view

There are several issues that will direct research on DA agonists
in the near future:
• Long-term prospective studies to evaluate the real incidence
of motor complications, for example end-of-dose deterioration and dyskinesias, and nonmotor complications, such as
sleep attacks and impulse control disorders, in patients taking
DA agonists
• Development of new DA agonists more powerful than those
already available and/or capable of ensuring a good clinical
effect for more than 5 years when used in monotherapy
• Full evaluation of the effects of DA agonist therapy on imaging markers that are currently used for measuring PD
progression by means of PET and SPECT

Role of dopamine agonists in Parkinson’s disease: an update

Key issues
• Dopamine (DA) agonists have proved to be effective in the management of both advanced- and early-stage Parkinson’s disease (PD).
• In early PD, monotherapy with DA agonists has been shown to be almost as effective as levodopa, with lower propensity to induce
motor complications compared with levodopa.
• Several direct comparisons between ergot and nonergot DA agonists have shown that the efficacies of the investigated agents are
largely similar. Safety issues suggest nonergot DA agonists as first-line choice.
• DA agonists share similar side-effect profiles except for fibrotic reactions that are uncommon and are induced by ergolines;
sleepiness and sleep attacks are associated with both levodopa and DA agonists, especially the nonergolines.
• An agonist can be switched to another as fast as overnight by using appropriate equivalent doses; the substitution may be made for
the waning effectiveness of a certain agent or for the appearance of side effects.
• Rotigotine patches theoretically produce a continuous noninvasive dopaminergic stimulation of striatal DA receptors.
• Apomorphine and lisuride subcutaneous are safe and underused resources for patients with severe motor fluctuations.
