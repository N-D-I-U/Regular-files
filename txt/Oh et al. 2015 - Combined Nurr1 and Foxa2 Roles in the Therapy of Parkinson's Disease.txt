Abstract
Use of the physiological mechanisms promoting midbrain DA
(mDA) neuron survival seems an appropriate option for developing
treatments for Parkinson’s disease (PD). mDA neurons are specifically marked by expression of the transcription factors Nurr1 and
Foxa2. We show herein that Nurr1 and Foxa2 interact to protect
mDA neurons against various toxic insults, but their expression is
lost during aging and degenerative processes. In addition to their
proposed cell-autonomous actions in mDA neurons, forced expression of these factors in neighboring glia synergistically protects
degenerating mDA neurons in a paracrine mode. As a consequence
of these bimodal actions, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated
gene delivery of Nurr1 and Foxa2 in a PD mouse model markedly
protected mDA neurons and motor behaviors associated with
nigrostriatal DA neurotransmission. The effects of the combined
gene delivery were dramatic, highly reproducible, and sustained
for at least 1 year, suggesting that expression of these factors is a
promising approach in PD therapy.

Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common movement disorder prevalent
in older persons. The pathophysiologic feature of PD is progressive
degeneration of dopamine (DA)-secreting neurons (DA neurons) in
the substantia nigra (SN) of the midbrain, which results in loss of
nigrostriatal DA neurotransmission. Midbrain DA (mDA) neurons in
the SN are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress because of
their reduced levels of the antioxidant glutathione and increased

nigral iron content (Dexter et al, 1989; Sian et al, 1994). An estimated 5–10% of all PD cases are associated with genetic mutations
of the cellular components that scavenge reactive oxygen species
(ROS) (Dias et al, 2013). In addition, chronic inflammation underlies PD pathology, and a number of PD risk factors such as environmental toxins, heavy metals, head trauma, and bacterial or viral
infections are underpinned by inflammation (Wirdefeldt et al,
2011). Inflammatory reactions induce the production of ROS, and
the reverse also occurs. Thus a feed-forward cycle of ROS production and inflammation underlies DA neuronal cell death in idiopathic PD.
Current PD therapies predominantly aim at restoring DA levels
or correcting functional perturbation of the basal ganglia caused
by DA loss. These symptomatic therapies, however, do not slow
down disease progression and their efficacy declines over time.
The search continues for a treatment strategy that targets intrinsic
pathways promoting the viability and resistance of mDA neurons
against toxic insults. In addition, the idea of modifying the disease
environment surrounding mDA neurons is appearing on the
therapeutic horizon. Glial cells can produce both detrimental and
beneficial environments in the central nervous system (CNS), and
these are associated with the release of pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory (or neurotrophic) cytokines, respectively (reviewed
in reference Neumann et al, 2009). Thus a strategy biasing toward
beneficial glial cells could be a promising therapeutic approach in
PD.
Nuclear receptor-related factor 1 (Nurr1, also known as NR4A2)
is an orphan nuclear receptor initially characterized as a transcription factor important for mDA neuron development, comprising the
generation (Zetterstrom et al, 1997), maturation (Castro et al,
2001), and axonal pathfinding of mDA neurons (Wallen et al,
1999). Nurr1 continues to be expressed in adult mDA neurons, and
adult-onset deletion of this protein leads to progressive loss of mDA
neurons (Kadkhodaei et al, 2009). In heterozygous Nurr1 mice,
mDA neurons are more vulnerable to dopaminergic neurotoxins (Le
et al, 1999). The Nurr1 level in mDA neurons decreases in the
elderly (Chu et al, 2002) and PD patients (Bauer et al, 2008), and

polymorphisms and mutations resulting in reduced expression of
Nurr1 are associated with familial and sporadic PD (Le et al, 2003;
Zheng et al, 2003; Hering et al, 2004). These findings support the
notion that Nurr1 exerts a protective effect on adult mDA neurons
in a cell-autonomous manner. Indeed, several intrinsic mechanisms
implicated in Nurr1-mediated cell survival have been identified
(Volakakis et al, 2010; Malewicz et al, 2011; Decressac et al, 2012;
Kadkhodaei et al, 2013). In addition to the intrinsic role of Nurr1 in
mDA neurons, a recent study (Saijo et al, 2009) has identified an
unexpected Nurr1 effect in which it is expressed in glial cells in
response to stimuli triggering inflammation, and this Nurr1
suppresses the production of inflammatory mediators that cause the
death of mDA neurons. These findings collectively indicate that
Nurr1 could be a promising therapeutic target (Decressac et al,
2013b), by which degenerating mDA neurons could be protected in
a bidirectional therapeutic mode by promoting intracellular survival
pathways in mDA neurons as well as by modulating toxic environments surrounding these neurons.
Nurr1 belongs to the family of steroid nuclear hormone receptors
whose activities are largely regulated by co-regulators in the form of
repressor (NCoR) and activator (NCoA) complexes (Xu et al, 1999).
This suggests that a sufficient therapeutic effect, if any effect
occurred at all, might not be achieved with Nurr1 alone in the
absence of co-activators. We and others have recently shown that
Foxa2 of the forkhead family of winged-helix transcription factors
(also known as hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta, HNF3b) is a potent
co-activator of the effect of Nurr1 on the production of mDA
neurons (Lee et al, 2010; Yi et al, 2014) and their maintenance
(Stott et al, 2013) during midbrain development. It is noteworthy
that expression of Foxa2, like Nurr1, continues in adult mDA
neurons after the termination of development. As in Nurr1-knockout
mice, DA neuronal death is evident in the midbrains of Foxa2
haplo-insufficiency mice (Kittappa et al, 2007). These findings,
collectively, suggest that Nurr1 and Foxa2 act together in the adult
midbrain to protect mDA neurons. In this study, we evaluated the
therapeutic potential of co-expressing Nurr1 and Foxa2 in the
degenerating midbrains of a mouse PD model.

Results
Nurr1 and Foxa2 interact to protect mDA neurons against
toxic insult
Confocal microscopic analysis on the midbrains of adult mice
(10 weeks old) demonstrated that Nurr1 and Foxa2 were present in
the nuclei of virtually all tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive mDA
neurons (Fig 1A and B) with high colocalization indices (Fig 1C). In
immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments using midbrain lysates of 10week-old mice, Foxa2 was detected in Nurr1 antibody precipitates
and Nurr1 was also detected in Foxa2 antibody precipitates
(Fig 1D), demonstrating physical binding between Nurr1 and Foxa2
in the adult midbrain. Close physical interaction of these two
proteins was confirmed by an in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA),
which allows visualization of protein–protein binding by the red
fluorescence (554 nm) emanating from two proteins in close proximity (Fig 1E). These findings collectively suggest an interplay
between Nurr1 and Foxa2 that promotes mDA neuron functions in
the adult midbrain, like those seen in the developing midbrain (Lee
et al, 2010; Stott et al, 2013; Yi et al, 2014).
Midbrain-type DA neurons co-expressing endogenous Nurr1 and
Foxa2 were generated by in vitro differentiation of neural precursor
cells (NPCs) derived from the ventral midbrain (VM) (Fig 1F, reference Yi et al, 2014); the characteristics of these cultures are
described further in Supplementary Fig S1. To examine the roles of
Nurr1 and Foxa2, differentiated cultures were treated with silencing
small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) for these factors. The shRNA treatments were effective in down-regulating Nurr1 and Foxa2 expression. mRNA levels of Nurr1 (relative to the shControl) were
l  0.03, 0.43  0.01, 0.84  0.03, and 0.28  0.004, in the presence of shControl, shNurr1, shFoxa2, and shNurr1 + shFoxa2,
respectively, and the corresponding Foxa2 mRNA levels were
1  0.05, 0.89  0.03, 0.45  0.06, and 0.33  0.02 (n = 3 PCRs
for each group). These results are consistent with a positive regulatory loop for Nurr1 and Foxa2 expression (Yi et al, 2014), since
Nurr1 expression was slightly decreased by shFoxa2 treatment, and

A–C Co-localization of Nurr1 and Foxa2 proteins in mDA neurons of the adult mouse midbrain. Representative confocal sections of the ventral midbrain (A) stained
with antibodies specific for TH, Nurr1, and Foxa2. The midbrains of mice at 10 weeks were cryosectioned, and stained images were taken using a confocal
microscope with z-stacks through the section thickness (12 lm). Shown in (B) are individual and merged images of TH, Nurr1, and Foxa2 staining of the boxed area

quadrant in C).

Immunoprecipitation (IP) assay for Nurr1 and Foxa2 protein binding. The ventral part of midbrains was dissected from 10-week-old mice, lysed, and subjected to
IP. Nurr1/Foxa2 protein binding was detected by WB analysis using an anti-Foxa2 antibody in immunoprecipitates generated with anti-Nurr1 antibody (left), as
well as by anti-Nurr1 WB assay in immunoprecipitates with anti-Foxa2 antibody (right).

Physical interaction between Nurr1 and Foxa2 was further assessed by a proximity ligation assay (PLA). The SN area of a midbrain section (10 weeks old) was

Foxa2 expression was slightly decreased by shNurr1 treatment.
Most importantly, DA neuronal numbers were synergistically
decreased by Nurr1 and Foxa2 knockdown: TH+ cells at 3 days after
the shRNA treatments were 1,235  17 (shControl), 816  13
(shNurr1), 805  14 (shFoxa2), and 276  7 cells/well
(shNurr1 + shFoxa2) (n = 4 culture wells in each group), indicating
that Nurr1 and Foxa2 cooperate in promoting mDA neuronal
survival. Treatment with the free radical-producing chemical H2O2
caused mDA neuronal death. The loss of TH+ mDA neurons in
response to H2O2 was increased in cultures treated with shNurr1 or

shFoxa2, and this was accompanied by increased numbers of
cells with cleaved (activated) caspase-3 (Fig 1G). The effect of
combined shNurr1 + shFoxa2 treatment was even more dramatic.
Indeed, although a few cells remained immunoreactive for TH in
the cultures treated with shNurr1 + shFoxa2, all had blunted
or fragmented neurites (Fig 1G inset), a neuronal aging and
degenerative phenotype (Hof & Morrison, 2004). Because of the
developmental roles of Nurr1 and Foxa2 in mDA neuron generation (Yi et al, 2014), the observed effects of shNurr1 + shFoxa2
might have been obtained by affecting mDA neurogenesis.

However, we did not detect any new neuron formation in the
differentiated cultures (Supplementary Fig S1A–C), and shNurr1
and shFoxa2 treatment did not alter neurogenesis in BrdU-pulse
experiments (Supplementary Fig S1C). Collectively, these findings
suggest that Nurr1 and Foxa2 interact physically and functionally
in mDA neurons to protect these neurons from toxic insults, and
their neuroprotective effects are probably mediated in a cellautonomous manner since these factors are actually present in
the neurons.

Nurr1 and Foxa2 protein levels decrease in mDA neurons during
aging and degeneration
Aging is a crucial predisposing factor for PD (Moghal et al, 1994).
Interestingly, both Nurr1 and Foxa2 levels were significantly lower
in the individual mDA neurons of old mice (18 months) than in
their young counterparts (10 weeks) (Fig 2A). In agreement with
this, Nurr1 and Foxa2 levels also gradually declined in cultured
mDA neurons during the late period of culture (6–34 days after

A–C Nurr1 and Foxa2 protein levels in mDA neurons decrease in the midbrains of old mice in vivo (A) and in vitro after long-term culture (B and C). (A) Nurr1 and Foxa2
protein levels were compared in individual mDA neurons of the midbrains of young (10 weeks) and old mice (18 months) of the same mouse strain (C57BL/6,
male). All the midbrain sections were immunofluorescently co-stained with Nurr1/TH (upper) and Foxa2/TH (lower) under identical conditions, and levels of Nurr1
and Foxa2 proteins were determined in individual TH+ mDA neurons by measuring mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) using LAS image analysis (Leica). Dots in the
graphs represent the Nurr1 and Foxa2 MFI values of individual TH+ DA neurons in the SN of each animal. The average MFI values (indicated by horizontal lines) of
three animals from each group were compared (***P = 5.25E-88 for Nurr1 intensity, 5.57E-40 for Foxa2 intensity, one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc
test). Nurr1 and Foxa2 protein levels were also quantified in cultured mDA neurons over 6–34 days in vitro by Western blotting (B) and by immunocytochemical
analysis (C). Significantly lower MFI values on day 24 of culture (D24) compared to D12 at *P = 0.027 (Nurr1), *P = 0.012 (Foxa2), n = 60–70 TH+ cells from two
cultures in each group, unpaired Student’s t-test.
D, E Loss of Nurr1 and Foxa2 expression in mDA neurons after treatment with the neurotoxin MPTP (or MPP+). Mice (10 weeks old) were treated with MPTP for 5 days
as described in Materials and Methods. Three days after the last MPTP injection, Nurr1 and Foxa2 protein levels in the TH+ mDA neurons of the MPTP-treated SN
were compared with in the mDA neurons of untreated mice (D) (***P = 5.47E-103 for Nurr1 intensity, 1.53E-111 for Foxa2 intensity, one-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni post hoc test.). The effects of neurotoxin treatment were also determined in mDA neuron cultures treated with MPP+ (250 lM, 8 h, E). *P = 0.015
(% Nurr1+/TH+ cells), *P = 0.018 (% Foxa2+/TH+ cells), unpaired Student’s t-test.

onset of differentiation in vitro; Fig 2B), ultimately giving rise to
abundant TH+ cells negative for Nurr1/Foxa2 (% Nurr1+ of TH+
cells: 90.5% at D12 versus 14.3% at D24 and %Foxa2+ of TH+ cells:
91.3% at D12 versus 12.9% at D24, Fig 2C). These findings are
consistent with the decreased Nurr1 levels in the SN of elderly
persons (Chu et al, 2002) and also imply that loss of Foxa2 is an
additional aspect of the aging process in mDA neurons.
1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and its
active metabolite 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) specifically
induce mDA neuron degeneration. A decline in Nurr1 and Foxa2
protein levels was evident in TH+ mDA neurons of mice (10 weeks
old) after MPTP treatment (Fig 2D). The toxin-induced loss of Nurr1
and Foxa2 was also seen in TH+ mDA neurons in vitro before any
obvious loss of mDA neurons was detected (Fig 2E). These findings
taken together indicate that decrease in Nurr1 and Foxa2 expression
is a manifestation of cellular aging and degeneration of mDA
neurons, and thus, forced expression of these factors might be a
therapeutic option for protecting mDA neurons against degenerative
processes in PD.
Forced Nurr1 and Foxa2 expression protects mDA neurons
against toxic insults in mDA neuron–glia cultures
To test the therapeutic potential of forced Nurr1/Foxa2 expression,
we used primary mDA neuron–glia cultures derived from the mouse
VM (Fig 3A), which reflect the in vivo cellular composition and
environment of the midbrain. The cultures were transduced with
lentiviruses expressing Nurr1, Foxa2, Nurr1 + Foxa2, or control
empty vector (control). Numbers of DA neurons 5 days after transduction (days in vitro, DIV 15) were significantly increased in the
Nurr1- or Foxa2-transduced cultures. The number of viable DA
neurons was the greatest after transduction of Nurr1 + Foxa2
(control, 1,136  819; Nurr1, 1,533  19; Foxa2, 1,766  21;
Nurr1 + Foxa2, 1,939  22 cells/well, n = 4 culture wells in each
group). Numbers of TH+ DA neurons decreased with increasing
H2O2 dose. Introduction of Nurr1 and Foxa2 additively or synergistically prevented the H2O2-induced loss of TH+ cells (Fig 3B, left).
Nurr1 and Foxa2 exerted a similar protective effect against the
parkinsonism toxins MPP+ and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)
(Fig 3B, middle and right).
Glia expressing Nurr1 + Foxa2 secrete molecules that protect
mDA neurons via Nrf2-mediated anti-oxidation
Most previous works (Le et al, 1999; Kadkhodaei et al, 2009, 2013;
Volakakis et al, 2010; Malewicz et al, 2011; Decressac et al, 2012)
have suggested that Nurr1 and Foxa2 in mDA neurons exert cellautonomous cell survival/protective effects, and this view is
supported by the knockdown experiments shown in Fig 1G.
However, in agreement with previous studies (Saijo et al, 2009),
lentivirus-mediated transgene expression was detected in only a
few TH+ DA neurons, but in many more GFAP+ or Iba-1+ glial cells,
indicating that the cytoprotective effects observed in our
gain-of-function experiments, at least, were not mediated by
cell-autonomous actions of Nurr1 and Foxa2, but probably in an
extrinsic manner by Nurr1- and Foxa2-expressing glia. This hypothesis is consistent with the study of Saijo et al (2009), demonstrating
a paracrine neuroprotective effect of Nurr1. To test for a potential

paracrine action, we transduced glia (astrocytes + microglia derived
from midbrains) with Nurr1, Foxa2, Nurr1 + Foxa2, or control, and
medium conditioned in the glia was added to primary mDA neuron
cultures (Fig 3C). Conditioned medium (CM) from Nurr1transduced glia (Nurr1-CM) and Foxa2-transduced glia (Foxa2-CM)
exerted a neuroprotective effect (Fig 3D). The neuroprotective effect
by the CM prepared from Nurr1 + Foxa2-transduced glia
(Nurr1 + Foxa2-CM) was more dramatic than those of Nurr1-CM
and Foxa2-CM.
Levels of ROS in H2O2-treated mDA neuron cultures were greatly
reduced by pre-treatment with Nurr1 + Foxa2-CM (Fig 3E). In a
super-array analysis, the patterns of antioxidant gene expression in
the cultures treated with Nurr1-CM or Foxa2-CM were not greatly
different from the cultures treated with control-CM (Supplementary
Fig S2). However, expression of most of the antioxidant genes tested
was increased by Nurr1 + Foxa2-CM (Fig 3F), indicating that the
combined expression of Nurr1 + Foxa2 in glia is required to reduce
oxidative stress in neighboring mDA neurons by inducing antioxidant gene expression. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2
(Nrf2) is a master regulator of antioxidant defense via the scavenging of ROS, which acts by inducing the expression of antioxidant
genes. Upon activation, cytoplasmic Nrf2 proteins are translocated
to the nucleus where they bind to the antioxidant responsive
element (ARE) and activate transcription of a large array of antioxidant genes (for review, see Kensler et al, 2007). Nurr1 + Foxa2-CM
treatment rapidly and robustly triggered the nuclear localization of
Nrf2 in mDA neuron cultures (Fig 3G).
Molecules responsible for the paracrine neuroprotective actions
of Nurr1 and Foxa2
We next sought to identify the paracrine factors responsible for the
Nurr1- and Foxa2-mediated neuroprotection. Saijo et al (2009)
have reported that knockdown of Nurr1 aggravated mDA neuronal
death by increasing the production/release of pro-inflammatory
cytokines from activated microglia. Consistent with this, we found
that forced expression of Nurr1 in BV2 microglia led to a significant
reduction in the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines,
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), inducible nitric oxide (NO)
synthase (iNOS), and interleukin-1b (IL-1b) upon exposure to the
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
(Fig 4A, upper). Interestingly, a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression was also evident in Foxa2-expressing microglia,
indicating that Foxa2 alone, without interacting with Nurr1, can exert
an anti-inflammatory action. Regulation of inflammatory responses
by Foxa2 has also been shown in other tissues (Lappalainen et al,
2005; Tang et al, 2013). Importantly, Nurr1 and Foxa2 synergism
was very dramatic, and transcripts of the pro-inflammatory
cytokines were undetectable or barely detected after LPS treatment
of Nurr1 + Foxa2-expressing BV2 cells (Fig 4A, upper). In line with
the gene expression results, NO levels in the CM from the
Nurr1 + Foxa2-transduced microglia were lower than in the CM
from control microglia (Fig 4B). As well as microglia, astrocytes
can create an inflammatory environment by releasing proinflammatory molecules (van Noort & Bsibsi, 2009; Gorina et al,
2011), and similar patterns of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression
decrease were seen in primary astrocytes transduced with Nurr1
and Foxa2 (Fig 4A, lower). S100b, a soluble protein released from

advanced glycation end products (RAGE) pathways (Hofmann
et al, 1999; Villarreal et al, 2011). Previous studies have shown
that both S100b and RAGE increase in PD patients and MPTPtreated mice, and contribute to the damage to mDA neurons
(Muramatsu et al, 2003; Sathe et al, 2012). We found that
Nurr1 + Foxa2 expression in astrocytes significantly decreased
S100b and RAGE levels (Fig 4A, lower).

Glial cells can be polarized into alternative phenotypes (the
“alternative” M2 phenotype), versus the detrimental M1 phenotype
resulting from classical activation. The M2 phenotype can create a
beneficial environment for neurons by secretion of neurotrophic
factors such as neurotrophin 3 (NT3), brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), erythropoietin, thioredoxin, transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), sonic
hedgehog (SHH) from astrocytes (Trendelenburg & Dirnagl, 2005),

and insulin-like growth factor 1/2 (IGF1/2) and BDNF from microglia (Suh et al, 2013). The observation of Nrf2 activation and
expression of antioxidant genes in mDA neurons after Nurr1 + Foxa2CM treatment (Fig 3F and G) suggest that the Nurr1- and Foxa2mediated paracrine actions involve the release of neurotrophic
factors, because these factors are major cytokines activating Nrf2
via the MAPK and PI3K pathways (for review, see Lee & Johnson,
2004; Weissmiller & Wu, 2012). Indeed, primary astrocytes transduced with Nurr1 and/or Foxa2 expressed significantly elevated
levels of mRNAs for the trophic factors BDNF, NT3, GDNF, SHH,
erythropoietin, thioredoxin, and TGF-b (Fig 4A, lower). The effect
of the combination of Nurr1 + Foxa2 on expression of BDNF, NT3,
SHH, and IGF-1 was also evident in BV2 microglia (Fig 4A, upper).
The anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4/IL-13 trigger M2 polarization
of microglia by inducing arginase 1, CD206, and interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) (Hu et al, 2012). Upon IL-4 treatment, the
expression of M2 markers (Fig 4A), as well as arginase enzyme
activity (Fig 4C), was greatly increased in Nurr1 + Foxa2transduced BV2 cells. These findings suggest that Nurr1 and Foxa2
in glia additively/synergistically exert neuroprotective effects on
mDA neurons via two paracrine pathways: (i) decreasing the
production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and (ii)
enhancing the synthesis and secretion of neurotrophic factors.
Therapeutic potential of AAV-mediated gene delivery of Nurr1
and Foxa2 in the mouse model of PD
Based on our in vitro data, we examined whether forced expression
of Nurr1 and Foxa2 could forestall degeneration of mDA neurons in
PD. To this end, we chose the best-characterized MPTP mouse PD
model (Beal, 2001) using a subchronic systemic approach (MPTP
injection of 30 mg/kg, i.p., for five consecutive days) and the adenoassociated viral (AAV) system for gene delivery (schematized in
Fig 5A and O). Because of AAV’s low immunogenicity, lack of cytotoxic response, and ability to infect non-dividing cells, clinical trials
using it are currently underway in many disorders including PD (for
reviews, see McCown, 2011; Weinberg et al, 2013). By injecting

green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing AAVs into mouse
midbrains, we confirmed expression of the transgene in our target cells
expressing TH (DA neurons), GFAP (astrocyte), and Iba-1 (microglia) (Supplementary Fig S3).
Intraperitoneal injection of MPTP leads to a gradual but massive
loss of DA neurons in the midbrain: approximately 80–90% of TH+
mDA neurons have been lost 2 months after MPTP injection. DA
neuronal losses on the two sides were not significantly different. In this
bilateral PD model, AAVs expressing Nurr1 and/or Foxa2 were
injected into one side (right) of each midbrain (3 days prior to MPTP
treatment), whereas the other side (left) was injected with controlAAVs carrying empty vector. The cytoprotective effect by injection of
AAVs expressing the combination of Nurr1 + Foxa2 was very
dramatic, consistent, and reproducible. Without exception, TH+ DA
neuron numbers on the Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV-injected side were greater
than those on the control side (at least > 2.6-fold, n = 7, P = 0.000078,
paired t-test) (Fig 5B and Supplementary Fig S4A), and there was a
similar difference in Nissl-stained and NeuN+ neuronal numbers
between the Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV- and control-AAV-injected sides
(Supplementary Fig S5). The average number of TH+ DA neurons after
2 months was 6,594 cells on the Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV-injected side
versus 2,124 cells on the control side. Based on the average TH+ cell
number counted in MPTP-untreated midbrains (8,143 cells), our TH+
cell counts indicate that 69% of mDA neurons were rescued from
MPTP-induced degeneration by Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV. Injection of
Nurr1-AAV or Foxa2-AAV alone had much less effect than the
combined treatment (Supplementary Fig S4A). In accord with the
in vitro findings shown in Fig 4A, the transcript and protein levels of
the cytotoxic mediators S100b and GFAP were greatly reduced on the
Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV-injected sides of the midbrain (Supplementary
Fig S6A and B). In addition, mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory
cytokines IL-1b and iNOS were significantly lower in the
Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV-injected sides than those of the control sides,
while the expressions of BDNF, NT3, SHH, and TGF-b were greater
in the Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV-injected sides (Supplementary Fig S6C).
Nigrostriatal DAergic innervation was also substantially protected on
the Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV-injected side, as shown by the TH+ fiber

Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV injected versus 14 on the control side) (Fig 5C
and Supplementary Fig S4B). Consequently, the mice displayed
massive rotatory behaviors toward the Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV-injected
side (right, clockwise) when the DA receptor agonist apomorphine
was i.p. injected (Fig 5D). Furthermore, when locomotor activity was
estimated by the cylinder test 8 weeks after MPTP treatment, the
mice injected with Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV on the right side (controlAAV on the left side) used their left forelimbs more often when rearing against a wall than did the mice injected with control-AAV on
both sides (Fig 5E), while the numbers of right forelimb contacts
were not significantly different between the groups (46.5  6.9

injection on the behaviors of MPTP-treated mice, because both sides
of the SN are commonly affected in PD patients. Along with its
strong protective effects on mDA neurons and striatal DA fiber
innervation (Fig 5F–I), bilateral Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV injection
substantially protected the behaviors assessed by the pole (Fig 5J),
beam (Fig 5K), and locomotor (Fig 5L) tests. Another issue is maintenance of the therapeutic effect. AAV-delivered transgene expression was sustained for up to 6 months (Fig 5M), and
Nurr1 + Foxa2-mediated cytoprotective effects were evident 1 year
after gene delivery (Fig 5N). In most cases, treatment starts in PD
patients undergoing progressive degenerative process. We therefore
examined the effect of Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV on midbrains already
undergoing degeneration. To do this, Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAVs were
injected 2 days after the initial injection of MPTP (Fig 5O). Around
40% of mDA neurons in the midbrains were lost during days 1–5

Figure 6. Schematic representation of mDA neuron survival promoted by forced Nurr1 + Foxa2 gene delivery.
Nurr1 and Foxa2 are endogenously expressed in mDA neurons and promote cell survival in a cell-autonomous manner (left). Expression of Nurr1 and Foxa2 is reduced in
mDA neurons during aging and degenerative processes. In addition, glia come to be polarized toward the harmful M1-type. DA neurons with reduced Nurr1/Foxa2
expression are more vulnerable to the toxic environment in the aged or degenerating midbrain (middle). Forced expression of Nurr1 + Foxa2 in mDA neurons promotes their
survival. In addition, Nurr1 + Foxa2 transgene expression in glial cells (M2-type) creates a neuroprotective environment by suppressing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines as well as promoting neurotrophic factor release (right).

after MPTP treatment, and TH+ cell numbers on the right side
(Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV injected) were not different from those on the
left side (C-AAV injected) on day 5 after MPTP treatment (Fig 5P),
probably because expression of the exogenous Nurr1 and Foxa2
from the AAVs takes several days. DA neuron numbers on the left
side declined greatly by days 5–14 (from 4,629 cells on day 5 to
1,904 cells on day 14; 2,725 mDA neuron lost). By contrast, 4,056
TH+ mDA neurons on the Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV-injected right
side of the midbrain survived on day 14, resulting in the loss
of only 682 mDA neurons on days 5–14. The Nurr1 + Foxa2mediated neuroprotective effect was further detected up to
2 months (Fig 5P). Based on these findings, we propose that AAVmediated Nurr1 + Foxa2 gene delivery is a promising therapeutic
tool in PD.

Discussion
Current symptomatic treatments of PD cannot halt disease progression. To overcome this limitation, disease-modifying strategies are
being sought. Discouraging results have been obtained in clinical
trials of neurotrophic factors in the treatment of neurologic disorders (Thoenen & Sendtner, 2002). While there are many possible
reasons for these failures, there is a consensus that the delivery of
cytokines and chemicals to their desired neuronal targets within the
central nervous system is a challenge. Even local administration of
trophic factors directly to the vicinity of the desired site appeared to
give discouraging outcomes due to inefficient diffusion to the target
site (Thoenen & Sendtner, 2002; Sherer et al, 2006). Furthermore,
adverse side effects can be expected from systemic administration
and/or broad-spectrum action of candidate agents. These difficulties
prompt an alternative approach involving manipulating factors associated with neurotrophic or cytoprotective processes in mDA
neurons at the gene levels, for example, by exploiting transduction
by viral vectors.

ª 2015 The Authors

In the current study, we examined the combined expression of
Nurr1 and Foxa2 as a therapeutic tool for PD. The rationale for this
was as follows. First, both factors are expressed in the mDA neurons
of the adult SN and interact to promote the survival of these
neurons and protect them against toxic insults. However, the levels
of these factors decrease during aging and degeneration. Forced
expression of the genes, which are associated with target functions
in normal physiology, but lost in pathologic states, would be an
appropriate option for the therapeutic development. Genomewide
profiling studies have demonstrated that PD pathology is associated
with broad transcriptional dysregulation (Cooper-Knock et al,
2012). Thus, the decreased Nurr1 and Foxa2 levels observed could
be interpreted as part of the context of PD pathology. a-Synuclein,
clumps of which are hallmarks of PD, has been suggested as an
important cause of the perturbation of gene transcription in PD
(McLean et al, 2000; Specht et al, 2005; Decressac et al, 2012).
Specifically, a-synuclein accumulation is associated with the downregulation of the transcription factors critical for neuronal survival,
including Nurr1, myocyte enhancer factor-2D, DNA methyltransferase 1, and the transcription factor EB (Chu et al, 2011; Desplats
et al, 2011; Decressac et al, 2012, 2013a). In addition, other factors
related to oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions may directly
or indirectly influence protein levels via protein degradation (Jo
et al, 2009; Lin et al, 2012).
Second, the strategy proposed in this study would be less hazardous as it is without tumorigenic side effects. Gene therapy with
molecules involved in survival pathways, for example, Akt-mTOR,
has been suggested for PD (Ries et al, 2006; Kim et al, 2011, 2012).
However, most of these signaling molecules are involved in a broad
spectrum of cellular events, including the cell cycle. By contrast,
Nurr1 and Foxa2 are rather specific for the development, maintenance, and survival of mDA neurons in the midbrain, and their
tumorigenic potential is expected to be quite low, given the strong
cell cycle arrest induced by their overexpression (Castro et al, 2001;
Lee et al, 2010; Liu et al, 2012).

Third, in addition to their protective roles in mDA neurons,
forced expression of Nurr1 and Foxa2 in glial cells shifts the
diseased environment surrounding mDA neurons in the midbrain
toward a therapeutic one by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine
levels as well as by increasing neurotrophic cytokine release.
Because of this, the combined expression of Nurr1 + Foxa2 could
become an ideal and prospective therapeutic approach, and one
superior to strategies involving exclusively intrinsic or extrinsic
modes of action. Epigenetic regulation by Nurr1 and Foxa2 may
possibly involve the regulation of the pro-inflammatory/trophic
factor expression. In addition to the trans-repressive role of Nurr1
(Saijo et al, 2009), we have shown that Nurr1 and Foxa2 activate
gene transcription epigenetically by opening chromatin structures
by histone acetylation and methylation (Yi et al, 2014). Consistent
with this, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors increase neurotrophic factor release from glia cells (Peng et al, 2005; Chen et al,
2006, 2012; Wu et al, 2008). Furthermore, the H3K27me3 histone
demethylase, Jumonji domain containing 3 (jmjd3), is essential for
microglia polarization toward the M2 type expressing neurotrophic
factors (Tang et al, 2014), and jmjd3 mRNA in BV2 microglia was
up-regulated by the combined Nurr1 and Foxa2 expression (Supplementary Fig S7).
AAVs are very poorly immunogenic and thus persist for years as
extrachromosomal episomes. AAVs (serotype 2) are predominantly
being used in current gene therapeutic trials, because of their
proven efficacy and safety (for reviews, see McCown, 2011; Terzi &
Zachariou, 2008). Thus with a clinical trial in mind, we used the
AAV vector system for Nurr1 and Foxa2 gene delivery into the PD
mouse SN. We showed that AAV-mediated transgene expression
was efficiently induced in the midbrain SN over a prolonged period
(at least 6 months) and that combined Nurr1 + Foxa2 transgene
expression strongly protected mDA neurons from MPTP neurotoxin
and restored behaviors associated with nigrostriatal DA neurotransmission. The neuroprotective effect of Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV gene
delivery was not only dramatic (ca 70% of mDA neurons were
protected from MPTP-induced neurodegeneration), but also completely reproducible: Numbers of surviving TH+ DA neurons in the SN
injected with Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV were always far greater than in
the control SN. AAV-induced transgene expression was detected in
all types of cells in the midbrain—neurons, astrocytes, and microglia—in our specific experimental conditions. However, consistent
with the acknowledged neurotropism of AAVs (reviewed in
McCown et al, 1996), AAV-mediated transgene expression was preferentially detected in mDA neurons, while the proportion of glial
cells expressing the transgene was not high: 1 week after GFPexpressing AAV injection, 7.2  0.9% and 1.4  0.3% out of total
GFP+ cells in the SN regions were positive for GFAP and Iba-1,
respectively, while 66.4  4.6% of GFP+ cells expressed TH (n = 5
sections). The development of vector systems with better glial
tropism may be required to improve the ability of Nurr1 + Foxa2 to
create a neuroprotective environment surrounding degenerating
mDA neurons. Despite the observed low infectivity of glia, a significant anti-inflammatory change (with decreased pro-inflammatory
cytokine and increased neurotrophic factor expression) could be
obtained by Nurr1 + Foxa2-AAV injection (Supplementary Fig S6).
It is well known that marker expression varies in glial cells and
often changes in response to altered environments (for reviews, see
Allaman et al, 2011; Sofroniew, 2009). Thus, it has been suggested

520

Sang-Min Oh et al

that the detection of glial cells by immunostaining with specific antibodies is problematic (Emsley & Macklis, 2006). In fact, a proportion
of AAV-infected GFP+ cells (26%) remained unidentified by our
specific immunostaining procedure (TH, GFAP, Iba-1). Thus, it is
quite possible that more glial cells expressed exogenous
Nurr1 + Foxa2 than we detected by GFAP and Iba-1 immunostaining, and that the Nurr1 + Foxa2 transgenes in the identified glia,
together with the unidentified glia, were responsible for generating
a significant neuroprotective environment.
Several further issues need to be addressed for the Nurr1 + Foxa2
strategy to have real clinical value. First, the forced Nurr1 + Foxa2
effects in this study were observed after imposing a supraphysiological dose of H2O2 treatment in vitro and in an artificial
MPTP-PD mouse model. Thus, the therapeutic effects need to be
further evaluated in PD model systems that generate physiologic
levels of oxidants, and in an in vivo PD model that replicates better
the pathologies of PD, such as the genetic PD model mouse mimicking human a-synucleinopathy. Second, constitutive long-term
overexpression of Nurr1/Foxa2 may cause non-physiological perturbations of dopaminergic function. Thus, it is worth noting that, in
contrast to the study of Saijo et al (2009) that demonstrated LPSinduced Nurr1 expression in glial cells of the adult midbrain, we
were unable to detect any GFAP+ astrocytes and Iba-1+ microglia
expressing these factors (not even Nurr1 expression) either in vitro
or in vivo regardless of the presence or absence of toxic stimuli,
suggesting that the forced expression of Nurr1/Foxa2 in glia is probably not physiologic. Thus, the clinical realization of combined
Nurr1 + Foxa2 therapy absolutely requires a thorough study to rule
out potential adverse effects caused by non-physiologic expression
of Nurr1/Foxa2.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures
mDA neuron-enriched cultures
mDA neurons expressing endogenous Nurr1 and Foxa2 were
derived from short-term expanded VM-NPC cultures as described
previously (Yi et al, 2014). NPCs from the VMs of mouse embryos
(imprinting control region, ICR) at E10.5 were expanded in vitro for
3 days in serum-free N2 medium supplemented with the mitogens
basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; 20 ng/ml; R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN) and epithelial growth factor (EGF; 20 ng/ml;
R&D Systems) and then induced to differentiate by withdrawing the
mitogens. Cells were BrdU-pulsed by treating them with BrdU
(10 lM, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 16 h prior to immunostaining
with anti-BrdU and anti-TH antibodies. After 6–10 days, 10-20% of
the total cells were mDA neurons expressing mature neuron- and
midbrain-type DA neuron-specific markers (Fig 1F, Supplementary
Fig S1; Yi et al, 2014). In gain-of-function analyses for Nurr1 and
Foxa2, primary cultures of DA neurons were established from
mouse VM tissue. Briefly, VMs at E13-14 were triturated to single
cells with trypsin–EDTA and plated on culture dishes pre-coated
with poly-D-lysine (PDL; 25 lg/ml; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in neurobasal medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with
B27 and L-glutamine (Life Technologies). Ara-C (10 lM; Sigma) was
added for days 3–5 to eliminate proliferating glial cells.

Glial cultures
Primary cultures for mixed astrocytes and microglia were derived
from the VMs of mice (ICR) pups on postnatal day 1, using the
protocol previously described (Saura, 2007). In brief, VMs were
removed, triturated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM; Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT), and plated in 75-cm2 T-flasks. When
cell confluence reached 80–90%, the glia were harvested with 0.1%
trypsin and prepared for use by plating on PDL-coated culture
surfaces. Pure astrocytes were isolated from mouse VMs on postnatal day 5–7 and cultured in astro-medium (Heinrich et al, 2011).
After removing microglia by gentle shaking, cells were harvested
and replated in PDL-coated dishes. BV2 microglia were cultured in
DMEM with 10% FBS (Blasi et al, 1990).
Mixed mDA neuron–glia culture
mDA neurons primarily cultured from E13–14 mouse VMs (total
cells, 8 × 104 cells) were plated on astrocyte–microglial beds
(2 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates) and cultured in B27 + L-glutaminecontaining neurobasal medium (Life Technologies).
Virus production
Lentiviral vectors expressing Nurr1 or Foxa2 under the control of
the CMV promoter were generated by inserting the respective cDNA
into the multi-cloning site of pCDH (System Biosciences, Mountain
View, CA). pGIPZ-shNurr1 and pGIPZ-shFoxa2 lentiviral vectors
were purchased from Open Biosystems (Rockford, IL). The empty
backbone vectors (pCDH or pGIPZ) were used as negative controls.
The lentiviruses were produced and used for transducing in vitro
cultures as described (Yi et al, 2014). Titers of the lentiviruses were
determined using a QuickTiterTM HIV Lentivirus Quantitation kit
(Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA), and 2 ml/6-cm dish or 200 ll/well
(24-well plates) with 106 transducing unit (TU)/ml (60–70 ng/ml)
were used for each transduction reaction. For inducing in vivo
expression by stereotaxic injection, AAVs expressing Nurr1 or Foxa2
[tagged with hemagglutinin (HA)] under the control of the CMV
promoter were generated by subcloning the respective cDNAs into
pAAV-MCS vector (Addgene, Cambridge, MA). To assess the efficiency of transgene expression, GFP-expressing AAVs were also
generated. Packaging and production of the AAVs (serotype 2) was
performed by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (Seoul,
Korea). AAV titers were determined with a QuickTiterTM AAV Quantitation kit (Cell Biolabs). Co-expression studies were carried out by
infecting cells with mixtures of the individual viral preparations

following primary antibodies: Nurr1 (1:500, rabbit, E-20, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, TX and 1:1,000, mouse, R&D Systems); Foxa2
(1:500, goat, Santa Cruz); TH (1:250, rabbit, Pel-Freez, Rogers, AR);
GFP (1:2,000, rabbit, Life Technologies); Iba-I (1:200, rabbit, Wako,
Osaka, Japan); GFAP (1:200, mouse, MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana,
CA); S100b (1:1,000, mouse, Sigma); TuJ1 (1:1,000, mouse, rabbit,
Covance, Denver, CO); microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2),
(1:200, mouse, Sigma); NeuN (1:200, mouse, Chemicon, Temecula,
CA); DA transporter (DAT, 1:500, rabbit, Abcam, Cambridge, MA);
vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2, 1:500, rabbit, PelFreeze); Pitx3 (1:200, rabbit, Life Technologies); Lmx1a (1:2,000,
rabbit, Millipore, Pittsburgh, PA); Nrf2 (1:200, rabbit, Santa Cruz);
HA (1:200, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA); cleaved
caspase-3 (1:500, mouse, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA);
and BrdU antibody(AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK). Secondary antibodies tagged with Cy3, Cy5 (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA), or Alexa488 (Life Technologies) were used
for visualization, and immunoreactive cells were analyzed under an
epifluorescence (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) or a confocal (Leica
PCS SP5) microscope. Co-localization of Nurr1 and Foxa2 proteins
in TH+ DA neuronal nuclei was assessed by Pearson’s correlation
and overlap coefficient values using the Just Another Colocalization
Plugin (JACoP) of ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). In certain cases,
TH-immunoreactive cells and fibers in midbrain and striatal sections
were visualized by peroxidase-based colorimetric staining using a
DAB substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Nissl
staining has been done using NeuroTraceR 435/455 blue fluorescent
kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) based on the manufacture’s
protocol.
Messenger RNA expression analysis
Total RNA preparation, cDNA synthesis, and RT–PCRs were carried
out using conventional methods. Real-time PCR was performed on a
CFX96TM Real-Time System using iQTM SYBR green supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Gene expression values were normalized to
those of GAPDH. Primers information is provided in Supplementary
Table S1. High-throughput gene expression profiling for oxidative
stress genes was done using a mouse oxidative stress PCR array
(cat. 330231 PAMM-065ZA) using an RT2 Profiler PCR ArrayR
(Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD).

expressing
Nurr1 + Foxa2, Nurr1, Foxa2 alone, and empty control were
prepared by lentiviral transduction. For co-expression of
Nurr1 + Foxa2, lentiviruses expressing each transgene separately
were mixed 1:1 (v:v) and added to cultures. Total viral volumes and
titers in the cultures expressing Nurr1 or Foxa2 alone were adjusted
to be same as those of the co-transduced cultures by adding control
viruses. Fresh medium was added 3 days after transduction, and
medium conditioned in the transduced glia was taken at 3-day

The paper explained

In situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA)
Nurr1/Foxa2 protein interaction in the VM was further analyzed by
PLA. Frozen slices of mouse VM tissues (10 weeks old) were treated
with primary anti-Nurr1 (1:1,000, mouse, R&D Systems) and Foxa2
antibodies (1:1,000, goat, Cell Signaling), followed by secondary
antibody, ligation, polymerization, and detection using an in situ
PLA assay kit (Olink Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden), as described
previously (Yi et al, 2014).
Measurement of ROS, NO, and arginase activity
For measurement of intracellular ROS levels, cells were incubated with 10 lM of 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-20 ,70 -dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate [CM-H2DCF-DA (herein referred to as DCF)
(Life Technologies)] for 10 min. The cells were then washed with
D-PBS (in mM: 2.68 KCl, 1.47 KH2PO4, 136.89 NaCl, and 8.1
Na2HPO4), and fluorescence and phase-contrast images were taken
using an Olympus (IX71, Hicksville, NY). The amount of nitrite
formed from NO was measured by mixing the culture medium (50 ll)
with an equal volume of Griess reagent (0.1% naphthylethylene
diamine, 1% sulfanilamide, and 2.5% H3PO4). Optical density
was measured at 540 nm. Arginase activity was measured with a
QuantiChrom Arginase Assay kit (Bioassay Systems, Hayward, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Animal care and experiments
All procedures for animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Hanyang
College of Medicine under the approval number 2013-0153A.
Animals were housed in a specific pathogen-free barrier facility with
a 12-h light/dark cycle and maintained on standard chow (5053
PicoLabR Rodent Diet 20). Animal sizes for our experiments were
determined according to our in vitro assays and a pilot test without
previous statistical calculation. Experiments were performed in
accordance with the NIH guidelines. To minimize bias, behavioral
assays have mostly been assessed by two experimenters in a
blinded fashion.

Problem
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common movement disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of dopamine (DA)-secreting neurons
(DA neurons) in the midbrain. No restorative and disease-modifying
therapies are currently available for PD. Use of the physiological
mechanisms promoting midbrain DA (mDA) neuron survival seems an
appropriate option for developing treatments for PD.
Results
We showed that Nurr1 and Foxa2, the transcription factors expressed
in midbrain DA (mDA) neurons, physiologically interact for the survival
of these neurons. However, their expressions decline during aging and
degenerative processes. In addition to cell-autonomous actions in
mDA neurons, Nurr1 + Foxa2 transgene expression in glial cells
creates a neuroprotective environment by (i) suppressing the secretion
of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as (ii) promoting neurotrophic
factor release. As a consequence of these bimodal actions, adenoassociated virus (AAV)-mediated gene delivery of Nurr1 and Foxa2 in a
PD mouse model markedly protected mDA neurons and motor deficits
associated with nigrostriatal DA neurotransmission in PD.
Impact
Based on our observations, we propose that combined Nurr1 + Foxa2
gene delivery can be a promising therapeutic tool in PD.

Histological measurement of TH-immunoreactive cells
Four weeks to 1 year after AAV injection, animals were anesthetized and perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.
Brains were removed and immersed in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight and sliced on a freezing microtome (CM 1850; Leica, Wetzlar,
Germany). Midbrain and striatal sections (30 lm thick) were
subjected to TH immunohistochemistry as described above. The
total number of mDA neurons in the right and left sides of the
midbrain was obtained by counting TH-immunoreactive cells
throughout the midbrain (a total of 11–14 sections counted for each
animal). The Abercrombie correction factor [N = n × T/(T + D)],
where N is the actual number of cells, n is the number of nuclear
profiles, T is the section thickness (30 lm), and D is the average
diameter of nuclei, was used to compensate for double counting in
adjacent sections.
Behavior tests

Stereotaxic AAV injection into MPTP-treated PD mice
Male mice (10–14 weeks old, ICR) received i.p. injections of MPTP
(20 mg/kg) once daily for five consecutive days. Three days prior to,
or 2 days after, the first MPTP injection, mixtures of Nurr1AAV + control-AAV (1 ll each, 109 particles/ll, for the Nurr1 group),
Foxa2-AAV + control-AAV (Foxa2 group), Nurr1-AAV + Foxa2AAV (Nurr1 + Foxa2 group), or 2 ll of control-AAV (control group)
were injected over a 3-min period into ventral midbrains (3.3 mm
posterior to bregma;  1.2 mm lateral to midline; 4.6 mm ventral
to dura) under anesthesia induced by Zoletil50 (0.1 mg/kg) mixed
with Rompum (93.28 lg/kg). The needle (26 gauge) was left in the
injection site for 5–10 min after completion of each injection, and
removed slowly. When inaccurate injection at the SN position was
confirmed, the mice were excluded from analysis.

The apomorphine-induced rotation test
Apomorphine (Sigma) was subcutaneously injected at a dose of
0.5 mg/kg and rotation was monitored for 60 min. The results were
expressed as net turns/60 min.
The cylinder test
Mice were placed in a small transparent cylinder (height, 15.5 cm;
diameter, 12.7 cm), and the numbers of right and left forelimb
contacts with the wall of the arena while rearing were recorded for
3 min.
The pole test
Animals were placed head upwards on top of a vertical wooden pole
50 cm in length (diameter, 1 cm). The base of the pole was placed

in the home cage. Once placed on the pole, animals oriented themselves downward and descended the length of the pole back into
their home cage. All of the animals received 2 days of training that
consisted of five trials for each session. On the test day, animals
received five trials, and the time to orient downward was measured.
