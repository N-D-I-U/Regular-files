Nurr1 is an orphan nuclear transcription factor expressed in the brain. While Nurr1 is assumed to be
an immediate early gene, it is not fully understood how Nurr1 expression is regulated in an activitydependent manner in the central nervous system. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms
underlying the regulation of Nurr1 expression in cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons. We found
that upregulation of neural activity by high KCl and bicuculline enhances Nurr1 levels, while blockade
of its activity by tetrodotoxin reduces Nurr1 levels. The induction of Nurr1 expression was mediated
by voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), as shown by cadmium and VDCC-speciﬁc inhibitors.
Furthermore, calcineurin, but not calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) was critical for
the induction. Thus, Nurr1 expression is regulated by VDCC and calcineurin in a cell-autonomous, neural
activity-dependent manner.

(Nr4a3). Nurr1 is essential for the differentiation of midbrain
dopaminergic neurons [6,34], and sustained Nurr1 expression is
essential to maintain the expression of genes in dopaminergic neurons in the adult mouse midbrain [17].
Nurr1+/− mice have decreased dopamine levels in the brain
[16], and exhibit hyperactive behaviors potentially relevant
to schizophrenia [24,31,33]. Importantly, gene mutations were
reported in the Nurr1 allele in schizophrenia patients [1,5,9].
Nr4a genes are not only expressed in dopaminergic neurons,
but also in cortical and hippocampal neurons [2,32]. Studies with
glial cells [25], immune cells [27], and other cell types of peripheral
tissues have reported diverse roles of Nurr1 [23]. Nurr1 may play

H. Tokuoka et al. / Neuroscience Letters 559 (2014) 50–55

a role in learning and memory as suggested by Nurr1 gene knockdown experiments [10,13,14].
NR4a family members are supposed to be immediate early
genes. NGFI-B (NR4a1) was originally identiﬁed as an immediate
early gene, which was rapidly activated by serum stimulation of
quiescent ﬁbroblasts [15]. Nurr1 is inducible by membrane depolarization with KCl in PC12 cells [20], and in young culture of
cerebellar granule cells [3]. Nurr1 is also induced by kainic acid
in rat brains [12]. However, it is not understood well how Nurr1
gene expression is regulated in an activity-dependent manner in
CNS neurons. Thus, we investigated the mechanisms underlying
the regulation of Nurr1 gene expression in central neurons.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cell culture
Dissociated cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared
from embryonic day 16 mice (C57Bl/6) as described previously with
minor modiﬁcations [28,29]. Mice bearing Nurr-1 null alleles were
established from ES cell cells harboring ﬂoxed Nurr1 alleles [17]
that were electroporated with a Cre-expressing vector. Nurr1+/−
mice were intercrossed to generate Nurr1-null fetus. All animal
experiments were performed in accordance with the general guide
lines of the Tokyo Institute of Technology.
Coverslips were coated with 0.25% polyethyleneimine in 0.15 M
borate buffer (pH 8.5) overnight. Hippocampal neurons were dissociated by papain and plated with Neurobasal medium (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) containing B-27 (Life Technologies),
0.5 mM GlutaMAX I (Life Technologies) and 5% fetal bovine serum.
1 ␮M Cytosine arabinoside (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to
culture media to prevent proliferation of astrocytes at 3 or 4 DIV.
Cultured neurons were used for experiments at 13–17 DIV.
Cells were stimulated by addition of 20 ␮M bicuculline (WAKO,
Osaka, Japan) and 20 mM KCl to culture media (K+ /bic stimulation). In some experiments, the following channel blockers
were added to the culture media 5–10 min before K+ /bic stimulation: 100 ␮M CdCl2 , 10 ␮M 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione
(CNQX) (WAKO), 100 ␮M DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic
acid (DL-APV) (Sigma), 1 ␮M tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Sigma), 10 ␮M
nimodipine (Sigma), 1 ␮M -conotoxin MVIIC (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan), 0.5 ␮M -conotoxin GVIA (Peptide Institute),
or 0.1 ␮M SNK-482 (Peptide Institute). To examine intracellular
signaling, cells were pretreated with 1 ␮M cyclosporin A, 0.1 ␮M
FK506 or 1 ␮M KN-93 for 1 h before stimulation with K+ /bic.

threshold. This thresholding provided almost no positive nuclear
signal in Nurr1−/− neurons, while highlighting distinct nuclear
signals in Nurr1+/+ neurons. The same method was used for the
threshold of NeuN signals.
2.3. Western blot
For Western blot analysis, P0 mouse brains were dissected out,
and homogenized using a PelletMixer (TreffLab) in 4 × w/v buffer
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 5% sucrose, followed
by sonication and boiling. Protein concentrations were determined
with DC assay, and 20 ␮g of protein of each sample was subjected
for Western blot.
For Western blot of cultured neurons, mouse cerebral cortex
neurons from E16 embryos of C57Bl/6 J mice were cultured in 6well plates at a density of 1 × 106 per well. Cells were stimulated
as described above, collected in cold PBS, and lysed with 300 ␮l
RIPA buffer composed of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl,
1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, 1 ␮g/ml leupeptin, and 1 ␮g/ml pepstatin. After
centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, protein concentrations
were determined by Bradford protein assay, and 40 mg protein of
each sample was used for Western blot with anti-Nurr1 antibody
(1/500, Peruseus proteomics). Because Nurr1 signal from brain and
cultured neuron samples showed multiple or smear bands near 57
and 70 kD markers, we took all these bands signals for quantiﬁcation.
3. Results
3.1. Neural activity-dependent regulation of Nurr1 expression
First, we examined the expression level of Nurr1 by immunostainings and Western blot using a monoclonal antibody, which
speciﬁcally detects Nurr1 expression (Fig. 1A and B). When the
neural network activity of cultured hippocampal neurons was
enhanced by application of 20 mM KCl and 20 ␮M bicuculline
(K+ /bic), Nurr1 expression was greatly increased within 3 h (Fig. 1C
and D). This effect was also conﬁrmed by Western blot in cultured
cortical neurons (Fig. 1E).
On the other hand, the expression of Nurr1 was reduced by suppression of neural network activity with TTX for 3 h (Fig. 2A, B).
These data directly demonstrate Nurr1 expression is tightly regulated depending on neural activity in hippocampal and cortical
neurons.
3.2. VDCC-mediated regulation of Nurr1 expression

2.2. Immunocytochemistry
Immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously [28,29]. Cells were stimulated as indicated, and ﬁxed by
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature.
The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Nurr1 (1/200,
Peruseus proteomics, Tokyo), and anti-NeuN (1/500, Millipore,
Billerica, MA). The following secondary antibodies were used:
Alexa546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1/2,000, Life Technologies)
and Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1/2,000, Life Technologies). Fluorescence images were captured with a E800 microscope
(Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with 20× or 40× objective lens [numerical
aperture (NA) = 0.50, 0.90, respectively; Nikon], equipped with a
cooled CCD camera (VB-6010, Keyence, Osaka, Japan).
Fluorescence signals were quantiﬁed with Image J. For each
batch of experiment, threshold value of the Nurr1 signal was
determined from the images of neurons stimulated with K+ /bic.
Each histogram of Nurr1 images was ﬁtted with Gaussian curve,
and the averaged 10× SDabove the peak value was set as a

We next examined how neurons sense the neural activity for
Nurr1 regulation. When neurons were treated with cadmium, a
non-speciﬁc VDCC inhibitor, Nurr1 induction by K+ /bic was completely inhibited (Fig. 3A). Meanwhile, blockade of AMPA receptors,
NMDA receptors, and voltage-dependent sodium channels, by
CNQX, APV, and TTX, respectively, did not inhibit Nurr1 induction
by K+ /bic (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 3C)
We then used speciﬁc inhibitors for VDCC subtypes; nimodipine for L-type VDCC, -conotoxin MVIIC for P/Q-type and N-type
VDCC, -conotoxin GVIA for N-type VDCC, and SNX-482 for R-type
VDCC. Combinatioin of all these inhibitors completely abrogated
Nurr1 induction by K+ /bic (Fig. 3B, C), conﬁrming the essential role
of VDCC.
We examined which subtype of VDCC was important by
omitting one of those inhibitors. We found that withdrawal of
nimodipine from the four VDCC inhibitors recovered the Nurr1
induction, while removal of other single inhibitors did not (Fig. 3B).

effectively inhibited the Nurr1 induction (Fig. 3C). Combination
of nimodipine and -conotoxin GVIA or SNX-482 did not affect
Nurr1 expression (data not shown). These data indicate that Nurr1

SNX-482 (R-). Scale bar, 100 ␮m.

expression is modulated not only by L-type VDCC, but by multiple
VDCCs.
3.3. Calcineurin mediates Ca2+ signal for the regulation of Nurr1
expression
We further explored what signaling molecule mediates the Ca2+
signal downstream of VDCC. Cyclosporin A and FK506, both calcineurin inhibitors, suppressed the induction of Nurr1 by K+ /bic as
demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and Western blot (Fig. 4A
and B). On the other hand, KN-93, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase II/IV (CaMKII/IV) inhibitor, did not affect the Nurr1
induction (Fig. 4A and B). These data suggest that calcineurin is a
primary mediator of Ca2+ signal downstream of VDCC to promote
the induction of Nurr1 expression.
4. Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that Nurr1 gene is under
regulation of neural activity through VDCC and calcineurin in cultured hippocampal and cerebral cortical neurons. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that basal expression of Nurr1 is decreased when
neuronal activities are blocked by TTX. These data raise the possibility that Nurr1 expression may not always be transient, but could
be constitutive in some cells depending on a basal activity of each
neuron.

We found that VDCC is responsible for neural activitydependent regulation of Nurr1 gene, while AMPA- and NMDA-type
glutamate receptors are not directly involved. These data indicate
that Nurr1 expression is cell-autonomously regulated, and could
be variable depending on the activity of each neuron. However,
the involvement of NMDA receptor was reported previously with
young cerebellar granule cells in culture [3]. This difference may be
attributable to the difference of cell origin, or maturity of cultured
neurons, as we used relatively matured culture of hippocampal and
cerebral cortical neurons.
Different VDCC subtypes show different kinetics and localization [8], and different contribution to the total VDCC current when
recorded at soma [7]. We found that L-type VDCC was sufﬁcient for
enhancement of Nurr1 expression, while activation of other VDCC
subtypes could also induce Nurr1 expression. These data suggest
that the total amount of Ca2+ entry into cells through VDCCs, rather
than activation of a speciﬁc VDCC subtype, is an important factor
for the regulation of Nurr1 expression.
We found that calcineurin was essential for the induction of
Nurr1, while CaMK was not. CaMK is known as a primary mediator
of calcium signals to transcription of genes [4]. The involvement
of calcineurin was reported for NGFI-B induction [19], suggesting
that the VDCC-calcineurin pathway might be common for the regulation of NR4a family genes in central neurons. The downstream
factor of calcineurin which upregulates Nurr1 gene is yet to be
known. CyclicAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) can
activate Nurr1 gene transcription [30], while CREB can be activated

(A, B) Neurons were pretreated with or without 1 mM Cyclosporin A (CsA), 100 nM FK506 (both are calcineurin inhibitors), or 1 mM KN-93 (CaMK inhibitor) for 1 h, then

by calcineurin through CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2
(TORCS2) [26]. Thus, TORCS2 and CREB may be key players of Nurr1
induction downstream of calcium entry via VDCC.
Involvement of calcineurin in cognitive functions and
schizophrenia has been reported. Calcineurin-deﬁcient mice
showed deﬁcits in cognitive functions [11,22] and calcineurinA
gamma subunit gene was associated with schizophrenia [18,21].
Thus, our data raise a possibility that defect in the calcineurin gene
may exert cognitive dysfunction through suppression of Nurr1
expression.
5. Conclusion
Nurr1 expression in the CNS neurons is regulated by neural
activity, through voltage-dependent calcium channels and calcineurin.
