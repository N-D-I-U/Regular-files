ABSTRACT

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules, with essential functions in RNA silencing
and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. MiRNAs appear to regulate the development
and function of the nervous system. Alterations of miRNA expression have been associated with
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To characterize the AD miRNA signature we examined genome wide

RI
PT

miRNA and mRNA expression patterns in the temporal cortex of AD and control samples. We
validated our miRNA results by semi-quantitative real-time PCR in independent prefrontal cortex.
Further, we separated grey and white matter brain sections to identify the cellular origin of the altered

SC

miRNA expression. We observed genome wide downregulation of hsa-miR-132-3p and hsa-miR-2123p in AD with a stronger decrease in grey matter AD samples. We further identified ten differently
expressed transcripts achieving genome wide levels of significance. Significantly deregulated miRNAs

and mRNAs were correlated and examined for potential binding sites (in silico). This miRNome-wide
study in AD provides supportive evidence and corroborates an important contribution of miR-132/212

1. INTRODUCTION

Late-onset sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a genetically complex multi-factorial neurodegenerative
disease, is the most common form of dementia affecting millions of people worldwide. Although recent
genome wide association studies and meta-analysis identified a considerable number of susceptibility
gene variants for sporadic late-onset AD, there is still insufficient knowledge concerning the nature of

RI
PT

genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that trigger the mechanisms ultimately leading to cell death and
neurodegeneration. With the advance of new technologies, however, recent research turned towards
the exploration of epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modification and DNA-methylation/-

SC

hydroxymethylation as well as non-coding RNA associated gene silencing (Fischer, 2014).

MicroRNAs (miRNA, ~18-25 nucleotides), the largest family of small non-coding RNAs, enable a
tightly balanced modulation of gene-expression at the post-transcriptional level. This regulation largely

M
AN
U

depends on the grade of sequence complementarity between miRNAs and corresponding mRNA
targets. In principle, one particular miRNA regulates multiple mRNAs and one specific mRNA is
regulated by several miRNAs (BARTEL, 2004). Thus, dysregulation of one miRNA can cause
alterations of several different cellular and developmental processes and contribute to the
development of a variety of diseases. Interestingly, some miRNAs have also been described in AD

TE
D

(Lau et al., 2014; Satoh, 2012). For example, miR-107 as well as miR-29b target beta-site APP
cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), an essential protease involved in the amyloidogenic processing of APP
as observed in brains of AD patients (Hébert et al., 2008; Nelson and Wang, 2010) and miR-16 was

EP

shown to inhibit APP expression in mice (Liu et al., 2012). In addition, miR-132 was reported to play a
key role in tau-metabolism, as it regulates exon splicing of tau (Hébert et al., 2012), co-localizes with

AC
C

hyper-phosphorylated tau and negatively correlates with NFT bearing neurons from cortical tissue
(Lau et al., 2013).

In this study, we analyzed expression patterns of more than 1 200 miRNAs in the temporal cortex (TC)
of 64 samples, including 39 AD and 25 control brains. Two miRNAs, to hsa-miR-132-3p
(MIMAT0000426) and hsa-miR-212-3p (MIMAT0000269) showed a genome wide significant
downregulation in AD as compared to control brain. Downregulation was verified in additional brain
regions and an independent sample. To delineate the primary source of altered miRNA expression
signals we further analyzed grey and white matter brain material separately and assessed
associations with disease progression. We also examined genome wide mRNA expression to identify
likely target genes of miR-132/212.

Samples

2.1.1.

Human brain samples and ethics statement

The initial miRNA screen was carried out in temporal cortex of 64 fresh frozen post-mortem human
brain samples provided by the Brain Bank Munich, Germany (MUC cohort). Temporal (TC) and

RI
PT

prefrontal cortex (PFC) of eight age and gender matched AD and control pairs selected from MUC
cohort were used for validation experiment (MUC validation set). Additionally, we obtained fresh
frozen post-mortem PFC from a second sample set containing 225 AD samples and 87 cognitively

SC

healthy controls provided by The Netherland Brain Bank (NBB validation set) for independent
validation. From the latter cohort, eight age-matched female AD and control pairs were selected for
grey and white matter separation (NBB grey/white matter set). Complete sample characteristics are

summarized in Table 1 and Table S1. AD patients have been clinically diagnosed according to the
NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al., 1984). Human brain tissues provided by Brain Bank Munich
(Center for Neuropathology and Prion Research LMU, Munich; coordinating the European brain tissue
bank (BNE) and the German national brain tissue bank (BrainNet)) or by The Netherland Brain Bank
(Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Amsterdam) have been collected from donors for or from

AC
C

Total RNA (>18nt) was extracted from human brain tissue using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen)
according to manufacturer’s protocol including on-column DNA digestion with RNase free DNase Set
(Qiagen). In brief, we homogenized 50-100mg tissue in 700µl QIAzol (Qiagen) and eluted total RNA
within 30µl RNase-free water. Observed RNA integrity numbers for the samples were in the expected
range according to literature (Lukiw et al., 2012).

2.2.2.

Genome wide miRNA expression profiling

Total RNA (500ng) from TC of MUC cohort was hybridized to microfluid biochip Geniom Biochip Homo
sapiens h_v16 plus, (febit biomed GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
The microarray covered more than 1 200 mature microRNA sequences as annotated in Sanger

miRBase 16 (www.mirbase.org) (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2006) and several additional proprietary human
miRNA sequences that had been discovered by deep sequencing. Signal intensities were measured
using Geniom RT Analyzer (febit biomed GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) employing microfluid based
enzymatic primer extension assay technique (MPEA) as described elsewhere (Vorwerk et al., 2008).
After background correction signal intensity values were calculated for each of the miRNAs over their

RI

intra-array replicates. Quantile normalization was applied to correct for inter-array variation. Median
signal intensity was calculated for each of the miRNAs over grouped samples (AD vs. control).
miRNAs with signal intensity <50 in both groups were considered as not expressed and were excluded

SC

from further statistical analysis. Student’s T-test was executed on log2 transformed median signal
intensities to identify differently expressed miRNAs of AD versus control samples. To correct for
-05

multiple testing, a threshold of 8.16×10

was set for significant p-values (Bonferroni correction for 613

Downregulation of miR-132/212 cluster in temporal cortex of AD patients

We explored genome wide miRNA expression profiles in the temporal cortex of 39 AD patients and 25
controls obtained from the Brain Bank Munich (Table 1). By hybridizing total RNA to a Febit Geniom
Biochip utilizing MPEA-technique (Vorwerk et al., 2008), signal intensities of 1 221 mature miRNAs

annotated in miRBase release 16 (www.mirbase.org) were examined (Figure S1). Biological and
technical replicates were included as internal quality controls and were found to be highly correlated to

each other (R >0.89). After filtering for non-expressed and non-informative miRNAs, 613 miRNAs

SC

remained for further statistical analysis. Age and gender were tested as covariates in logistic
regression models but no significant effects were observed (data not shown). We further applied
student’s T-test on log2 transformed signal intensities resulting in 102 miRNAs that exceeded

AN
U

unadjusted p-values<0.05 (Table 2). From these, 41 miRNAs showed increased and 61 showed
decreased expression levels in AD samples. When comparing our results (N=102 miRNAs) with
published miRNAs (N=323 miRNAs) for which dysregulation in AD has been described (Lau et al.,
2014; Satoh, 2012), we observed an overlap for 27 miRNAs with 14 showing deregulation in the same
direction as previously described (Table 2).

EP

hsa-miR-212-3p. Both have recently been related to AD by several groups (Table 2) (Cogswell et al.,
2008; Lau et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011). We observed a rather homogeneous pattern of

downregulation of almost 60% in AD as compared to controls for both miRNAs (foldhsa-miR-132-3p=0.407;
foldhsa-miR-212-3p=0.409; Figure 1 A-B). Further, we explored a potential association of miRNA
expression levels with Braak stages (Figure 1 C-D). Using linear regression analysis, we observed a

significant decline of expression with advancing Braak stage (phsa-miR-132-3p=3.86x10 ; phsa-miR-2123p=1.13x10

).

Verification of hsa-miR-132-3p and hsa-miR-212-3p expression levels

To validate our results, we applied semi-quantitative real-time PCR (sqPCR) using different sample
sets (Table 1, Table S1). Expression patterns were (i) re-analyzed in eight age and gender matched
sample pairs from TC (MUC validation set), (ii) investigated in a second brain region (PFC) of the

same samples (MUC validation set), and (iii) validated in PFC of an independent cohort (225 AD, 87
controls) obtained from Netherland Brain Bank (NBB validation set).
For all sample sets we observed higher dCt-values indicating a consistent downregulation of both

mature miRNAs in AD as compared to controls (MUC validation set TC: phsa-miR-132-3p=2.68x10 ;

phsa-miR-212-3p=1.81x10 ; PFC: phsa-miR-132-3p=4.80x10 ; phsa-miR-212-3p=1.72x10 ; NBB validation set:

hsa-miR-132-3p and hsa-miR-212-3p are strongly downregulated in grey matter

To further delineate the origin of decreased expression, we dissected grey and white matter sections
from PFC of eight age matched pairs of female NBB samples and repeated miRNA expression
analysis using sqPCR. hsa-miR-132-3p and hsa-miR-212-3p were significantly downregulated in grey

Expression levels of neuronal-enriched miRNAs and miR-132/212 in Braak stages 0-VI

Since the observed downregulation in AD might be a result of advancing neuronal degradation during
disease progression, we compared the expression levels of miR-132/212 together with other
previously identified neuronal-enriched miRNAs (Lau et al., 2013) using our microarray data set for TC
of the MUC cohort. Across all Braak stages 0-VI we observed a considerable stronger downregulation
for hsa-miR-132 and hsa-miR-212 compared to the other neuronal-enriched miRNAs starting already
at Braak stage II (Figure S2).

Gene Expression alterations in temporal cortex of AD and control samples

We next performed mRNA expression analysis in 64 TC samples of the MUC cohort utilizing Illumina
sentrix bead arrays. After normalization and filtering we applied student’s T-test on the log2 signal
intensities of 11 264 remaining markers. In total, 3 544 markers corresponding to 3 270 genes were
found to be differentially expressed between AD and control samples (p-values<0.05) (Table S2).

Interestingly, we identified 9 down- and 10 upregulated mRNAs in our dataset from 47 genes that

Correlations between miRNA and mRNA expression

EP

Since miRNAs are known to mediate gene regulatory effects we next examined correlations between
miR-132/212 and the ten differentially expressed transcripts identified in the TC samples from MUC

AC
C

cohort. As demonstrated in Table 3, strong correlations between expression levels of these ten
mRNAs and the two miRNAs hsa-miR-132-3p and hsa-miR-212-3p were observed by linear
regression (Figure S4). Correlations for GFAP, AEBP1 and TSPAN7 even exceeded genome wide
significance for both miRNAs. Given these strong correlations between miRNA and mRNA expression
levels we screened these genes for potential miR-132/212 binding sites using online prediction tools.
Binding sites for both miRNAs were predicted in PKN2, C5ORF41 and GFAP, and a binding site for
hsa-miR-132-3p was predicted for NFKB1 according to miRWalk (Dweep et al., 2011), a
bioinformatics tool combining several prediction tools by comparative analysis. Additionally, we
analyzed potential RNA-RNA interactions of the 3’UTR of the transcript corresponding to the
appropriate Illumina Marker for each of these four mRNAs to mature miRNA sequences using

4. DISCUSSION

Using a microarray-based miRNome-wide screening we observed 102 deregulated miRNAs in
temporal cortical brain regions of AD patients compared to controls including two miRNAs, hsa-miR132-3p and hsa-miR-212-3p showing alterations exceeding the level of genome wide significance.
Remarkably, deregulations of a considerable number (~25%) of these 102 miRNAs have already been

RI
PT

described in AD (Lau et al., 2014; Satoh, 2012). However, these previous studies show rather
inconsistencies regarding types and expression patterns of the miRNAs identified. Possible reasons
may include considerable differences regarding sample sizes, brain regions and technical

SC

methodologies, which have been applied. A recent analysis by Kolbert et al. comparing different
platforms and technologies demonstrated considerable differences in miRNA transcript detection
ranging from 35% up to 70% as well as differences in expression intensities across the tested

M
AN
U

methodologies (Kolbert et al., 2013). As such, these methodological issues are most likely to explain
the discrepancies in miRNA expression patterns observed in AD so far, at least for miRNAs showing
weak to intermediate alterations of expression patterns.

We observed genome wide significant downregulation of the miR-132/212 cluster in AD, which was
confirmed by sqPCR in temporal and prefrontal cortex of the same individuals, and in PFC of an

TE
D

independent, larger sample set from the Netherland Brain Bank (NBB). It has to be mentioned that the
NBB samples are partially overlapping with those used in a previous study by Lau et al 2013, who also
observed downregulation for hsa-miR-132-3p. However, in contrast to our study Lau et al used the

prefrontal cortex.

In addition, downregulation of miR-132 and miR-212 has been described for several brain regions in
AD, as well as in cellular and mouse models for AD (Cogswell et al., 2008; Hébert et al., 2013; Lau et
al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2013). The miR-132/212 cluster is processed from a joint
primary transcript encoded by an intergenic region on chromosome 17. Our results indicate higher
expression levels and stronger downregulation for hsa-miR-132-3p compared to hsa-miR-212-3p,
which is in line with literature and might be explained by post-transcriptional regulation (Magill et al.,
2010; Wanet et al., 2012).
We observed a consistent downregulation of the miR-132/212 cluster already at early stages of AD
(Braak stage III-IV) with an advancing decline during disease progression (Braak stage>IV) in
temporal cortex (MUC cohort). Comparing these results with expression levels of other described

neuronal-enriched miRNAs revealed that downregulation of miR-132/212 appears already at very
early stages of AD and more pronounced compared to others and thus seems to be independent from
advancing loss of neurons. These observations are in line with previous findings in PFC and thereby
corroborates its crucial implication in disease aetiology rather than being merely a secondary effect
due to neuronal loss (Lau et al., 2013). To further explore the cellular origin of the observed

RI
PT

downregulation, we separated white and grey matter sections and detected a considerable stronger
downregulation of both miRNAs in grey matter of AD samples (female), which supports the primarily
neuronal origin of the observed miR-132/212 dysregulation. In contrast to our results, Wang et al

SC

(Wang et al., 2011) reported a downregulation of miR-212 in white matter rather than grey matter
regions. This discrepancy might derive from the rather small sample size (N=10) of their study in
combination with the applied gender stratification. Corresponding to our study, Lau et al (Lau et al.,

M
AN
U

2013) observed a clear decrease of miR-132 expression especially in tangle bearing cortical neurons
of AD patients. In addition, further studies showed that the loss of miR-132 affects the processing of
MAPT and leads to aberrant splicing of MAPT exon 10 in frontotemporal dementia and progressive
supranuclear palsy mediated by PTBP2 (Hébert et al., 2012; Lau et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2011).
Furthermore, miR-132 has been linked to several pathways playing a major role in the pathogenesis of

TE
D

AD, such as inflammatory processes (Soreq and Wolf, 2011), synaptic function, -structure and plasticity (Bicker et al., 2014; Edbauer et al., 2010; Remenyi et al., 2013), and cholinergic signaling by
targeting AChE (Lu et al., 2013; Shaked et al., 2009; Shaltiel et al., 2013). Both miRNAs (miR-132 and

EP

miR-212) are also involved in neuronal migration, axonal growth and neuronal morphology (Hancock
et al., 2014; Magill et al., 2010) and decreased expression of miR-132 is associated with the induction

AC
C

of apoptosis via de-repression of FOXO3a (Wong et al., 2013).
So far, only few validated target genes of miR-132 and miR-212 have been described (Lau et al.,
2014; Wanet et al., 2012). Interestingly, several of these known targets, such as SIRT1, FOXO1, and
p250GAP also showed a deregulation in our mRNA expression analysis in AD (Table S2). So far, just
one group performed simultaneous miRNA and mRNA expression analyses using a limited number of
eight AD and control brains, each (Nunez-Iglesias et al., 2010). In this study, we present joint genome
wide miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in temporal cortex of a much larger sample set (64
samples). Interestingly, among the strongest deregulated mRNAs identified in this study, were a
considerable number of genes that have previously been associated with AD. For example, we
identified a strong upregulation of three small nuclear RNAs, RNU1-3, RNU1-5 and RNU1G2 that are

12

Pichler et al

part of the cellular spliceosome complex. These small nuclear RNAs have recently been described to
form tangle-like structures, aggregate with NFTs and to severely affect splicing processes in AD (Bai
et al., 2013; Hales et al., 2014). Moreover, GFAP and NFkB1, two well-known markers of inflammation
in AD, were strongly upregulated in brains of AD patients (Ascolani et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2005;
Ingelsson et al., 2004; Nagele et al., 2004).

RI
PT

We also explored possible miR-132/212 binding sites at 3’UTRs of those mRNAs showing the
strongest expression alterations and identified potential binding sites at four of ten genome wide
significant deregulated mRNAs. The results from the miRWalk prediction tool were further supported

SC

by energetically most reasonable miRNA-RNA structures. The binding site prediction and strong
associations with the glial derived inflammatory genes, GFAP and NFkB1 (Ingelsson et al., 2004; Lian
et al., 2014) is somewhat surprising as our results indicate a primarily neuronal origin of the miR-

M
AN
U

132/212 decrease. However the fact that downregulation of miR-132/212 also occurred in white-matter
fractions with a larger content of glial cells and the usage of whole-brain material for gene expression
analyses may explain these findings.

Concerning the other target genes PKN2 and C5ORF41, both are expressed in neurons. Functionally
PKN2, a protein kinase, was found to promote neurite growth in hippocampal neurons (Buchser et al.,

TE
D

2010) and C5ORF41 to degrade CREB3, which is implicated in numerous functions such as unfolded
protein response during ER stress, viral infections and immunity (Audas et al., 2008; Yang et al.,
2013). Interestingly, transcription of the miR-132/212 locus is regulated by CREB another member of

EP

the CREB family (Wanet et al., 2012). Likewise to AD loss of CREB as well as miR-132/212 cause a
decrease of dendritic growth, branching of neurons and disturbances of memory formation

AC
C

(Hernandez-Rapp et al., 2015; Magill et al., 2010).
Since many of the target genes mentioned above are associated with cellular or clinical alterations
typically occurring in AD, it may be hypothesized that following-up these in silico results may provide
us with a better understanding of biological mechanisms leading to AD.
In conclusion, our study adds substantial evidence to an early and major involvement of hsa-miR-1323p and hsa-miR-212-3p in the pathogenesis of AD and further supports the primarily neuronal origin of
these miRNAs. In addition, we provide for the first time a large data set of genome wide miRNA and
mRNA expression profiles from AD and control brains highlighting some new potential miR-132/212
target genes. Further functional work, however is mandatory to fully understand the cellular and
