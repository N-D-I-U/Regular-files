MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 19–25 nt long non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally by binding with partially complementary sequences in the 30 -untranslated region (30 UTR) and inhibiting mRNA translation or by affecting mRNA stability. We have characterized the structures and the equilibrium between hairpin and homo-duplex form of the mature strand of hsa-mir-520h
by various concentration and temperature dependent 1D, 2D NMR experiments and those structures correspond well with Mfold-folded and UNAFold-aligned secondary structures. A detailed folding and alignment analysis in physiological conditions of all mature miRNA strands from the complete database of
known miRNAs (miRBase) was performed. The statistical analysis of the resulting folding and alignment
data showed for the ﬁrst time the potential of a large number of mature miRNAs to form signiﬁcant hairpin and/or homo-duplex structures in solution. The self-complementarity of mature miRNAs can provide
a mechanistic tuning and a regulatory sophistication to the process of miRNA mediated gene regulation.

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, short (19–25 nt) single
stranded, non-coding RNAs found in numerous eukaryotic lineages, including plants, insects, vertebrates, and mammals [1–3].
They are evolutionary conserved [4] and they function as regulator
of post-transcriptional gene expression [5]. In this way, they control diverse biological processes in cells such as developmental
timing [6], differentiation [7], cell proliferation [8], haematopoiesis
[9] and apoptosis. There is a growing number of reports that link
miRNAs to the regulation of pathways associated with diseases
such as cancer [10,11], neurological diseases [12] and most recently also with viral [13] and metabolic [14] disease.
Based on previous work, it is known that primary miRNAs (primiRNAs) are derived from the transcription of large, highly structured precursors encoded by cellular genes. Then Drosha cleaves
pri-miRNAs into 70–100 nt miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs)
[15,16], which are transported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm
by Exportin 5 [17,18]. Subsequently, Dicer processes these premiRNAs into siRNA-like miRNA–miRNA* duplexes [19,20]. These
duplexes [21] unwind in the cytoplasm, after which the mature
guide strands [22] are speciﬁcally loaded into microRNP complexes
and the passenger strands are degraded [3]. Mature miRNAs reside
in the microRNP, likely similar to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [23–25], which regulates mRNA by sequence speciﬁc
base pairing with miRNA-complementary sequences in mRNA tar* Corresponding author. Fax: +32 16 337340.

get [26,27]. It is observed that depending on the level of complementarity between miRNA and the target sequences, the mRNA
can either be translationally repressed (if there is only partial
alignment) or cleaved in case of full complementarity. Generally
in animals translational repression [23,28] seems to be the key
method while in plants mRNA degradation [29] is the most likely
pathway, however, recently some exceptions have been reported
[30].
MicroRNAs are believed to control the expression of thousands
of target mRNAs [31,32] and mRNAs are believed to be targeted by
multiple miRNA [27]. In order to fully understand the biological
functions of miRNAs, it requires knowledge of their mRNA targets.
Many bioinformatics approaches have been used to predict mRNA
targets [33], and to govern the principle of miRNA target binding
[31]. Recently three in silico studies predicted the interaction of
miRNA with other miRNA [34], and with genomic repetitive elements like Alu RNA [35–38] and suggested a regulatory role of
those interactions on miRNA functions.
When we tried to experimentally characterize such an interaction of hsa-miR-520h mature strand with Alu Jo-RNA by different
solution phase biophysical and biochemical measurements, we
were unsuccessful to diagnose such interactions. Contrarily, we observed that at higher oligo concentrations, the miRNA which was
predicted to interact with Alu-RNA sequences, self-aggregated.
This process, which occurs in solution, possibly prevented the mutual interaction between miRNA and Alu target. To study this phenomenon in detail, we studied the conformational feature of the
mature strand of hsa-miR-520h by various NMR biophysical experiments, we observed that at low temperature and low concentra-

tion a less stable hairpin structure is formed which, at higher oligo
concentration, forms a stable homo-duplex by breaking the hairpin
form. The folded hairpin (Mfold) and aligned homo-duplex (UNAFold) structures for this sequence correspond well with the NMR
observations. A detailed folding and alignment analysis for all the
mature miRNA strands from miRBase (database of miRNAs) was
performed in physiological conditions. The statistical data analysis
of the resulting folding and alignments showed the tendency of a
large number of mature miRNAs to form signiﬁcant self-complementary hairpin and/or homo-duplex structures in solution.
Materials and methods
NMR samples. RP-HPLC puriﬁed 22 nt miRNA (mature strand of
hsa-miR-520h) oligo was purchased from Eurogentec S.A., Belgium
and used as such to prepare NMR sample solution. Samples were
annealed prior to NMR experiments by brieﬂy heating at 70 °C
and snap cooling on ice to promote hairpin formation. Samples
were lyophilized and re-dissolved in 100% D2O or in a 90%/10%
mixture of H2O/D2O. The pH was adjusted to 6.5 by adding few
ll of NaOH solution (0.1 N) in D2O.
NMR experiments. Proton NMR spectra were recorded in
H2O:D2O (9:1) using different concentrations of miRNA and various experimental temperatures in Bruker Avance II 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm TXI HCN Z gradient cryoprobe
(BioMacs). The water signal was suppressed by excitation sculpting
with gradient pulse (Puls Program: zgesgp). A 2D NOESY spectrum
was recorded in H2O:D2O (9:1) at 10 °C using WATERGATE watersuppression with a sweep width of 13,200 Hz in both dimensions,
128 scans, 4 K data points in t2 and 512 FIDs in t1 dimension. The
data were apodized with a shifted sine-bell square function in both
dimensions. Proton spectra in D2O were also measured (with water
pre-saturation) at different temperatures (5–70 °C) in a Bruker
Avance II 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with 5 mm TXI HCP Z
gradient probe to study non-exchangeable protons.
Folding and alignment analysis. Sequences of all miRNA mature
strands were obtained from the mirBase [39] (Release 11.0) – comprehensive miRNA database (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/). The sequences were classiﬁed into groups as Virus,
Mouse, Human, Animal and Plant. Only unique mature miRNA sequences were considered in each category and the repetition of
same sequences from different species within a group was deleted.
Mfold [40] program version 3.2 (http://mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/) was
used to compute the folding free energies at 37 °C temperature and
1 M sodium ion concentration for all the sequences towards formation of hairpin structures. The free energies and estimated melting
temperatures for all mature miRNA sequences to form homo-duplex structures were computed by UNAFold [41] program (Version
3.5) at 37 °C temperature, 1 M sodium ion concentration, 5 lM
RNA strand concentration. The folding free energies for hairpins
and the melting temperatures for homo-duplexes were used to arrange the sequences in each category to ﬁnd out most probable and
least probable sequences towards their ability to form self-complimentary structures. Histograms were created with the analyzed
data for each group in order to get an idea about the distribution
of different miRNA sequences towards the formation of self-complementary hairpin and homo-duplex structure.

Concentration dependency of self-aggregation
The concentration dependency (Fig. S1) of the hydrogen bonded
imino proton signals of the homo-duplex further gives evidence in
favor of self-aggregation as inter-strand process. At 20 °C it was
found that the self-aggregation occurred on or above 0.3 mM oligo
concentration, as indicated by the appearance and the gradual increase in the imino peak intensity at chemical shifts (d) 13.9, 13.4,
11.9 and 10.9. When the concentration was 0.88 mM or more, signals from additional hydrogen bonded imino protons appeared at d

probably caused by the formation of higher ordered aggregates of
the homo-duplex form by sticking of large single stranded ends. At
concentration of 0.1 mM or less, there is no signiﬁcant structure

the breaking of higher ordered aggregates occurs ﬁrst followed by
melting of the duplex structure. Initial increase of temperature up
to 25 °C increases the intensity and sharpness of the imino signals
because of slower relaxation associated with the formation of lower effective molecular weight duplex species. Then further heating
above 30 °C gradually melts the duplex form as indicated by broad
imino signals and the subsequent disappearance of the imino
peaks.
NMR identiﬁcation of hairpin form and its thermal stability
The 0.1 mM oligo sample at 20 °C did not show any imino
peaks. However, when the sample was cooled to 5 °C and measured with higher number of scan, a distinct hydrogen bonded imino proton proﬁle appeared (Fig. S3) for the hairpin structure which
has no GU base paired imino proton signals and which were different from the imino proton signals of the homo-duplex form
(1.7 mM, 5 °C). At relatively low (0.1 mM) oligo concentration the
temperature dependency (Fig. S4) of imino proton signals is rather
simple and only the melting of hairpin form around 15–20 °C is
observed.
NMR biophysical experiments thus conﬁrm the structures
(Fig. 1) of the mature hsa-mir-520h strand, which were predicted
by Mfold and UNAFold. However, the signals of aromatic and sugar
protons (proton spectra in D2O solvent) of miRNA were temperature dependent (Fig. S5). It was observed that, as we increased
the sample temperature, the lines became more resolved, sharp
and around 50 °C only the single stranded form is predominantly
present. At low temperatures and high oligo concentrations, due
to the formation of higher ordered aggregates which are having
relatively lower relaxation time, due to the existence of single
stranded and double stranded regions in the structures, the NMR
spectra have severely overlapped and broad signals that are weak
in intensity. The same sequence of mature strand is on interplay
between hairpin and homo-duplex forms. The hairpin form exists
at low oligo concentration, where NMR sensitivity is signiﬁcantly
low and no further detailed assignment and structural investigation was possible for either the hairpin or the homo-duplex
structure.
Folding and alignment analysis showed many miRNA mature strands
are self-complementary
Mfold and UNAFold calculations for self-complementarity of all
the mature miRNA sequences and subsequent statistical analysis
result in the following main observations. (a) The percentages of
mature miRNAs to fold into hairpin structures, which are having
a negative folding free energies, are in the case of Virus 78.34%,
Mouse 74.02%, Human 73.36%, Animal 70.49%, Plant 68.69%. (b)
Similarly, the percentages of mature miRNAs to form self-aggregated homo-duplex structure, which are having melting temperature above 37 °C, are for Virus 66.24%, Mouse 59.18%, Human
57.29%, Animal 55.25%, Plant 52.32%. (c) In each category, typical
distribution plots (Figs. 3 and S6–S12) were obtained when the
number of mature miRNAs were plotted with folding free energies
and melting temperature of the homo-duplexes. (d) The most
probable change in free energy (DG) value and melting temperature (Tm) of the folding and alignment distributions of all the categories of mature miRNAs are respectively within 0.8 to 1.6 kcal/
mol and around 40 °C temperature. (e) It is also observed that 50%
of mature miRNAs are moderately low to very low selfcomplementary.
The structures generated by the programs showed that many
sequences are highly self-complementary and potentially adopt
hairpin and/or homo-duplex structures in solution at near physiological conditions. In many of the cases, the mature miRNA se-

quences which fold in hairpin forms at low oligo concentrations,
form homo-duplexes at higher oligo concentrations. All the
homo-duplexes are symmetric and can have some GU wobble base
pairs. The homo-duplexes, in many cases, have a central internal
loop or two internal loops at the two opposite ends of the duplex,
and in some cases, are almost full or partly complementary without having internal loops. In some of the hairpin structures, bulged
nucleobases or mismatched bases appear in the stem, while in
majority of the hairpins, stems are highly complementary without
bulges or mismatches. The best self-complementary homo-duplex
and hairpin of the miRNA categories are depicted in Figs. 4 and S13,
respectively. Some additional representative self-complementary
mature human miRNA homo-duplexes and their corresponding
hairpin forms are presented in the supporting information
(Fig. S14).
Discussion
The mature miRNAs are generally being considered as single
stranded, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no report demonstrating self-complementarity in mature miRNAs. With NMR
biophysical studies we have characterized the self-complementary

M. Maiti et al. / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 392 (2010) 572–576

secondary structures of the hsa-miR-520h mature strand, and with
Folding-alignment analysis we have shown that the self-complementary sequence in more than 50% of mature miRNAs drives
the formation of hairpin and/or homo-duplex structures in
solution.
Most of miRNA–mRNA interactions downregulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, even though there are some recent
exceptional reports where miRNAs showed upregulation [42,43]
of gene expression. A substantial variation in the degree of gene
regulation (from less than 2-fold to greater than 10-fold) has been
observed, depending on the speciﬁc miRNA–mRNA target combination. The determinants that deﬁne the different magnitudes of
regulation remain to be deﬁned. Whether the degree of translation
of such mRNAs is determined by the accessibility of mRNA target
sites to miRNAs or by other factors like involvement of various proteins that speciﬁcally bind with UTR regions and thus alter the
mRNA structure to modulate the interaction between miRNA and
mRNA, is unknown. Recently a study [44] showed the role of messenger RNA structure in microRNA target recognition and suggested that binding of the RNA-induced silencing complex is
largely controlled by the thermodynamics of RNA–RNA interactions [45,46].
Our ﬁnding of mature miRNA secondary structures and the differential extent of self-complementarity can have a conformational
role to modulate miRNA–mRNA interactions and thus can explain
the different degree of genetic regulation for the speciﬁc miRNA involved in the regulation process. This can contribute to the mechanism by which nature selected sequences for some miRNAs to
modulate its binding afﬁnity with their mRNA targets. The selfaggregation in certain numbers of miRNAs can be a way by which
miRNA:miRNA* duplexes unwind easily and thus facilitate the
loading of the mature miRNA strand in miRNA RISC. It can also provide speciﬁcity for the interaction of miRNAs with particular mRNA
by preventing the possibility of binding of other miRNAs and complementary genomic RNAs with miRNAs. The high tendency for
self-aggregation may also be a defense system for foreign miRNAs,
and may suggest that there are no free miRNAs in a cell.
Generally, it is observed that in some mature miRNA self-complementary hairpin and/or homo-duplex structures, the mRNA
complimentary 50 -seed (7 nt) sequences are freely available for
miRNA–mRNA interaction, while in others complimentary 50 -seeds
are inaccessible as they are involved in the hydrogen bonding of
hairpin and/or homo-duplex stem. It deserves more detailed further investigation to ﬁnd out how the self-complementarity of mature miRNA affects the mutual interaction of miRNA with mRNA
targets and other RNAs, which can target mature miRNAs.
