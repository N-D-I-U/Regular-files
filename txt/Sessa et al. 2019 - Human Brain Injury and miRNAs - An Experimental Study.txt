Abstract: Brain damage is a complex dysfunction that involves a variety of conditions whose
pathogenesis involves a number of mediators that lead to clinical sequelae. For this reason, the
identification of specific circulating and/or tissue biomarkers which could indicate brain injury is
challenging. This experimental study focused on microRNAs (miRNAs), a well-known diagnostic
tool both in the clinical setting and in medico-legal investigation. Previous studies demonstrated that
specific miRNAs (miR-21, miR-34, miR-124, miR-132, and miR-200b) control important target genes
involved in neuronal apoptosis and neuronal stress-induced adaptation. Thus, in this experimental
setting, their expression was evaluated in three selected groups of cadavers: drug abusers (cocaine),
ischemic-stroke-related deaths, and aging damage in elder people who died from other neurological
causes. The results demonstrated that the drug abuser group showed a higher expression of miR-132
and miR-34, suggesting a specific pathway in consumption-induced neurodegeneration. Instead,
miR-200b and miR-21 dysregulation was linked to age-related cognitive impairment, and finally,
stroke events and consequences were associated with an alteration in miR-200b, miR-21, and miR-124;
significantly higher levels of this last expression are strongly sensitive for ischemic damage. Moreover,
these results suggest that these expression patterns could be studied in other biological samples
(plasma, urine) in subjects with brain injury linked to aging, drug abuse, and stroke to identify reliable
biomarkers that could be applied in clinical practice. Further studies with larger samples are needed
to confirm these interesting findings.

1. Introduction
Brain damage and/or dysfunction as sequelae of different conditions are considered an important
field of research for the scientific community. Recent studies have focused on the side effects related to
aging on the central nervous system (CNS). Moreover, a growing number of investigations have been
conducted, analyzing the effects of stroke and drug use/abuse.
It is well known that in developed countries this kind of problem occurs in a large number of
people and is becoming a social and economic problem. The number of older people is constantly

increasing, generating a high cost for public health [1]. However, a sedentary lifestyle combined with
other factors such as diet and genetic factors can represent the main risk factors for brain stroke [2].
Finally, in the last few years the greater availability and variability of drugs combined with a modern
lifestyle have generated a large number of addicts [3–5].
Since 2007 the development of microRNA (miRNA) technologies has become an essential part
of research projects [6–8]. The scientific community has frequently investigated these technologies,
considering them as potential molecular biomarkers for several diseases. Today, miRNA dosage
has become an essential tool in several clinical applications, such as viral infection diagnosis [9],
cancer characterization and prediction of the course of a disease [10–12], cardiovascular disorder
diagnosis [13–16], identification of specific patterns in primary muscular disorders [17], and identification
of differences between diagnosed type 1 diabetes and healthy controls [18]. Moreover, these biomarkers
are becoming very important in brain injury research.
The databases Medline, Cochrane Central, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, EMBASE,
and Google Scholar were searched from 2007 to June 2017, using the following keywords: “Brain
Injury”, “miRNA dysregulation”, “Stroke”, “Aging”, “Drug Abuser”. The main keywords, “Brain
Injury” and “miRNA”, were searched for in association with each of the others.
At the end of the literature review, several miRNAs were selected as potential biomarkers
for different brain injuries. Particularly, miRNA hsa-miR-132-3p, hsa-miR-200b-3p, hsa-miR-21-5p,
hsa-miR-34a-5p, and hsa-miR-124-5p have been linked with neuronal death, neurogenesis,
angiogenesis, platelet aggregation, leukocyte infiltration, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption,
and tissue infarction [19,20].
This study aimed to identify specific biomarkers (miRNAs) that could be useful in forensic
investigations to identify the exact cause of brain injury among several diseases. Particularly, the goal
of this experimental study was the identification of specific miRNAs for different kinds of brain
damage such as brain stroke, drug use, and aging.
To achieve this goal, the expression levels of five miRNAs (miRNA hsa-miR-132-3p, hsa-miR-200b-3p,
hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-124-5p) were chosen after a systematic literature review and
evaluated in the brain tissues of 15 selected cases, subdivided into three groups:
-

stroke group (SG): 5 men who died from brain stroke;
drug group (DG): 5 men who died from drug abuse (cocaine);
aged group (AG): 5 older men who died from Sudden Cardiac arrest.

The expression levels of these five miRNAs were statistically analyzed to evaluate intergroup variations.

3. Discussion
Brain damage is a complex dysfunction that involves a variety of conditions whose pathogenesis
includes a number of mediators that lead to clinical sequelae. For this reason, the identification of
specific circulating and/or tissue biomarkers which could indicate brain injury is challenging [21–23].
Moreover, this is true whether diagnosing early in order to benefit patients by starting appropriate
treatment early or whether investigating the cause of death, except for cases in which the circumstances
of the event are strongly evocative.
In this context, miRNAs can play an important role in modulating a variety of brain conditions
and can serve as new biomarkers. The miRNAs selected in this study (miR-21, miR-34, miR-124,
miR-132, and miR-200b), have been predicted to control important target genes involved in neuronal
apoptosis and neuronal stress-induced adaptation.
In detail, as well as being a strong indicator of widespread axonal damage [24], miR-21 could
be a diagnostic biomarker of cerebral ischemia [25]. The miR-21 pathway of expression seems
to be related to the activity of Akt signaling by suppression of phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN)-gene expression, resulting in further suppression of caspase-3 expression [26]. This cascade
prevents apoptosis of cortical neurons. In addition, patients with stroke and atherosclerosis show
significantly higher plasmatic levels of miR-21, which has been interpreted as a strong anti-apoptotic
prevention measure [27]. Furthermore, the study conducted by Buller et al., employing in situ
hybridization, demonstrated that miR-21 expression was upregulated in neurons in the area adjacent
to the ischemic area as an expression of protection from ischemic neuronal death [28]. Finally, miR-21
acts as an anti-inflammatory marker during ischemic stroke [29]. This evidence is in line with our
results with miR-21 expression levels being significantly higher in the SG and AG groups compared to
the control trauma group and the DG group.
Similar considerations can be made about miR-124. In fact, Jeyaseelan et al. demonstrated that
miR-124 was increased in a murine model following cerebral artery occlusion and 24 h reperfusion [30].
Moreover, miR-124 is significantly increased, as well as miR-21, in the area surrounding an ischemic
zone. In the same animal model, the nervous overexpression of miR-124 correlated with a decreased
infarct size [19]. The probable explanation would result in the anti-apoptotic genes targeted by
miR-124 being Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL [31]. According to this data, miR-124 expression, presented in Section 2,
showed significant differences, resulting in higher expression in the SG group with respect to the other
two groups. A further target of miR-124 is the REST (RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor) gene that
determines a reduction of the expression of neuronal plasticity genes (synaptophysin, BDNF, Brain
Derived Neurotrophic Factor). Cocaine induces REST and suppresses miR-124, influencing tolerance,
sensitization, and addiction [32]. In our experimental setting, the expression values of this miRNA
were significantly higher in the DG group with respect to the AG group. Moreover, this neuroprotective
function of miR-124 could also be extended to other neurodegenerative diseases. In fact, the miR-124
level in the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s disease is down-regulated, in parallel to the increase in
expression of beta-site expression APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) [33]. In addition to this mechanism
of neurodegeneration, miR-124 is involved in long-term plasticity affecting the transcription factor
CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) [34]. Our experimental findings showed that miR-124
expression in the AG group was similar to that in the control group, showing the lowest statistical
significance in inter-group variation. The expression was statistically higher in the SG group, leading
us to hypothesize its role as a diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of ischemic stroke. However, cognitive
decline can be attributed to complex interactions involving cellular dysfunction, cumulative over time,
and life habits that cause the reduction of plasticity in the elderly. The overexpression of miR-34 was
related to an increased rate of apoptosis associated with a decrease in Bcl-2 expression in mouse models
and in human cell lines [35]. In contrast, an induced down-regulation of miR-34 blocked the inhibition
of the expression of the target gene, Bcl-2. In addition, the high levels of the post-transcriptional
protein that were induced were accompanied by concomitant low levels of Bax expression and low
cleavage by caspases. This mechanism was also observed in the brains of mice with a low-calorie

diet. Furthermore, in an experimental study on the hippocampus of rats, in order to evaluate the
evolution of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, miR-34 levels were found to be
elevated [36]. Therefore, in our analysis, the expression values of miR-34 were higher in all three groups
compared to the control group, probably interpretable as an important index of neurodegeneration
being statistically significant in the DG group.
In the SG group, an important role was played by miR-132, whose function is to regulate the
glutamate receptor expression level as well as post-stroke excitotoxicity [37]. In fact, some recent
studies have shown that the use of miR-132 antagomir during cerebral ischemic attacks may have
neuroprotective effects through the suppression of glutamate receptor expression, acting on CREB
as stated for miR-124 [38,39]. Moreover, higher serum miR-132 levels were recently suggested
as biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment, a stage often preceding Alzheimer’s disease [40].
Considering this effect on memorization processes, recent studies have proved that miR-132 is induced
in culture by neurotrophins and neuronal activity and is able to modulate dendritic morphology via the
suppression of p250 GTPase-activating protein (p250GAP) [41,42]. Acting between the neural and
immune system, miR-132 has recently been discovered to reduce brain inflammation and to increase
the level of acetylcholine [43–45]. In our experimental setting, the expression levels of miR-132 were
higher in all three groups. Therefore, the DG group presented significantly higher levels than the SG
and AG groups.
The reason for this could be found in some studies demonstrating the upregulation of mature
miR-132 expression in rats following cocaine self-administration (SA). Furthermore, recent observations
from Hollander et al. confirmed that 6 h (but not 1 h) access to cocaine SA for 7 days increased miR-132
expression in the rat striatum [46]. The significant increase in miR-132 levels was long lasting and
remained high in rats that had been withdrawn from cocaine SA. Changes in dopamine and glutamate
neurotransmission, alterations in specific signaling pathways, and/or epigenetic regulation have been
advocated as a possible explanation. As chronic cocaine exposure alters dopamine and glutamate
signaling by stimulating the dopamine D1 and glutamate NMDA receptors, these targets trigger
the activation of the corresponding downstream signaling pathways and lead to CREB-dependent
gene expression [47].
Another miRNA expressed in brain tissue, particularly in microglia, and involved in inflammatory
response is miR-200b. Oligodendrocytes (OL) are myelin-forming cells of the central nervous system
that are vulnerable to cerebral ischemia. The loss of OL and myelin impairs axonal function and is
detrimental to functional recovery. Another study by Buller et al. proved that ischemic stroke causes
an up-regulation of Serum response factor (SRF) and a down-regulation of miR-200b in OL white
matter [48], indicating that miR-200b plays an important role in stroke-induced SRF up-regulation,
which ultimately affects OL progenitor cell differentiation. Analogously, microglia treated with
miR-200b-inhibitor cause neuronal apoptosis in cell culture that is due to an excessive release of
inflammatory cytokines and NO in the conditioned medium via increased cJun activity [49]. In addition,
impaired microglial migration has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of several brain
diseases such as Prion disease [50], Parkinson’s disease [51], and Alzheimer’s disease [52], and it
inhibits axonal regeneration during acute CNS injury [53]. However, further experiments are required
to ascertain the possible neuroprotective role of microglial miR-200b. These literature data are in
line with the statistical results of our experimental setting: the expression levels of miRNA-21 and
miRNA-200b were higher in the SG and AG groups compared to the control group, while in the DG
group, the expression was similar to that in the control group.
4. Material and Methods

from brain stroke were selected (mean age 57.8 ± 6.7 years) and made up the SG group; five cases
of men who died with a toxicological test positive for drug abuse (cocaine) were selected (mean age
29.2 ± 5.6 years) and made up the DG group; and five cases of older men who died from Sudden
Cardiac arrest (mean age 75.8 ± 6.9 years) made up the AG group.
Finally, two cases of previously healthy men (mean age 41 ± 1.5 years) who died in car accidents
from causes other than brain trauma were selected as controls in the Real-Time PCR reactions.
All procedures were performed in accordance with international guidelines and were approved

4.2. miRNA Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA, including miRNAs, was isolated from formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
samples (four 20 µm sections) using the Recover All Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Applied
Biosystems Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) with minor modifications. Briefly, before
RNA extraction, all samples were deparaffinated and processed as indicated in the protocol. Finally,
the purified RNA was eluted with 65 µL RNAse-free water. Quantification was performed in heart
and musculoskeletal tissues.
The quantification of RNA was performed with the Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Applied Biosystems
Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) using the Qubit Fluorometer; it provides an accurate and
selective method for the quantitation of low-abundance RNA samples.
For miRNA profiling, the TaqMan Advanced miRNA Assay (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt,
Germany) was used. This kit is composed of pre-formulated primer and probe sets that are designed for the
analysis of miRNA expression levels. The assays were selected at thermofisher.com/advancedmirna.
The miRNAs tested in the selected samples are summarized in Table 3:

cDNA was obtained following the TaqMan Advanced miRNA Assays User Guide (Applied
Biosystems, Publication number 100027897 Rev. C). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was
performed using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems Darmstadt, Germany),
and raw data were analyzed using the accompanying software (version 2.3). As described in the user’s
guide for the Fast reaction plate, the qRT-PCR reactions (in triplicate) were performed with incubation
at 95 ◦ C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 ◦ C for 1 s and 60 ◦ C for 20 s. A negative control without
cDNA was also included in parallel.
The data obtained were compared with the data from endogenous controls; as described in the
user guide, they showed that gene expression was relatively constant across tissues. Normalization
to endogenous control genes is currently the most accurate method to correct for potential biases
that are caused by sample collection, variation in the amount of starting material, RT efficiency, and
RNA preparation and quality. For this experiment, “has-miR-186-5p” (TaqMan Advanced miRNA
Assays, Applied Biosystems Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) was used as an endogenous
control (Table 2).
Expression fold changes were computed using the 2−∆∆Ct calculation [54], where ∆Ct = Ct(test miRNA)
− Ct(mir-186-5p) and ∆∆Ct = ∆Ct(individual sample) − ∆Ct(control median samples, Table 2).
4.3. Statistics
Unless specified otherwise, data are expressed as means ± SEM versus baseline. Statistical
comparisons were performed using one-way ANOVA (Microsoft Office Excel 2007) and post hoc
pair wise comparisons were performed using Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (the TukeyHSD
function in R). A value of p < 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference. Descriptive and
statistical comparisons was performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2007.

5. Conclusions
Although brain injury results from complex pathophysiological interactions, miRNAs are
considered reliable biomarkers. In our experimental setting, drug (cocaine) consumption was found to
be related to higher expression of miR-132 and miR-34, suggesting a specific pathway in its induced
neurodegeneration. Instead, miR200b and miR-21 dysregulation should be linked to age-related
cognitive impairment. Finally, stroke events and consequences could be associated with alterations
in miR-200b, miR-21, and miR-124, with significantly higher levels of miR-124 expression being very
sensitive for ischemic damage.
Studies with larger samples are mandatory to confirm our interesting findings with the aim of
using these molecules as biomarkers in forensic investigation: the higher expression of miR-132 and
miR-34 may be used as a marker for brain injury from drug (cocaine) consumption; the expression
pattern of higher levels of miR-200b and miR-21 and the threshold value of mir-124 expression could
indicate cases of age-related cognitive impairment; and the expression pattern of higher levels of
miR-200b, miR-21, and miR-124 is indicative of ischemic brain injury. These expression patterns could
be very useful as easily available tissue biomarkers in medico-legal investigations to ascertain the exact
cause of death in suspected brain injury cases.
On the other hand, our results suggest that these expression patterns could be studied in other
biological samples (such as plasma and urine) in living subjects with brain injury linked to aging, drug
abuse, and stroke. The identification of new molecular biomarkers could be very useful in clinical
practice to quickly orient diagnosis and determine the most suitable treatment in the shortest time.
Further studies should be carried out with this specific purpose.
