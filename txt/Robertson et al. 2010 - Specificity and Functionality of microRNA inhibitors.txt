Abstract
Background: Micro(mi)RNAs regulate gene expression through translational attenuation and messenger (m)RNA
degradation, and are associated with differentiation, homeostasis and disease. Natural miRNA target recognition is
determined primarily by perfect complementarity in a seed region (nucleotide positions 2 to 7) with additional
interactions contributing in a sequence- and target-specific manner. Synthetic miRNA target analogs, which are fully
complementary, chemically modified oligonucleotides, have been used successfully to inhibit miRNA function.
Results: In this paper, we present a first systematic study to evaluate the effect of mismatches in the target site on
synthetic inhibitor activity. Panels of miRNA inhibitors containing two-nucleotide mismatches across the target site
were tested against three miRNAs (miR-21, miR-22 and miR-122). The results showed that the function of inhibitors vary
as mismatch positions in the inhibitors change.
Conclusions: The data indicate that features important for natural miRNA target recognition (such as seed region
complementarity) are also important for inhibitor functionality. In addition, base pairing at a second, more 3' region
appears to be equally important in determining the efficacy of synthetic inhibitors. Considering the importance of
these inhibitor regions and the expression of closely related miRNA sequences will enable researchers to interpret
results more accurately in future experiments.
Background
Micro (mi)RNAs are small (17 to 27 nucleotides), noncoding RNAs that act in association with Argonaute
(Ago) proteins to modulate gene expression via an effector nucleic acid-protein complex (microribonucleoprotein (RNP) or miRNA-induced silencing complex
(RISC)). In animals, miRNA-based gene modulation
occurs predominantly by the mature miRNA binding to
an mRNA target site through partial base pairing, resulting in translational attenuation (for recent reviews, see
[1-6]). Computational and experimental techniques for
identifying target sites [7-10] have found that complementarity to the seed region (nucleotide positions 2 to 7
or 2 to 8 of the mature miRNA) is often an important
determinant of target sites. In some cases of incomplete
seed-pairing, pairing at '3'-compensatory' sites of the
mature miRNA creates a functional target site [11,12].
The large number of potential target sites per miRNA,
combined with the hundreds of putative miRNAs, has led

to the prediction that a large fraction of human genes
could be modulated by miRNAs.
The functional roles of miRNAs can be investigated
using inhibitors, which are nucleic acid-based molecules
that suppress miRNA function. Synthetic miRNA inhibitor designs incorporate the reverse complement of the
mature miRNA (the target site) and are chemically modified to prevent RISC-induced cleavage, enhance binding
affinity and provide resistance to nucleolytic degradation
(for review see [13]). When delivered to a cell, binding of
endogenous mature miRNAs to these complementary
synthetic target sites is thought to be irreversible, thus
these inhibitors are presumed to sequester the endogenous miRNA, making it unavailable for normal function
[14-19].
To correctly associate outcomes of inhibitor experiments with specific miRNAs, it is important to understand the degree to which an inhibitor designed against
one miRNA affects other miRNAs. We used synthetic
inhibitors and luciferase reporters targeted by individual
miRNAs to study inhibitor specificity among both natural
miRNA variants in a multi-member family (let-7) and
artificially designed inhibitor variants to single miRNAs
(miR-21, -22, -122). Strong inhibitor crossreactivity

between members of the human let-7 family, which share
extensive sequence identity, was observed. Inhibitors to
three different human miRNAs (miR-21, miR-22 and
miR-122) were systematically mismatched at all positions, and two regions that affect inhibitor specificity
were identified: the seed region (positions 3 to 8) and an
additional 3' region (positions 13 to 18). These results will
aid in interpretation of synthetic miRNA inhibitor studies
and improvement of experimental design.

reporters crossreact with these miRNAs. The data also
suggest that reporters (expressed mRNAs) and inhibitors
(synthetic modified oligonucleotides) have different criteria for crossreactivity with endogenous miRNAs.
Although it is possible to specifically detect expression of
mature miRNAs [21-24], quantifying the level of functionally active mature miRNA (to measure inhibitor function) for closely related sequences is technically
challenging. Owing to the difficulties inherent in working
with multiple, related, endogenously expressed miRNAs,
we decided to develop an assay in a less complex system.

Inhibitors of let-7 family members exhibit crossreactivity

To gain insight into the level of inhibitor crossreactivity
to be expected between closely related family members,
hairpin inhibitors (see Methods) designed against each of
the nine human let-7 miRNAs (Figure 1a) were chosen
for study. Some human let-7 miRNAs are expressed in
many common immortal cell lines. The nine family members have sequences that differ from the canonical let-7a
at either single or multiple nucleotide positions (Figure
1a). The assay system used was a set of dual-luciferase
reporters for each of the let-7 miRNAs, as this type of
reporter has demonstrated sufficient sensitivity to distinguish between inhibitors with only slight differences in
functionality [20]. The target sites in these reporters are
perfectly complementary to the mature miRNAs, because
mismatched/attenuation type target sites were found to
be much less sensitive [20]. All possible inhibitor/
reporter pairs were tested by co-transfection into HeLa
cells. The results clearly demonstrated that human let-7
miRNA inhibitors and reporter constructs, either alone
or in combination, are non-specific (Figure 1b-d; also see
Additional file 1, Figure S1). For each reporter, all inhibitors at 20 nM caused detectable fold changes in luciferase
signal relative to the negative control. However, there was
no consensus on crossreactivity ranking. For example, in
both the let-7a and let-7c reporter assays, the let-7a and
let-7c inhibitors caused a similar response in luciferase
signal (approximately ninefold increase at 20 nM),
whereas the let-7b inhibitor caused a lower response
(approximately five-fold increase at 20 nM) (Figure 1b,
Figure 1d). These data imply that the let-7a and let-7c
inhibitors crossreact equally with each other, whereas the
let-7b inhibitor has lower crossreactivity. However, in the
let-7b reporter assay, the effects of the let-7a and let-7b
inhibitors were similar (approximately sevenfold increase
at 20 nM), whereas the effects of the let-7c inhibitor were
much greater (approximately 13-fold increase at 20 nM)
(Figure 1c). These latter data suggest that there is equivalent crossreactivity between the let-7a and the let-7b
inhibitors, and leaves the let-7c crossreactivity open to
interpretation. One plausible explanation is that multiple
let-7 miRNAs are present in HeLa cells at varying concentrations and that both inhibitors and luciferase

Inhibitors of non-family members do not exhibit
crossreactivity

To determine crossreactivity between unrelated (nonfamily member) miRNA inhibitors, we focused our studies on miR-21 and miR-122. Both miRNAs are the sole
human representatives of their respective families, but
were found to have about 52% sequence similarity (Figure
2a). To test the level of crossreactivity, inhibitor/reporter
pairs of miR-21 and miR-122 were co-transfected into
Huh-7 cells, in which both miRNAs are expressed.
Whereas the miR-21 inhibitor showed strong, dosedependent inhibition of the endogenous miRNA targeting the miR-21 reporter, the miR-122 inhibitor induced
no response in miR-21 reporter activity (Figure 2b). Similarly, the miR-122 inhibitor showed dose-dependent inhibition of the endogenous miRNA targeting the miR-122
reporter, whereas the miR-21 inhibitor induced no
response in miR-122 reporter activity (Figure 2b). Differences in the relative amounts of endogenous miR-21 vs.
miR-122 are suggested by the 30-fold vs. sevenfold
respective inhibition seen at the highest inhibitor doses.
Thus, no evidence of crossreactivity was detected
between the miRNAs, inhibitors and reporters of the two
unrelated miRNAs that share sequence similarity (Figure
2b).
The effects of mismatches on function of inhibitors of miR21, miR-22 and miR-122, as detected by luciferase
reporters, indicate that similar regions are important in all
three cases

In the studies described above, we found that inhibitors
for miRNAs that differ at only a few nucleotides crossreacted, whereas miRNAs that differ at multiple (7 to 10)
nucleotides did not. To study the effect of mismatches in
inhibitor target sites (the site where the miRNA binds) on
inhibitor functionality, systematically mismatched inhibitors were tested for miRNAs represented by only a single
family member (for ease of data interpretation) in cell
lines in which they are strongly expressed (for best signal
to noise ratio in inhibitor assays) (Figure 2b; also see
Additional file 1, Figure S2). For the three selected miRNAs (miR-21, miR-122 and miR-22), sets of inhibitor

molecules containing two consecutive mismatches across
the inhibitor target site were synthesized. The positions
of these mismatches were numbered according to the
positions in the mature miRNA to which they will pair
(for example: positions 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6) (Figure
3). Thus, positions numbered 2 to 7 correspond to the
site where the six-mer seed region of the mature miRNA
would base pair.
For all three miRNAs tested, mismatches causing greatest interference with inhibitor activity are located within
positions corresponding to the seed region of the mature
miRNAs (positions 3 to 8) and a second region closer to
the 3' end (positions 13 to 18) (Figure 4). The purine and
pyrmidine composition for the mismatches were examined to determine if mismatch identity affects the level of
inhibition; no trend was observed in this set of data.
However, for each of the three miRNAs, the exact positions within the two identified regions that were most
deleterious for inhibitor function varied. The most detrimental mismatches within each miRNA were at positions
3 to 4 and 13 to 18 in miR-21 (Figure 4a; 20 nM), positions 3 to 8 and 15 to 16 in miR-122 (Figure 4b; 2 nM) and
positions 5 to 8 and 13 to 16 in mIR-22 (Figure 4c; 0.3
nM). For all three miRNAs tested, mismatches located at
the beginning (positions 1 and 2), end (positions 19 to 22)

dependence of specificity. (a) Schematic showing miR-22 mature
micro(mi)RNA sequence that is perfectly complementary to the central region of the hairpin inhibitor target site. (b) Sequences of mir-22
inhibitor target sites used in the mismatch study. Each inhibitor contained two consecutive mismatches (underlined) that are moved
across the target site. Nucleotides were mismatched by substituting
the reverse complement for the original nucleotide. Numbering of

they would pair. The nucleotides that would pair with the seed region
of the miRNA are indicated by shading.

and middle (positions 9 and 10) of the inhibitor target site
had the least effect on inhibitor function (Figure 4).
In this study, it was observed that changes in inhibitor
efficacy due to mismatches were affected by miRNA
expression levels and inhibitor concentration. Endogenous miRNA downregulation of the luciferase reporter,
compared with the psiCHECK-2 vector without insert,
suggests that miR-21, miR-22 and miR-122 are expressed
at varying levels (Additional file 1, Figure S2). The effects
of mismatches on inhibitor functionality were most pronounced in the case of miR-21 in HeLa cells, where
approximately 70-fold inhibition was observed at the 20
nM dose for the most effective inhibitors, whereas the
least effective inhibitors showed only a fivefold inhibition.
However, at the 2 nM inhibitor dose, where the fully
matched miR-21 inhibitor maintained approximately 60fold inhibition, even the most effective inhibitors containing mismatches showed only 20 to 30-fold inhibition,
and the least effective inhibitors containing mismatches
showed no inhibition (Figure 4a). For miR-122, the best
inhibitors produced approximately sevenfold inhibition
at both 20 nM and 2 nM, indicating that there was a
much lower amount of active endogenous miRNA present. The effects of mismatches on inhibitor efficacy were
most apparent at the 2 nM dose, where the least functional inhibitors containing mismatches showed approximately 1.5-fold inhibition (Figure 4b). For miR-22, for
which the maximum inhibition observed was approximately fourfold, the effects of mismatches on inhibitor
efficacy were most evident at the 0.3 nM inhibitor dose
(Figure 4c). Our data indicate that increased inhibitor
concentration can overcome some reduction in functionality due to moderately unfavorable mismatches and,
conversely, decreased inhibitor concentration can
improve the specificity of inhibitors.
The effects of mismatches on miR-122 inhibitor function, as
detected by mRNA levels of an endogenous target gene,
are similar to the effects observed with luciferase reporters

To determine whether the data observed in luciferase
reporter assays could be extended to endogenous gene
targets, we tested the effects of miR-122 inhibitors containing mismatches on the endogenous miR-122 target
ALDOA [16-19,25]. The miR-122 mismatched inhibitors
used in the reporter assays above were introduced into
Huh-7 cells (doses ranging from 0.8 to 100 nM, data not
shown) and mRNA levels of ALDOA were monitored.
Differential responses between mismatched inhibitors
were most evident for the measurements at 4 nM on day
6 (Figure 5). The mismatches producing the greatest
decreases in inhibitor activity on endogenous mRNA levels (Figure 5, day 6) were those at positions 3 to 8 and 15
to 16, whereas mismatches at positions 1 to 2, 9 to 10 and
19 to 22 had the least effect on inhibitor activity com-

determined for (a) miR-21 in HeLa cells, (b) for miR-122 in Huh-7 cells and (c) for miR-22 in HeLa cells; cell lines were chosen for high expression of the
respective miRNAs. Transfections were performed 1 day after plating into 96-well plates, 10,000 cells/well, in antibiotic-free media. For each microRNA,
the appropriate dual-luciferase reporter, at 100 ng/well, was co-transfected with either a fully matched inhibitor or one of a set of 11 mismatched
inhibitors at concentrations from 0.03 to 20 nM. Dual-luciferase ratios were measured 2 days post-transfection. Results shown are averages from triplicate wells, normalized to appropriate controls, then expressed as fold-inhibition relative to transfection with a negative control. Error bars are Â± 1SD

Figure 5 Mismatched inhibitors show similar positional effects on the expression of an endogenous target. The effect of mismatches on miR122 inhibitor function was determined by measuring steady-state levels of endogenous ALDOA mRNA. The set of miR-122 inhibitors [11 mismatched
and one fully matched, and a negative control (NC) inhibitor] were transfected into Huh-7 cells 1 day after plating into 96-well plates, 10,000 cells/well,
in antibiotic-free media. Media was changed to new, antibiotic-free media approximately every 3 days. Response of ALDOA mRNA levels relative to a
housekeeping gene was measured on day 6 (white bars) and day 9 (grey bars) post-transfection by branched-DNA assay. Results shown are averages
from triplicate wells transfected with 4 nM inhibitor, normalized to appropriate controls, then expressed as fold-inhibition relative to transfection with
the negative control. Error bars are Â± 1SD (sample) of the original triplicate data, scaled for all subsequent calculations.

pared with the fully matched inhibitor. A similar pattern
was observed with the miR-122 luciferase assay (Figure
4b, 2 nM dose) suggesting that conclusions about inhibitor specificity based on reporter assays can be applied to
inhibitor effects on endogenous targets.

Discussion
The results of this study are similar to those of other
inhibitor specificity studies

Although few systematic studies of miRNA inhibitor
specificity have been reported in the literature, the results
from the current study are similar to those from a recent
report of synthetic inhibitors in an in vivo animal model.
Krutzfeldt et al. [19] tested five mismatched molecules of
a synthetic miR-122 antagomir inhibitor. Consistent with
our findings, (adjusting for strand numbering differences)
position 5 was found to be important for function
whereas mismatches to the terminal 3' position had no
effect (position 23 (Krutzfeldt) and positions 21 and 22,
this study). By contrast, in the current study, mismatches
at positions 13 and 14 exhibited a noticeable effect on
inhibitor functionality whereas Krutzfeldt et al. saw no
effect with a mismatch at position 13 (position 14 was

untested). The differences observed for position 13 relative to function of the inhibitors are probably due to the
nature of the modification pattern used (two mismatches
versus one mismatch) or to the sensitivity of the assay
system employed. That is, subtle changes are more readily observed in cell culture with a synthetic reporter than
in a mouse model documenting steady-state levels of
miR-122 (by northern blotting) and target gene mRNA
(by reverse transcriptase PCR) in liver preparations.
Small differences in mismatched inhibitor efficacy between
the three miRNAs are probably due to sequence specific
effects

Although regions of importance common to all three
miRNA inhibitors tested were very evident, there were
slight differences observed in inhibitor responses to mismatches at particular locations. For example, within the
seed region, the 3 to 4 mismatch was especially detrimental for miR-21 inhibitor function, whereas it was the least
perturbing for miR-22 inhibitor function. One reasonable
explanation for such differences may be sequence dependence, but in the example given, the mismatched pair was
CG for both miR-21 and miR-22 (see Additional file 1,
Table 2). Although we could discern no obvious

sequence-dependent pattern in our limited set of comparisons, several studies performed to assess the specificity of binding between a small interfering (si)RNA or
miRNA and the target mRNA have shown that the identity of the specific nucleotide(s) can influence the effect of
a mismatch at a particular site [11,26-28]. While the
miRNA-synthetic inhibitor interaction is analogous to
the miRNA-mRNA interaction, we acknowledge that
inhibitor 2'-O-methyl nucleotide modifications increase
binding affinity to the mature miRNA and this limits
comparison of our study with the miRNA/siRNA-mRNA
studies.
Comparisons between miRNA-inhibitor effects and miRNAmRNA interactions

In our study, we found positions 3 to 8 in the inhibitor to
be important for miRNA inhibition. These data are in
agreement with many other studies, which have found
the seed region to be a determinant of miRNA-mRNA
target recognition [9]. Therefore, seed binding during target recognition is a common feature, despite the difference between the experimentally induced miRNAinhibitor interaction (RNA-synthetic 2'-O-methyl-modified oligonucleotide) that produces irreversible sequestration of the miRNA and the endogenous miRNAmRNA (RNA-RNA) interaction that results in gene modulation.
The 3' region, positions 13 to 18, found in the current
study to be crucial for miRNA-inhibitor recognition,
roughly corresponds to the '3' compensatory' or 'beneficial 3' pairing' sites identified in miRNA-mRNA recognition of target sites in expressed reporter 3' untranslated
regions [11,12]. However, in contrast to effects described
previously, we found that with synthetic inhibitors, the 13
to 18 positional effects were as strong as the effects
observed for positions 3 to 8. The variable magnitudes of
effect are presumably related to differences in the type of
target binding that is occurring in the two types of studies. Recent elucidation of an Argonaute protein-DNA
guide strand-RNA target ternary complex crystal structure supports a 'two-state' model for target binding [29].
This is often described as a nucleation step initiating
binding at the seed followed by 'zippering' to form the
remainder of the duplex [30]. It seems reasonable to propose that the chemical modification of the inhibitors
might strongly affect this 'zippering' process.
Analogous to the interaction between mature miRNA
and inhibitor, in vitro studies of miRNA duplex unwinding in Drosophila melanogaster [31] and humans [32]
have found similar positional effects, with mismatches in
the seed and a 3' region having strong effects on unwinding of the mature and passenger miRNA strands. The
authors concluded that the importance of mismatches in
the seed and the 12 to 15 nucleotide regions for unwind-

Page 8 of 11

ing is the reverse of the requirements for complete base
pairing in those regions for miRNA-mRNA recognition.
Results of this study help predict which inhibitors may
crossreact

The mismatch data presented in this study offer guidelines for predicting when synthetic, 2'-O-methyl miRNA
inhibitors may crossreact. Mature miRNA family members that share sequence identity across both the seed
(nucleotides 2 to 8) and the 3' critical region (nucleotides
13 to 18) are likely to have inhibitors that crossreact. An
example of this is the hsa-miR-15a and hsa-miR-15b pair,
which differ from each other at only a few nucleotides, all
of which are outside the seed and the 3' critical region.
Details of nucleotide pairing for examples from the
human miR-15 family (miRBase, http://www.mirbase.org/) are shown in Table 1. A contrasting example, of
family members for which specific inhibitors might be
designed, is the hsa-miR-15a and hsa-miR-16 pair, which
share sequence identity in the seed but differ at nucleotides 14 to 16 within the 3' critical region. Mature miRNAs that are not family members may share considerable
sequence identity, because family members are identified
in miRBase by homology of the entire hairpin, not just
the mature sequence. An example of this is the hsa-miR15a and hsa-miR-497 pair, which share seed sequences
and are also identical at five out of six positions within
the 3' critical region (Table 1). Because specific sequence
contributions are known to affect interactions, it is recommended to test for crossreactivity whenever there is
extensive identity in both the seed and the 3' critical
regions. Therefore, although it is not possible to establish
absolute criteria for predicting inhibitor crossreactivity,
knowledge of the regions important in determining specificity enables identification of potential crossreacting
miRNAs, which can then be tested.
Crossreactivity of inhibitors could be an advantage in some
cases

miRNA family members that are sufficiently similar to
exhibit inhibitor crossreactivity might also reasonably be
expected to have redundant biological function if coexpressed [33,34]. Therefore, inhibiting multiple family
members at one time could reveal a loss of function phenotype that would be difficult to observe by traditional
genetic knockout studies [35,36]. Owing to the high
potency of the studied synthetic inhibitors relative to
endogenous levels of all but the most strongly expressed
miRNA, most inhibitors could be delivered at low doses
and still be highly effective [20]. In addition, due to the
loss of inhibitor specificity observed at higher doses, use
of the lowest effective dose is a desirable goal. In this context, in cases where miRNAs of very similar sequence are
known, an experimental approach likely to produce con-

sistent results would be the use of a pool of inhibitors
designed against a group of related miRNAs, each at a
low dose, rather than a single inhibitor.

Conclusions
We have conducted a systematic study of the effect on
inhibitor functionality of mismatches in the target sites of
three human miRNA inhibitors. We conclude that the
seed region (position 3 to 8) and a 3' region (position 13
to 18) are equally important in determining recognition
of the inhibitor target by endogenous miRNAs for the
type of chemically modified, synthetic inhibitor we studied. From the literature, it is apparent that these rules may
not be universally applicable to other types of inhibitors,
especially those involving multiple, endogenously
expressed target sites. For our design of inhibitor, we can
use results of the mismatch study to identify potential
crossreacting miRNAs in the miRBase database. A recommendation that arises from these results is that use of
a pool of inhibitors targeting all of the potential crossreacting miRNAs should produce the most consistent
results from inhibitor experiments. Owing to the strong
influence of dose on inhibitor specificity, use of the minimal effective dose is recommended.
Methods
miRNA inhibitors

All inhibitors were fully 2'-O-methylated molecules
(miRIDIAN Hairpin inhibitor design; Dharmacon Products, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lafayette, CO, USA) [20]
(Figure 3a). The negative control inhibitors used in these

studies are based on Caenorhabditis elegans miRNAs not
found in humans [miRIDIAN miRNA Hairpin Inhibitor
Negative Controls 1 (cat. no. IN-001005-01) and 2 (cat.
no. IN-002005-01)]. Mismatched inhibitors contain two
consecutive mismatches (for example, positions 1 and 2,
3 and 4, 5 and 6) across the target site. Sequences for all
inhibitor target sites in this study are reported in Figure 3
or Additional file 1, Table S1 and Table S2.
Cell culture and transfection

Huh-7, a liver-derived cell line from Japan (gift of T.
Hodges), was cultured in modified Eagle's medium (high
glucose) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. This cell line is known to have moderate to high
endogenous levels of miR-122 [17,25,37]. All other cell
lines used in this study were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection and cultured under recommended conditions.
For transfection, cells were plated into 96-well plates,
with 10,000 cells/well in serum-containing media without
antibiotics, and transfected approximately 24 hours after
plating. For luciferase assays, the test inhibitor molecule
and the respective dual luciferase reporter or control
plasmid (cat. no. C8021; psiCHECKâ¢-2; Promega, Foster
City, CA, USA) were co-transfected into cells using transfection reagents (cat. no. 2010; DharmaFECTÂ® Duo
[Thermo Fisher Scientific] or cat. no. 11668; Lipofectamine 2000 [Invitrogen Corp., Carslbad, CA, USA])
according to the manufacturers' instructions, at 0.2 to 0.4
Î¼g/well. Inhibitor concentrations varied between approximately 0.03 and 21 nM, whereas reporter and control

Robertson et al. Silence 2010, 1:10
http://www.silencejournal.com/content/1/1/10

plasmid concentrations remained constant at 100 ng/
well.
For assays of the endogenous human aldolase A
(ALDOA) gene (NM_000034) response to miRNA modulation, cells were transfected with the miR-122 hairpin
inhibitor over a concentration range of 0.8 to 100 nM
using 0.2 Î¼g/well transfection reagent (cat. no. T-2001;
DharmaFECT 1; Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to
the manufacturer's instructions. In cases where cells were
cultured for longer than 3 days post-transfection, the
media was replaced with new growth media approximately every 3 days.
Dual-Luciferase reporters and assay

The dual-luciferase reporters were all derived from the
psiCHECK-2 vector (cat. no. C8021; Promega) and contain a single target site, fully complementary to the
mature miRNA [38-40] (miRBase; http://www.mirbase.org/) cloned into the the 3' untranslated region of
the modified Renilla luciferase (hRluc) gene. These constructs were used in conjunction with a commercial assay
system (cat. no. E2920, E2940 and E2980; Dual-Gloâ¢
Luciferase Assay System; Promega). Because this assay
measures protein activity, these reporters show luciferase
response from both cleavage and non-cleavage targeting
[20]. Assays were performed 48 hours post-transfection;
further details of assay design and instrumentation are
provided in Vermeulen et al. [20]. Renilla luciferase/firefly luciferase (Rluc/Fluc) values are the average of triplicate wells; error bars are Â± 1 SD (sample) of the original
average, scaled for subsequent ratio calculations.
Reported values are the ratio of the reporter plasmid signal to the control plasmid (psiCHECK-2) signal normalized to the ratio obtained from co-transfection with
matched amounts of non-targeting inhibitor controls.

Cell viability
Cell viability was assessed using an indicator dye (alamarBlueÂ®; BioSource International, Inc., Camarillo, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. For all data
reported in this study, no cell viability differences were
observed between the reporter and control (psiCHECK2) plasmid treatments (data not shown).
Endogenous ALDOA mRNA quantification

Levels of both ALDOA and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans
isomerase B (PPIB) (NM_000942, measured as the reference housekeeping gene) mRNAs were determined using
the branched DNA assay (cat. no. QG-000-050; QuantiGene Screen Kit; Panomics Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) [41].
Knockdown of ALDOA was assessed as a change in the
ratio of ALDOA to PPIB with different treatments, measured at 6 and 9 days post-transfection.
