NURR1 in Parkinson disease—from
pathogenesis to therapeutic potential
Mickael Decressac, Nikolaos Volakakis, Anders Björklund and Thomas Perlmann
Abstract | In Parkinson disease (PD), affected midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons lose specific dopaminergic
properties before the neurons die. How the phenotype of DA neurons is normally established and the ways
in which pathology affects the maintenance of cell identity are, therefore, important considerations. Orphan
nuclear receptor NURR1 (NURR1, also known as NR4A2) is involved in the differentiation of midbrain DA
neurons, but also has an important role in the adult brain. Emerging evidence indicates that impaired NURR1
function might contribute to the pathogenesis of PD: NURR1 and its transcriptional targets are downregulated
in midbrain DA neurons that express high levels of the disease-causing protein α‑synuclein. Clinical and
experimental data indicate that disrupted NURR1 function contributes to induction of DA neuron dysfunction,
which is seen in early stages of PD. The likely involvement of NURR1 in the development and progression of PD
makes this protein a potentially interesting target for therapeutic intervention.

Introduction
Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by progressive
degeneration of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons in
the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta and accumu­
lation of intraneuronal Lewy bodies containing mis­
folded α‑synuclein in affected brain areas. Other brain
regions are affected in the disease, but important
motor symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor
and postural instability, are associated with deficient
DA neurotransmission.1
Previous studies have demonstrated that striatal DA,
and other markers of axonal integrity and synaptic func­
tion, are diminished in PD long before cell bodies within
the SN actually die.2 The disease has an early and profound
effect on the properties of differentiated DA neurons,
which implies that the mechanisms that normally main­
tain the cellular identity—the phenotype—of midbrain
DA neurons are important considerations. During devel­
opment, the identity of DA neurons is established by the
activities of transcription factors that are expressed in
the differentiating cells. NURR1 (also known as NR4A2)
is one of these developmental transcription factors and is
also expressed in mature DA neurons in the adult brain.
NURR1 function seems to be perturbed in patients with
PD and, in rodents, Nurr1 deficiency is associated
with cellular changes that resemble early stages of disease.
In this article, we review studies that have explored
the function of NURR1 in mature DA neurons, and
describe the emerging evidence for a link between
disrupted NURR1 function and PD. We describe the
processes that NURR1 regulates, and discuss the ways
in which these processes might be associated with PD

patho­genesis, and the prospect of using NURR1 as a
potential PD drug target.

Role of NURR1 in DA neurons
NURR1 belongs to the family of ligand-activated
transcription factors called nuclear receptors. Unlike
most other nuclear receptors, NURR1 lacks a hydro­
phobic pocket for ligand binding and might, therefore,
function as a ligand-independent nuclear receptor
(Figure 1).3,4 NURR1 binds to specific DNA binding
sites, either as a monomer or homodimer, and can
function as a constitutively active transcription factor.
However, NURR1 can also form heterodimers with the
retinoid X receptor (RXR) that are robustly activated
by RXR ligands.5 NURR1 was first shown to be associ­
ated with DA neuron function by its critical involve­
ment in midbrain DA neuron development.6 Nurr1 is
expressed in the ventral midbrain early in post-mitotic
cells (from embryonic day 10.5 in mice) as they begin
to express features of DA neurons such as tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic amino acid carboxylase
(AADC). Importantly, genetic ablation of Nurr1 in mice
revealed that this gene is required for development of
midbrain DA neurons.7 Nurr1-deficient cells initially
express some DA neuron markers, although they are
unable to innervate their normal forebrain target areas.
DA neurons are absent in the SN and the ventral teg­
mental area in newborn homozygous Nurr1-deficient
(Nurr1–/–) mice.7 By contrast, DA neurons in other parts
of the brain develop normally.
That a transcription factor important for developing
DA neurons would be interesting from the perspec­
tive of PD is not necessarily intuitive. However, Nurr1
continues to be expressed in postnatal DA neurons,

progressive nigrostriatal dysfunction, a characteristic of
PD, has been noted in aged Nurr1+/– mice.11
The increased vulnerability of DA neurons in hetero­
zygous Nurr1 +/– mice might reflect a developmental
defect of the Nurr1± genotype rather than a role for
Nurr1 in maintaining the function in mature neurons.
However, definitive evidence for a role for Nurr1 in the
maintenance and survival of mature DA neurons has
been provided by conditional gene targeting of Nurr1 in
mice, both in late-differentiating DA neurons and in the
adult brain. Ablation of Nurr1 in maturing DA neurons
has been achieved by crossing conditional Nurr1 gene
targeted (floxed) mice with mice carrying Cre recombi­
nase under control of the dopamine transporter (DAT;
also known as SLC6A3) locus. This late developmental
knockout leads to rapid loss of striatal DA, loss of mid­
brain DA neuron markers, and loss of SN DA neuron cell
bodies and striatal innervation.12 To ablate Nurr1 in adult
DA neurons, Nurr1 floxed mice were crossed with mice
harbouring a CreERT2 allele under the control of the
DAT locus, which enables tamoxifen-induced ablation
of the Nurr1 gene in adult brains. These mice exhibit
progressive DA neuron pathology associated with a
modest reduction of DA neuron markers in ventral mid­
brain and striatum, reduced striatal DA, and impaired
motor behaviour.13 Interestingly, these mice also show
progressive development of TH‑positive dystrophic
dendrites—a sign of pathology that has been noted in
early human PD. 2 Collectively, these results demon­
strate that Nurr1 ablation in adult mice recapitulates
early features of PD and support the idea that Nurr1
loss-of-function might contribute to PD.

and accumulating evidence indicates that Nurr1 has
an important role in the ongoing maintenance of these
cells. DA neurons of heterozygous Nurr1-deficient
(Nurr1+/–) mice seem to have an increased susceptibility
to toxic stress including conditions that are known to
have an effect on DA neuron survival, such as exposure
to the mitochondrial toxin 1‑methyl‑4-phenyl‑1,2,3,6-­
tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), the proteasome inhibi­
tor lactacystin, and metamphetamine. 8–10 Moreover,

Mutations that affect NURR1 function could compro­
mise the ability of neurons to exert their normal func­
tion and cope with environmental or endogenous stress,
thereby triggering pathological changes that lead to PD.
Mutations in the NURR1 gene have not been identified
as major genetic risk factors for PD. However, a poly­
morphism (7048–7049insG) in intron 6 of NURR1 that
potentially affects splicing of the gene has been found at
higher frequency in patients with familial and sporadic
PD compared with healthy individuals.14–17 An intron
7 variant (IVS7+33C>T) has also been reported, but
only in one patient with PD.18 Two mutations (–291delT
and –245T>G) in the noncoding exon 1 within the
5ʹ untranslated region of NURR1 have also been reported
in 10 individuals of European descent with familial PD.19
These variants decrease NURR1 expression in transfected
cell lines and in lymphocytes from affected individuals,
implying a hypomorphic effect of the mutated allele.
Three other variations in exon 1 (–253C>T, –223C>T
and –309C>T) were found in patients with sporadic PD,
with the –309C>T mutation resulting in reduced NURR1
mRNA expression and altered striatal gene expression
in brain tissue.20,21 All of these polymorphisms affect
intronic or noncoding parts of the NURR1 gene. Only

transcriptional activation, 22 has been identified in a
patient with nonfamilial PD.23
The mutations in the NURR1 locus that are associ­
ated with an increased risk of PD have a low prevalence,
suggesting that the genetic component of sporadic PD
that can be attributed to changes in NURR1 function is
quite limited. However, even if NURR1 is not a major
susceptibility locus for PD, other insults that influence
NURR1 expression or function might be involved. Of
note, NURR1 expression is downregulated in post­
mortem human brain tissue from neuropathologically
verified cases of sporadic PD,24,25 specifically in SN DA
neurons with α‑synuclein inclusions.25 The decline in
NURR1 expression correlates with loss of TH immuno­
fluorescence, which suggests that decreased NURR1
expression might underlie decreased production of DA,
and DA‑neuron degeneration.
An age-related decline of the number of NURR1expressing DA neurons, with age-related decreases in both
NURR1 and TH expression within individual neurons, has
been noted in the ageing human brain.26,27 Given that ageing
is associated with a decline of DA neurons in the SN28 and
that advancing age is one of the primary risk factors for
PD, a role for the age-related decline in NURR1 expression
in the occurrence of PD is a tempting proposal. The fact
that, in PD, NURR1 loss is restricted to DA neurons with
signs of pathology also seems to link NURR1 to the disease
process. However, the correlative nature of the associations
between alterations in PD and in the ageing brain should be
emphasized, and it remains unclear whether the decrease
in NURR1 expression noted in these studies is causally
linked to loss of DA phenotype. Nonetheless, the data
from conditional knockout mice do seem to indicate that
a decline in Nurr1 expression could be linked to develop­
ment and progression of PD pathology and, in particular,
in the development of early functional and degenerative
changes that are seen in affected DA neurons. Finally,
also intriguing to note is the identification of NURR1 as
a potential peripheral PD biomarker, as demonstrated
by downregulation of NURR1 expression in peripheral
blood lymphocytes from patients with PD, in­dependent
of medication, disease severity or duration.29–31 These
interesting observations warrant further exploration
in large and stratified cohorts of well-characterized
patients, particularly those in early-stage PD.

Regulation of mitochondrial genes
How would deficient or decreased NURR1 function affect
DA neurons in PD? NURR1 is a transcription factor that
regulates gene expression in developing and mature DA
neurons. It has been linked to the regulation of several genes
that encode proteins with functions in DA metabolism,
neurotransmission and axonal growth, which supports a
role for NURR1 in establishment and maintenance of the
DA neurotransmitter phenotype.7,32–37 Moreover, NURR1
controls important genes that are involved not only in the
differentiation, but also the survival, of DA neurons.34,37–40
These targets include proto-­oncogene tyrosine-­protein
kinase receptor Ret (Ret), which encodes the signal­
ling receptor for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic

factor (GDNF).7,41,42 Such a target points to an involve­
ment of NURR1 in regulation of DA neuron survival via
maintained neurotrophic signalling (discussed below).
Conditional ablation of the Nurr1 gene, performed by
tamoxifen treatment in adult mice, has enabled the study
of dysregulated Nurr1 target genes in adult DA neurons.
Laser-capture microdissection of SN and ventral tegmen­
tal area DA neurons was combined with next-generation
mRNA sequencing to identify Nurr1 dysregulated genes
1 week after Nurr1 ablation.13 Interestingly, the main
functional category of downregulated genes in Nurr1ablated neurons was nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
genes, including genes important in oxidative phos­
phory­l ation. Strikingly, analysis of large regulatory
trends revealed that 90% of the genes that encode pro­
teins involved in oxidative phosphorylation are down­
regulated in Nurr1-deficient DA neurons, which suggests
an important function of Nurr1 in sustaining sufficient
respiratory activity in these cells.
Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated as a
major contributor to PD pathology.43 Particularly intrigu­
ing is the fact that genes encoding proteins involved in
oxidative phosphorylation correspond to the functional
category of genes that are most dysregulated in remain­
ing DA neurons in PD, as demonstrated by a large metaanalysis of genome-wide gene expression studies.44 The
decreased NURR1 expression observed in patients with
PD might, therefore, influence the level of oxidative
phosphorylation, and possibly the respiratory function,
in remaining DA neurons. The exact mechanism by which
NURR1 affects the expression of mitochondrial genes is
not yet understood. NURR1 might functionally inter­
act with other transcription factors that are required for
expression of nuclear respiratory genes, such as the nuclear
respiratory factors NRF1 and NRF2, or with the transcrip­
tional co-activator peroxisome proliferator-­activated
receptor-γ co-activator 1α (PGC‑1α), which serves as a
master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular
respiration.45 Future studies to analyse the level of oxida­
tive phosphorylation in models of NURR1 ablation and
overexpression might clarify these issues.

Neuroprotection and neuroinflammation
In addition to mitochondrial dysfunction, excito­
toxicity and oxidative stress have been implicated in
the pathology of many disorders associated with neuro­
degeneration, including PD.46,47 Cyclic AMP-responsive
element-binding protein (CREB) is a transcription
factor that is activated in response to these patho­
physiological effectors and regulates a gene expression
programme that is essential for neuronal protection.
Nurr1 is a medi­ator of CREB-dependent neuroprotec­
tive responses in neurons exposed to excitotoxic and
oxidative stress, and is also a regulator of neuroprotec­
tive genes.48 Moreover, synaptic N‑methyl‑d-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor activation induces CREB-mediated
neuroprotection49 and leads to upregulation of Nurr1.50–52
NMDA receptor-­induced Nurr1 expression has also been
linked to induced expression of the survival-promoting
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).53

REVIEWS
The above findings confirm previous observations on
the protective effect of increased Nurr1 levels against oxi­
dative stress,54–56 and indicate that Nurr1 is an essential
component of a neuroprotective regulatory mechanism
downstream of CREB, and is critical for maintenance of
neuronal integrity after insults to the brain. A functional
partner of Nurr1 in this adaptive response to neuronal
stress could be PGC‑1α which, in addition to being a
key transcriptional regulator of energy metabolism,
also functions as a suppressor of reactive oxygen species
in neurons. PGC‑1α44,57,58 is also induced by oxidative
stress via CREB and seems to represent a parallel and
complementary CREB-dependent regulatory neuro­
protective pathway.48 Evidence suggests that expression
of PGC‑1α might also be perturbed in patients with PD.
Interestingly, PGC‑1α is a major regulator of nuclearencoded mitochondrial genes, providing another
functional link between these two proteins. However,
PGC‑1α has not been reported to be a major co-­activator
of NURR1, and it remains unclear whether the two
transcriptional regulators are mechanistically linked.
Finally, apart from apparently having important roles
within DA neurons, NURR1 has been proposed to be
part of an anti-inflammatory pathway in microglia and
astrocytes that protects DA neurons from inflammationinduced death. Neuroinflammation is associated with
activated microglia and increased levels of proinflamma­
tory mediators, and might contribute to PD pathology.59
Nurr1 is induced in mouse microglia in vivo after lipopoly­
saccharide stereotaxic injection (which generates an
animal model of PD).60 In mice in which Nurr1 is knocked
down in microglia and astrocytes through delivery of
lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA, lipopolysaccha­
ride injection results in loss of DA neurons in the SN and
increased expression of inflammatory mediators, indicat­
ing that Nurr1 expressed in glia could act as an inhibitor of
inflammatory cytokines secreted by activated microglia.60

A mediator of α‑synuclein toxicity

As outlined in the discussion above, NURR1 is essential
for maintenance of nigral DA neurons under normal
physiological conditions, as well as under conditions
of cellular damage and stress. A mechanism whereby
NURR1 might be important for DA neuron maintenance
is via neurotrophic signalling by regulation of the GDNF
receptor Ret. Conditional ablation of Gdnf, Ret or Nurr1
in adult mice results in progressive pathological changes
that resemble early stages of PD.13,61,62 These observa­
tions support the critical role of the Gdnf–Ret–Nurr1
pathway in preservation of nigral DA neuron integrity
and function. Exogenously administered GDNF is a
potent pro-survival factor for midbrain DA neurons that
can provide neuroprotection against 6‑hydroxydopamine
and 1‑methyl‑4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) toxicity in
cell culture63–65 and in toxin-based rodent and primate
models of PD.66–71 Owing to these promising preclinical
results, a number of clinical trials have been undertaken
that involve administration of GDNF either into the
cerebro­ventricular system, or directly into the putamen,
in patients with advanced PD. 72–74 In an alternative

approach, another member of the GDNF family, neur­
turin, has been expressed in the putamen, or in the
putamen and SN, using adeno-associated virus (AAV)
vector gene delivery.75,76 Overall, these trials have given
mixed and inconclusive results, although some patients
have shown a sustained clinical response (associated with
evidence of increased DA activity at the site of delivery
as measured by 18F-DOPA PET, as well as increased
TH immunoreactivity in a single postmortem case).73
Understanding the basis for the failure of GDNF and
neurturin to provide substantial benefits in clinical trials
is clearly important. The results from our studies now
suggest that α‑synuclein-induced toxicity could directly
interfere with GDNF signalling in DA neurons in patients
with PD. AAV-mediated over­expression of α‑synuclein in
rats can be used as a tool to induce a progressive PD‑like
neurodegenerative process in nigral DA neurons. In this
model, delivery of GDNF, using a treatment protocol that
affords consistent and efficient protection in toxin-based
models, failed to protect the nigral DA neurons against
α‑synuclein-induced toxi­city.77,78 Interestingly, the results
from two independent studies indicated that expression
of Nurr1 was markedly reduced as a consequence of
α‑synuclein toxicity.79,80 This decrease in Nurr1 expres­
sion was observed in both studies despite differences in
experimental design. In contrast to the AAV-mediated
α‑synuclein-overexpression model, the second model
was based on transgenic mouse overexpression of a
mutant form of α‑synuclein (53A>T). Whereas Nurr1
protein but not mRNA downregulation was noted in the
transgenic mouse overexpression model, AAV‑mediated
α-synuclein transduction caused a marked downregula­
tion of both Nurr1 protein and mRNA. This reduction
was observed as early as 2 weeks after vector injection in
the AAV α-synuclein overexpression model—at a time
point at which α‑synuclein is well-expressed but before
any major pathological changes are evident.79 Reductions
in expression of Nurr1 target genes, including Ret, and
blockade of the intracellular response to GDNF (as meas­
ured by markers of the GDNF-induced signalling cascade)
also accompanied this Nurr1 downregulation.79
Observations of both reduced Ret expression and
blockade of the GDNF-induced trophic response in
DA neurons in Nurr1 conditional knockout mice sup­
ports an important role for Nurr1 in PD pathogenesis.
Conversely, forced expression of Nurr1 restores GDNF
signalling in α‑synuclein-overexpressing DA neurons,
and provides near-complete protection of nigral DA
neurons against α‑synuclein toxicity, also in the absence
of exogenous GDNF.79 Ret expression also seems to be
reduced in patients with PD: levels of Ret immuno­
reactivity in neuromelanin-positive DA neurons in
the SN are reduced in patients with PD compared with
age-matched healthy controls.79
Several potential explanations for inefficient Ret sig­
nalling in models of α‑synuclein toxicity exist. However,
these results further support the idea that α‑synuclein
might interfere with GDNF signalling via downregula­
tion of Nurr1 and its transcriptional target Ret, not only in
α‑synuclein overexpression models, but also in human PD.

REVIEWS
Judging from the observations from the AAV α-synuclein
model, the magnitude of Ret downregulation is prob­
ably determined by the level of α‑synuclein expression.
Increased expression of α‑synuclein in nigral DA neurons
in PD is likely to depend on a combination of factors,
including age27 and alterations in lysosomal function.81–83
The increase in α‑synuclein, as well as the changes in
Ret expression, is likely to vary, not only from one DA
neuron to another (as is evident from immuno­stained
sections),25 but between patients. Indeed, from available
data,25 the average cellular NURR1 expression (which we
assume will correlate with Ret expression) varies about
twofold among patients with PD, from about half of
normal to within the range seen in healthy, age-matched
controls. Taken together, these observations point to the
GDNF–Ret–NURR1 pathway as an interesting target for
therapeutic interventions in PD.

α-Synuclein and NURR1 interactions

The impairment of NURR1 function that is induced by
α‑synuclein overexpression raises the question of how,
and by which molecular mechanisms, α‑synuclein affects
NURR1 expression. Interestingly, NURR1 is not the only
transcription factor that is affected by α‑synuclein over­
expression. Other transcription factors that are critical
for neuronal survival—myocyte enhancer factor-2D,
DNA methyltransferase 1, and the transcription factor
EB—are also affected in α‑synuclein-based models
of PD, as well as in nigral DA neurons in postmortem
human PD brain. 84–86 These observations point to a
possible action of α‑synuclein in the nucleus.
α-Synuclein function has so far been almost exclu­
sively studied in the cytoplasm (where it has a role in
synaptic function) but, as its name implies, this protein
has also been shown to localize to the cell nucleus in
physiological conditions as well as in various in vitro
and in vivo disease models.79,87–91 However, the influence
of nuclear α‑synuclein on neurodegenerative changes
seen in models of PD and, more specifically, the effect
of nuclear α‑synuclein on gene expression are poorly
understood. Genome-wide-profiling studies have high­
lighted important molecular pathways involved in PD
pathology that are associated with broad transcriptional
dysregulation,92 and α‑synuclein could plausibly con­
tribute to this phenomenon. The results from studies in
cellular and animal models of PD and Lewy body disease
indicate that α‑synuclein has an effect on gene expression
under pathological conditions, but clear evidence for the
involvement of α‑synuclein on transcriptional regulation
in normal, unperturbed cells is lacking.
As shown in Drosophila melanogaster, α‑synuclein
targeted to the nucleus promotes toxicity, whereas cyto­
plasmic sequestration is protective.93 In the nucleus,
α‑synuclein binds directly to histones, thereby inhibiting
acetylation by histone acetyltransferases. The toxi­city of
α‑synuclein can be blocked by administration of histone
deacetylase inhibitors, both in cell culture and in trans­
genic flies.93 Similar results have been obtained in rodent
models of PD, in which overexpression of α‑synuclein
induces a reduction in histone acetyltransferase p300,

several genes involved in neurotransmission and DA metabolism, including TH,

regulating expression of Ret, the signalling receptor for GDNF and other neurotrophic
factors. NURR1 also controls expression of several nuclear-encoded mitochondrial
genes such as SOD1, TSFM and COX5β, and seems important for sustained
respiratory function. NURR1 is a target of the pathology-promoting α‑synuclein, and
expression of NURR1 is reduced by α‑synuclein overexpression. Many other genes
are probably also downregulated owing to α‑synuclein toxicity. α‑Synuclein might
interfere with GDNF signalling via repression of NURR1 and its transcriptional target
Ret. Abbreviations: COX5β, cyclo-oxygenase 5β; DA, dopamine; DAT, dopamine

which results in decreased histone acetylation. 79,94
In support of a pathological effect of α‑synuclein
on gene expression, increased chromatin binding of
nuclear α‑synuclein has been reported in SN tissue from
patients with PD compared with age-matched controls.95
Furthermore, treatment with histone deacetylase inhibi­
tors can provide protection in in vitro and in vivo models
of α‑synuclein toxicity.93,96
The above observations provide support for the idea
that the changes induced by α‑synuclein in the nucleus
might drive at least part of the pathological process,
and that NURR1 is one of the targets that is directly or
indirectly affected. More studies are needed, however,
to answer important questions regarding the type, or
molecular form, of α‑synuclein (monomer or oligomer,
phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated) that affects gene
expression, the way α‑synuclein accesses the nucleus
(localization signal or by binding to partners) and the
mechanism by which α‑synuclein interferes with tran­
scription (direct or indirect binding to transcription
factors, or direct binding to DNA).

Clinical perspective
NURR1 has multiple roles via regulation of genes encod­
ing proteins that are involved in DA neurotransmis­
sion (Figure 2). Regulatory targets of NURR1 include
CREB-induced survival proteins, nuclear-encoded mito­
chondrial genes and the neurotrophic signalling recep­
tor Ret. Therefore, drugs designed to activate NURR1
function seem likely to be of therapeutic relevance for

patients with PD. Such drugs might not only be power­
ful as neuroprotective agents by themselves, but could
also be useful as a tool to increase the efficacy of neuro­
protective therapies based on GDNF or neurturin deliv­
ery. Despite filling of the receptor pocket by hydrophobic
side chains (Figure 1), NURR1 might retain the ability to
bind small compounds that could be used to modulate
its activity. Indeed, although the exact modes of action
remain uncertain, several NURR1-activating compounds
have been identified.97–105 RXR could also be a target for
modulation of NURR1-regulated processes, as NURR1
can form hetero­dimers with RXR that are efficiently
activated by RXR ligands (Figure 1). However, whether
NURR1–RXR heterodimers are associated with any of
the important functions mediated by NURR1 in DA
neurons remains unclear. Moreover, RXR is a pleiotropic
heterodimer partner of several other nuclear recep­
tors, and RXR ligands will presumably regulate genes
independently of NURR1 and lead to adverse effects.
Alternatively, develop­ment of RXR-binding ligands that
selectively activate NURR1–RXR heterodimers might
be possible.106,107
Viral vector delivery of NURR1 protects DA neurons
from α‑synuclein-mediated toxicity.79 Such an interven­
tion—alone or in combination with GDNF or neur­
turin—is, therefore, an interesting alternative approach
that could be considered in future preclinical research.
NURR1 is expressed in cells other than midbrain DA
neurons, both inside and outside the brain, so the ability
of local vector delivery to target NURR1 expression speci­
fically to the affected DA neurons is an attractive feature
of such gene therapy. In one clinical trial, AAV–neurturin
was delivered to patients with PD at two sites in the brain
(the putamen and the SN). The outcome of this trial
was negative.108 However, clinical response to this treat­
ment might improve if the nigral injection is replaced or
combined with an injection of an AAV–NURR1 vector.

Conclusions
The effect of α‑synuclein in the pathogenesis of PD has,
so far, been focused on its role in the cytoplasm, and the
impairment of cellular functions through the production
of toxic molecular species and oligomers. Evidence now
suggests, however, that α‑synuclein enters the nucleus
and exerts an effect on the genomic level that results in
detrimental changes in the expression of genes involved
in maintenance and survival of midbrain DA neurons.
The studies reviewed here identify NURR1 as a central
player in this genomic cascade, and show that the reduc­
tion in NURR1 levels observed in midbrain DA neurons
that overexpress α‑synuclein, as well as in nigral
neurons in human PD, is accompanied by impaired
expression of important proteins involved in dopamin­
ergic neurotransmission. For example, a marked reduc­
tion in the expression of the GDNF receptor, Ret, and an
almost complete blockade of GDNF trophic signalling in
the affected DA neurons has been reported. We propose
that reduced NURR1 expression, induced by increased
cellular levels of α‑synuclein, has an important part in
induction of DA neuron dysfunction in early stages of
PD, and that loss of NURR1 contributes to development
and progression of degenerative changes in the affected
DA neurons. Together, the clinical and experimental
data identify NURR1 as a potential therapeutic target
for disease intervention in patients with PD.
Review criteria
PubMed was searched for peer-reviewed original research
articles in English, published up to July 2013, including
electronic early-release publications. Search terms
included “Parkinson”, “Nurr1 or Nr4a2” and “alpha
synuclein”. The abstracts of retrieved citations were
reviewed and prioritized by relevant content. Full articles
were obtained and secondary references from these
articles were screened for inclusion.
