MicroRNA Signatures in Neurological
Disorders
Gowhar Shafi, Nishat Aliya, Anjana Munshi
ABSTRACT: A class of small, non-coding transcripts called microRNAs (miRNAs) that play a major
role in post-transcriptional gene regulation has recently emerged and become the focus of intense
research. MicroRNAs are abundant in the nervous system, where they have key roles in development
and are likely to be important mediators of plasticity. A highly conserved pathway of miRNA biogenesis
is closely linked to the transport and translatability of mRNAs in neurons. MicroRNAs have been shown
to modulate programmed cell death during development. Although there are nearly 750 known human
miRNA sequences, each of only approximately 20-25 nucleotides in length that bind to multiple mRNA
targets, the accurate prediction of miRNA targets seems to lie just beyond our grasp. Nevertheless, the
identification of such targets promises to provide new insights into many facets of neuronal function. In
this review, we briefly describe miRNA biogenesis and the principle approaches for studying the
function of miRNAs and potential application of miRNAs as biomarkers, diagnostic targets, and
potential therapeutic tools of human diseases in general and neurological disorders in particular.
RÉSUMÉ: Signatures de micro-ARN dans les maladies neurologiques. Une classe de petits transcrits non
codants appelés micro-ARN (miARN), qui jouent un rôle majeur dans la régulation génique post-transcriptionnelle,
sont connus depuis peu et font l’objet de recherches intensives. Les miARN sont abondants dans le système nerveux
où ils jouent des rôles clés au cours du développement et sont vraisemblablement d’importants médiateurs de la
plasticité. Une voie très hautement conservée de biogenèse des miARN est étroitement liée au transport et à la
traductibilité des ARNm dans les neurones. Il a été démontré que les miARN modulent la mort cellulaire
programmée pendant le développement. Bien qu’il y ait près de 750 séquences connues de miARN, chacune
d’environ 20 à 25 nucléotides de long seulement et qui se lient à de multiples cibles d’ARNm, la prédiction exacte
des cibles des miARN semble encore nous échapper. Néanmoins, l’identification de ces cibles fournira sans doute
de nouvelles pistes de recherche sur de nombreux aspects de la fonction neuronale. Dans cette revue, nous décrivons
brièvement la biogenèse des miARN et les principales approches pour l’étude de leur fonction et leurs applications
potentielles comme biomarqueurs, cibles diagnostiques et outils thérapeutiques dans les maladies humaines en
général et les maladies neurologiques en particulier.

The development and function of the nervous system is
orchestrated by a plethora of gene regulatory mechanisms.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a novel class of small non-coding RNAs
(Ribonucleic acid), are effective post-transcriptional regulators
of gene expression1. Since the discovery of miRNAs, it has
become evident that the genomic complexity of a cell is far
greater than expected. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a new class of
non-protein-coding, endogenous, small RNAs that seem to be of
vital importance in the functioning of cells. MicroRNA regulates
gene expression by translational repression, mRNA cleavage,
and mRNA decay initiated by miRNA-guided rapid
deadenylation. These processes are now being recognized as
important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in
the brain. MicroRNAs are an abundant class of endogenous small
RNA molecules with a size varying from 20-25 nucleotides in

length1-4. All pre-miRNAs have hairpin secondary structure1-4.
Some miRNAs are highly conserved from species to species in
animals and plants5-6. These miRNAs have been indicated to be
of great importance in diverse biological process, including cell
cycle regulation, apoptosis, cell differentiation, maintenance of
stemness and imprinting7. The first miRNA (see Figure 1) was
described in 1993, in which the C. elegans heterochronic gene

populations12. These studies have identified numerous genes that
are expressed differently in different populations and suggest
that natural variation in gene expression rather than structural
changes in gene products probably account for a substantial part
of phenotypic variation. However, the molecular basis of
differences in gene expression is still unclear. Identification of
causal genetic variants underlying complex traits is a major goal
in molecular genetic studies. Polymorphisms (see Figure 2) in
miRNA target sites represent a specific class of regulatory
polymorphisms that may regulate posttranscriptional gene
expression. Although each miRNA can control hundreds of
target genes, identifying the accurate miRNA targets for brain
research remains a huge challenge.
BIOGENESIS OF MICRORNAS

Figure 1: The predicted stem loop structure of the two microRNA
molecules first discovered; lin-4 (left) and let-7 (right). The sequence of
mature miRNAs are shown in grey.

lin-4 encoded small RNAs with antisense complementarity to
lin-148. It is estimated that vertebrate genomes encode more than
1,000 unique miRNAs9, which are predicted to regulate
expression of at least 50% of genes10. Though more than 735
miRNAs have been identified in humans, much remains to be
understood about their precise cellular function and role in the
development of diseases.
In recent years, the involvement of miRNA in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders has been assessed. Brain
RNAs become pathologically altered in some neurological
disorders. These changes have been reviewed elsewhere11,12, but
include aberrant RNA oxidation, RNA degradation, altered RNA
splicing and ribosomal changes which cause mRNA translational
frame-shifting abnormalities. MicroRNAs have been implicated
in a number of pathological conditions of the central nervous
system (CNS), ranging from cancer to neurodegenerative
diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease12.
However, a causal link between a specific miRNA and a disease
has been established in just a few cases, and most of the
mechanistic data originates from invertebrate model systems.
MicroRNA expression profiling of human neurological disorders
has led to the identification of signatures correlated with the
diagnosis, staging, progression, prognosis and response to
treatment. MicroRNA fingerprinting can therefore be added to
the diagnostic and prognostic tools used by medical experts.
Recently, microarrays have been used to estimate the
genome-wide variation in gene expression across different
178

Various biochemical approaches have provided a basic
understanding of the molecular details of miRNA biogenesis13. A
primary transcript RNA (pri-miRNA) transcribed from a miRNA
gene by RNA polymerase II is first processed (as shown in
Figure 3) into a stemloop structure of about 70-80 nucleotides
known as precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) by a microprocessor
enzyme comprising of a double-strand (ds)-RNA-specific
ribonuclease, Drosha, with the help of its binding partner
DGCR814. These pre-miRNAs are transported into the cytoplasm
via an Exportin-5-RanGTP dependent mechanism15-17. In the
cytoplasm, they are digested by a second, dsRNA-specific
ribonuclease called Dicer with the help of TRBP and AGO218-20.
The 20-25 nucleotide long fragment released is the mature
miRNA, which is bound by a complex called miRNA-associated
RNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC). Two mechanisms
for miRNA action are currently known: Cleavage and
translational repression of mRNA without RNA cleavage. In
animals, the complex-bound, single stranded miRNAs bind
specific target mRNAs through a sequence that is significantly,
though not completely complementary to the target mRNAs21.

Figure 2: miRNAs from the let-7 family with single nucleotide difference.

LE JOURNAL CANADIEN DES SCIENCES NEUROLOGIQUES

The bound mRNA remains untranslated, resulting in reduced
expression of the corresponding genes by a mechanism that is
not fully understood. A single miRNA could regulate multiple
target genes, while a single gene could be targeted by multiple
miRNAs, suggesting that the miRNAome and mRNAome
interaction is a highly complicated network.
MICRORNAS IN NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS

The first hint that miRNAs might play a variety of roles
within the nervous system came from cloning and expression
analysis of miRNAs. A surprisingly high number of unique
miRNAs were isolated from brain and neuronal cell lines22. A
large number of these microRNAs were associated with
polyribosomes23-24, a hallmark of ongoing translation indicating
that in the nervous system, like in other tissues, miRNAs might
be involved in the regulation of translation.
Suppression of miRNA biogenesis by disrupting the zebrafish
Dicer gene has provided the first evidence that miRNAs are
necessary for the development of the nervous system25. It is
unknown if Dicer plays a similar role during early neural
development in mammals as Dicer deficient mice die at
embryonic day 7.5 before neurulation occurs26. However, recent
conditional gene targeting approaches have shed some light on
the role of the miRNA pathway in the CNS in mammals.
Similarly, progressive cell death was observed when Dicer was
inactivated postnatally in the cerebellum27 or in dopaminergic
neurons in the forebrain28.
In the mature nervous system, miRNAs are emerging as
important regulators of synaptic plasticity, the dynamic
functional and morphological modifications that occur at the
synapse and are thought to underlie higher cognitive functions
such as learning and memory29.
MicroRNAs are involved in a variety of physiological and
pathological processes in multi-cellular organisms, ranging from
patterning to cancer development30. Since the CNS is a rich
source of miRNAs that often display a brain specific expression
pattern (discussed later), and since a single miRNA is able to
target up to a few hundreds of different mRNAs9, it is hardly
surprising that the number of roles assigned to miRNAs during
all stages of CNS development and function is rapidly
expanding.
MicroRNAs have been implicated in a number of
neurological disorders, ranging from cancer to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's11.
Analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in humans
revealed a strong negative selection against mutations in miRNA
binding sites in the 3"UTR31. Thus linkage analysis of diseaseassociated SNPs is likely to reveal several links between
miRNAs and neurological conditions. A first case of a
deleterious polymorphism in a miRNA target mRNA has been
identified in a candidate gene for Tourette's syndrome, SLIT and
Trk-like 1(SLITRK1), whose protein product is necessary for the
growth, guidance and branching of neuronal cells as well as
other associated processes. Two identical mutations in the mir189 binding site on the SLITRK1 3"UTR have been detected in
unrelated afflicted individuals32. The intriguing reduction of mir133 levels in the midbrain of patients with Parkinson's disease
has been shown. Interestingly, neurodegeneration is also
observed in mice that lack Dicer, specifically in the cerebellum.

Figure 3: MicroRNA: Processing and Activity; Depicts the formation of
long primary micro RNA (pri-miRNA) in the nucleus which is processed
by microprocessor complex (Drosha- an RNase III enzyme and Pashadouble stranded RNA binding protein) into pre-microRNA (70 nucleotide
stem loop structure) and transported to cytoplasm by Exportin 5
mediated export, where Dicer, an RNase II enzyme cleaves it to 20 – 23
nucleotide mature micro RNA that integrates it into the microRNA
Inducing Silencing Complex (miRISC), a complex of proteins that is
responsible for regulation of gene expression either by translational
inhibition or target RNA degradation.

In these animals Purkinje neurons progressively degenerate and
the animals develop ataxia27. Further, alterations of miRNA
levels have also been detected in the prefrontal cortex of patients
with schizophrenia33, and SNP-genetic linkage analysis
identified two miRNA loci associated with schizophrenia34.
These correlations await further validation. However, they
strongly suggest a connection between miRNAs and diseases
that affect the dopamine system. A link between miRNAs and
polyglutamine-induced neurodegeneration has recently been
discovered. In this study, toxicity of the spinocerebellar ataxia
type 3 protein was strongly enhanced by mutations of the
drosophila Dicer homologue, and a genetic screen identified the
miRNA Bantam as suppressor of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3
protein toxicity35. The role of the miRNA pathway in the
development of several kinds of cancer is an area of intense
research36. Related to the CNS a set of miRNAs whose
expression is altered in glioblastomas has been identified by
microarray analysis37-38. Intriguingly, inhibition of one of these
miRNAs (mir-21) in a glioblastoma cell line has been shown to
induce apoptosis38, implicating miRNAs as potentially attractive
targets for anti-cancer therapy. In a fetal mouse cerebral cortex
culture model, the pro-apoptotic function of mir-21 was
counteracted by mir-335, where the expression of both miRNAs
was regulated by ethanol exposure. Toxic levels of ethanol
179

THE CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES

suppressed mir-21 expression, while lower levels of ethanol
induced mir-335 expression39 suggesting antagonistic roles of
miRNAs during ethanol induced neurotoxicity. MicroRNAs
continue to be expressed in adult neurons, many at relatively
high levels. A facet of neuronal function to which miRNAmediated regulation seems particularly well suited is local
translational control of plasticity40.
Researchers have reported for the first time the involvement
of miRNA regulation in brain pathogenesis associated with
middle cerebral artery occlusion. They have also provided
evidence that some of the miRNAs that are highly expressed in
the ischemic brain can be detected in blood samples41.
Although recent studies are beginning to unravel how
miRNAs fit into signaling pathways that govern cell fate
decisions, the factors that control miRNA expression and their
precise roles during the acquisition of a specific cell phenotype
are yet to be explicitly elucidated. During cardiogenesis, for
example, serum response factor induces the expression of
muscle-specific miRNA, miR-1, which in turn controls
cardiomyocyte proliferation by down-regulating the Hand2
transcription factor42. Establishment of the left–right asymmetry
of chemosensory neurons in C. elegans also involves a signaling
network of transcription factors and miRNAs43-44. In the
mammalian nervous system, where cellular diversity is extreme,
the factors responsible for miRNA gene regulation are only just
emerging45.
MicroRNAs are also abundantly expressed in the adult brain
and appear to regulate the maintenance of mature neural traits
and synaptic plasticity46-53. Numerous studies suggest that
miRNAs are intimately involved in synaptic function and input
specificity during memory formation40,23,53-56. Moreover,
transcripts encoding synapse-associated proteins also comprise
the largest subgroup of predicted miRNA targets, including
synapsin 1 and the fragile X mental retardation protein57.
METHODS INVOLVED IN MICRORNA STUDY

The small size of miRNAs poses a unique challenge in their
detection, requiring a method that is both highly sensitive and
discriminatory58. Most commercially available technologies for
global miRNA expression profiling are based on DNA
microarrays, in which the probes are spotted onto a glass surface.
Such probes, however, are not optimal for miRNA detection
because of cross-hybridization and lack of specificity;
discrimination between single-nucleotide differences is not
always possible59.
In order to gain insight into these tiny regulators, researchers
around the world are asking fundamental research questions (see
Figure 4). Now that many miRNA sequences are known
(cataloged in the miRBase Sequence Database at http://microrna.
sanger.ac.uk), the next step would be analysis of miRNA
expression levels between different tissues, developmental
stages, or disease states. MicroRNA expression levels can be
studied using several different methods: Microarray analysis,
real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Northern blots, in
situ hybridization etc. Of these techniques, quantitative reverse
transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and Microarray are the most
sensitive and accurate methods. A crucial requirement in the
miRNA field is the development of precise methods for
quantification. Characterization of miRNA targets is insufficient

technical approaches that can be adopted in resolving these questions on
miRNA.

without understanding the stoichiometric relationship between a
specific miRNA and the copy number of its mRNA target(s).
This information will be particularly important in neurons, which
are highly polarized.
Even though genomic technologies are advanced, scientists
continue to build upon them to make these even better. Two
cutting-edge technologies in modern biology, microarrays and
Real Time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) are in the lead to
revolutionize biology and medicine. RNAi, a powerful new
approach for achieving targeted gene silencing using
siRNA/miRNA as the triggering agent, offers remarkable
specificity, scalability, potency, and reproducibility. MicroRNAs
can be a challenge to study because of their small size. They
require specialized and dedicated tools for analysis. For qRTPCR and microarray applications, the following are the
requirements:
1. Effective method of miRNA isolation from samples
2. RT-PCR and Microarray reagents optimized for miRNA
detection
3. Assays specific to the miRNAs of interest
4. Real-time and Microarray analytical instruments and
reagents validated for miRNA detection protocols

SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE

Samples should be processed immediately after collection –
tissue should be frozen, preferably in liquid nitrogen as small
pieces, or placed in RNAlater (an Ambion product) solution for
storage until RNA extraction is performed.
TOTAL RNA ISOLATION AND ENRICHING OF MICRORNA

MicroRNA can be isolated from total RNA that includes the
small RNA fraction from the samples of interest. However, not
all isolation methods retain the small RNA fraction. Therefore, it
is important to use RNA isolation methods specifically adapted
to retain it. Several companies have developed isolating kits to
retain these small RNA species either in a background of total
RNA or as an enriched fraction of RNA species of 70-200
nucleotides in size or smaller. Briefly, sample is collected in
RNA stabilization solution and treated with chloroform to
separate aqueous, organic and interphase. RNA partitions to the
upper, aqueous phase, while DNA partitions to the interphase
and proteins to the lower, organic phase or the interphase. The
upper, aqueous phase is extracted, and ethanol is added to
provide appropriate binding conditions for all RNA molecules
from 18 nucleotides upwards. The sample is then applied to the
RNeasy Mini spin column, where the total RNA binds to the
membrane and phenol and other contaminants are efficiently
washed away. High quality RNA is then eluted in RNase-free
water. For qRT-PCR and microarray detection of miRNA, total
RNA is usually sufficient, although enrichment of the small RNA
fraction can increase sensitivity in many applications.
QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF RNA

Purity, quantity and quality are the factors important for
successful gene expression analysis. RNA yield can be measured
by looking at the A260 reading using a spectrophotometer. A
reliable and inexpensive method to look at RNA quality is to run
the samples on a polyacrylamide gel.
MICROARRAY

Microarrays provide a snapshot of gene expression of all the
genes in a cell. A microarray works by exploiting the ability of a
given miRNA molecule to bind specifically to, or hybridize to,
the DNA template from which it originated. By using an array
containing many DNA samples, researchers can determine, in a
single experiment, the expression levels of hundreds or
thousands of genes within a cell by measuring the amount of
RNA bound to each site on the array. With the aid of a computer
using specific computational methods the amount of RNA bound
to the spots on the microarray is precisely measured, generating
a profile of gene expression in the cell. Using bioinformatics and
statistical tools, the data is interpreted for meaningful
information. The process of microarray based microRNA
profiling; initially developed by Liu et al60 involves four main
steps: target labeling, DNA-DNA hybridization, staining and
signal detection. MicroRNA microarray is a high-throughput
approach to study the expression of miRNAs in cultured cells or
tissues. Unlike the traditional cDNA microarray expression
profiling, RNA samples used for miRNA microarray
hybridization need to be enriched for small RNAs. Usually, the
first step of a miRNA microarray experiment is the isolation of

Volume 37, No. 2 – March 2010

total RNA and the enrichment or direct isolation of small RNA.
The miRNAs are then labeled and cleaned-up, following with
miRNA hybridization to arrays spotted with miRNA probes.
After washes and scanning, the differential miRNAs are
identified. Subsequent validation is recommended using
Northern blot, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR), or other analytical methods.
The recent development of highly efficient labeling methods
and novel microarray probe designs enable direct labeling of as
low as 120 ng of total RNA using Cy3 or Cy5, without
fractionation or amplification, to produce precise and accurate
measurements that span a linear dynamic range from 0.2 amol to
2 fmol of input miRNA. The assay is also applicable for
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples61.
REAL-TIME PCR ASSAY

A real-time PCR assay is a tool that can be used to quantify
differential gene expression. This type of assay measures
(quantifies) the amount of a nucleic acid target during each
amplification cycle of the PCR. The target may be DNA, cDNA,
or RNA. In the initial cycles of PCR, there is little change in
fluorescence signal. This defines the baseline for the
amplification plot. An increase in fluorescence above the
baseline indicates the detection of accumulated PCR product. A
fixed fluorescence threshold can be set above the baseline. The
parameter Ct (threshold cycle) is defined as the fractional cycle
number at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold.
Relative quantitation might be used to measure gene
expression in response to a chemical (drug) as an example. The
level of gene expression of a particular gene of interest in a
chemically treated sample would be compared relative to the
level of gene expression in an untreated sample. Another method
of looking at gene expression using qRT-PCR is to look at
absolute quantitation and standard curves made using a dilution
curve.
Real-time PCR can also be employed to quantify miRNA
expression profiles and study the potential function of miRNAs
in cancer pathogenesis. Real-time PCR was recently employed to
measure miRNA precursors and to study the expression of 23
miRNA precursors in six cell lines62. These PCR-based analyses
quantify miRNA precursors and not the active mature miRNAs.
The relationship between pri-miRNA and mature miRNA
expression has not been thoroughly addressed. This relationship
is critical in case real-time PCR analysis is carried out to study
the function of miRNAs.
PERSPECTIVE OF MIRNA RESEARCH

The genomic miRNA loci comprises of a host of completely
unexplored genes, each with its specific background. Annotating
these miRNAs with functional assignments, knockout or
knockdown techniques, establishing target fields specific
settings, and quantifying the miRNA interactome directing the
implementation of its function, promises to sustain this field for
some outcome.
Discovery of the role of miRNAs in various pathological
processes has opened up possible applications in molecular
diagnostics and prognostics. Some miRNAs are controlled by
epigenetic alterations in cancer cells, including DNA
181

THE CANADIAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES

methylation and histone modification. Using chromatin
modifying drugs to activate disease specific miRNAs can
regulate target genes, and it may lead to novel therapies in future.
MicroRNAs can complement other genomic and proteomic
biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. Although each miRNA
can control hundreds of target genes, it remains a great challenge
to identify the accurate miRNA targets for research.
MICRORNAS: FROM BENCH TO BEDSIDE

MicroRNAs provide a particular layer of network for gene
regulation of a broad spectrum of biological pathways through
fine-tuning protein expression levels. Aberrant cellular miRNAs
expression is causally associated with a variety of diseases
including neurodegenerative diseases. This implies that miRNAs
have great potential to be developed as a novel class of
therapeutic targets. To this end, methods for altering the levels of
miRNA expression have been adapted from existing gene
therapy and RNAi technologies, where synthetic siRNAs
molecules have been routinely used to inactivate gene expression
in mammalian cells. Specific knockdown of the target miRNAs
by anti-miRNA oligonucleotides, or overexpression of miRNA
duplex by transfection of vectors encoding this structure has
been conducted both in vitro and in vivo. Although research is
presently at the bench level, miRNAs are promising tools to be
translated into therapeutic agents in the future for tackling
diseases at the cellular miRNA level. In addition, although
siRNAs or shRNAs have been widely used as the gene-silencing
molecules, and even a few siRNAs are beginning to enter clinical
trials63, the intrinsic drawbacks of siRNA methodology have
been revealed, including the off-target effects, elicitation of the
interferon response, and interference of the endogenous miRNA
biogenesis64-67, all of which greatly hamper its therapeutic use.
However, compared to siRNA methodology, the unique
biogenesis and mechanism of miRNA action allow it to be
exempt from these problems. With the advantage of specificity
and toxicity and the attractive feature of multiple targeting
potential, miRNA can potentially become a great tool for gene
intervention.
Modified anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs), also
designated as “antagomirs”, are currently the most readily
available tools for miRNA inhibition68-72. As an approach firstly
adopted by Boutla and colleagues73, different types of modified
AMOs complementary to mature miRNAs have inhibited
specific endogenous miRNAs in various experimental models:
cell culture69,71-74, flies72,74-75, and mice72,76-77. Computer
program-assisted sequence predictions, in combination with
empirical efforts and more complete knowledge of miRNA
mechanisms, will promote the development of artificial
miRNAs.
CONCLUSION

Neurodegenerative diseases are the result of deterioration of
neurons, ultimately leading to disabilities and the possibility of
death. There are dozens of identified neurodegenerative diseases,
and research suggests that gene defects play a major role in
disease pathogenesis. Many such genetic studies have been
carried out in the Indian population, signifying the role genetic
polymorphisms play in neurodegenerative diseases. Such
182

genetic studies to date have provided valuable clues into the
etiology and pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases
from a molecular perspective, but there is significant work to be
done before a full picture can be obtained. Due to the lack of
comprehensive information on these diseases, cases thought to
be unique and devoid of inheritance, might eventually prove to
originate from specific genetic mutations or genetic risk factors.
Further, the possibility exists that there may be only a few
common genetic and mechanistic factors contributing to
neuronal cell death. Future studies examining the genetic basis of
neurodegeneration will truly be the key to gleaning information
for the design and development of early prediction, prevention,
and treatment options for addressing these diseases. The study of
miRNA is a novel approach to understand neurodegenerative
diseases. Recent studies have hinted at miRNA-linked
modulation of long-term neuron integrity in response to toxic
human disease proteins with neurodegenerative diseases.
Traditionally, miRNA expression has been tested using lowthroughput techniques such as Northern-blot analysis and realtime PCR, but new developments in microarray technology now
enable global profiling of all miRNA genes and their precursors
in any sample type.
Once ignored completely or overlooked as cellular detritus,
short snippets of RNA discovered only a little over a decade ago
are turning out to be crucial regulators of cell growth,
differentiation, and death. Rodriguez-Lebron and Paulson78
reviewed allele-specific RNA interference for neurological
diseases. It has been shown that suppression of toxic gene
expression through RNAi can be used for treatment of human
disease in general and the neurological disorders in particular.
The strategies used to achieve allele-specific silencing in light of
recent developments in the field of RNAi biology are being
reviewed. Especially, new insights into siRNA and miRNA
processing are discussed as a means to improve efficiency and
specificity of RNAi therapy. In addition, steps that can be taken
to maximize the therapeutic benefits of this powerful technology
have also been discussed.
MicroRNAs regulate multiple pathways in multiple tissues at
multiple stages. Emerging evidences suggest that miRNAs are
essential for the normal development of almost all animal
tissues22, including stem cells79-86, brain87-94 embryo95-98,
heart22,98-99, limb100, liver and other tissues22. Specific miRNAs
control specific tissue development at particular stages of
development22.
The concept of the expression signature of microRNAs as
representing a distinct and well defined experimental state that
can then be connected to an otherwise unrelated biological
system opens the way for a myriad of applications to
communicate and understand biological complexity. The ability
of an expression signature to connect two states, where the
expression signature is the intermediary, is exemplified in the
recent studies of Lamb et al, which describe a ‘Connectivity
Map’101. For example, the connection between miR-34s and p53,
has quickly shifted focus to answering one key question – Is
miR-34 sufficient and/or necessary for any of the biological
outcomes elicited by p53? However, two of the best studied p53
outputs; growth arrest and apoptosis have been proved102. The
potential of miRNAs to recognize many targets through
imperfect base pairing, the pleiotropic effects of putative

LE JOURNAL CANADIEN DES SCIENCES NEUROLOGIQUES

‘guardian of microRNAs: miR-34s’ may simply reflect the
different spectrum of target mRNAs available in a given system,
and this may represent a recurring theme within miRNAmediated regulatory pathways.
Numerous reports have demonstrated the role of miRNAs in
neural development. Evidence for a role in Parkinson’s and
Alzheimer's disease11 comes from animal model studies
published recently, showing that loss of miRNAs may be
involved in the development and progession of the disease. In
cell culture experiments, transfer of small RNA fragments
partially preserved miRNA deficient nerve cells.
There are umpteen numbers of ways of exploiting this area of
research for a variety of disorders in general and neurodegenerative disorders in specific. A lot of research has gone into
the impact of miRNAs in diseases like cancer, while it is still in
the rudimentary stages as far as the molecule’s role in the
nervous system disorders is concerned. It can evolve into an
effective diagnostic tool in identifying over-expression of
disease specific miRNA species in a specific neuronal disorder,
or conversely the under-expression of specific miRNAs involved
in protection against neurodegenerative conditions. In addition,
prognosis can be a promising option if researchers are able to
identify an abnormal proliferation of certain miRNA molecules
associated with pre-disease conditions. Although options can be
innumerable with these incredibly tiny but significant
micromolecules, a lot of research needs to be carried out by
narrowing the plethora of specificities, while still having the
broad perspective in mind.
