Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is considered as a high
prevalence neurodegenerative disorders worldwide.
Pathologically, the demise of dopamine-producing cells, in
large part due to an abnormal accumulation of the asynuclein in the substantia nigra, is one of the main causes
of the disease. Up until now, many de novo investigations
have been conducted to disclose the mechanisms underlying in PD. Among them, impacts of non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) on the pathogenesis and/or progression of PD
need to be highlighted. microRNAs (miRNAs) and long
ncRNAs (lncRNAs) are more noteworthy in this context.
miRNAs are small ncRNAs (with 18–25 nucleotide in
length) that control the expression of multiple genes at
post-transcriptional level, while lncRNAs have longer size
(over 200 nucleotides) and are involved in some key biological processes through various mechanisms. Involvement of miRNAs has been well documented in the
development of PD, particularly gene expression. Hence, in
this current review, we will discuss the impacts of miRNAs

Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the high prevalence
progressive neurodegenerative disorder just after Alzheimer worldwide, its symptoms can manifest as bradykinesia,
rigidity, resting tremor, and posture instability [1]. Mechanistically, degeneration of dopamine-producing cells,
because of an abnormal deposition of the a-synuclein
which bind to ubiquitin in the cells within substantia nigra,
seems to be one of the main causes of the disease [2, 3].
However, as the disease advances, the number of involved
brain regions (i.e., cingulate gyrus, amygdala and higher
cortical regions) is increased and causes of the emergence
of psychosis and dementia [4]. Lewy bodies, as typical
characteristic of PD, are cytoplasmic inclusions (as asynuclein-ubiquitin complex) that cannot be degraded by
proteasomes [5]. Newest researches on the pathogenesis of
disease have elucidated that the defect in protein trafficking
machineries, shuttle proteinaceous compounds between
two main cellular compartments—the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus—could be another underlying
mechanism for the death of dopaminergic neurons [6]. The
a-synuclein, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK-2), parkin
(PRKN/PARK2), phosphatase and tensin homologue
(PTEN)-induced kinase1 (PINK1/PARK6) and oncogene
DJ-1 are suspected to be participated in the initiation/development of PD [7]. Furthermore, some other genes such
as synuclein alpha polymorphism, glucoberebrosidase

Mol Biol Rep

(GBA), microtubule-associated protein, tau/saitohin
(MAPT/STH), appear to associate with the risk of PD
development/progression [8]. It should be noted that
approximately 1.5–2 % of the human genome are proteincoding region, while the remaining is transcribed into
transcripts with no protein-coding capacity that is known as
non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are believed to have a
critical regulatory activity in normal cellular development,
function, and pathogenesis of various diseases [9, 10]. As a
matter of fact, the importance of ncRNAs in the different
basic and translational researches and particularly in the
brain function and central nervous system (CNS) disorders
become a hot spot for researchers in neuro-regenerative
medicine. These RNA molecules are classified as small
ncRNAs and long ncRNAs as fewer as and longer than 400
nucleotides in size, respectively. Small ncRNAs per se
comprise microRNAs (miRNAs; 19-24 bp), PIWI interacting RNAs (piRNAs; 26–31 bp), transcription initiation
RNAs (tiRNAs; 17–18 bp), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs; 60–300 bp), promoter-associated small RNAs
(PASRs; 22–200 bp), and TSS-associated RNAs (TSSaRNAs; 20–90 bp). Long ncRNAs are comprised of transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs; [200 bp) and
large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs; [200 bp)
[11–14]. Increasing evidence has clearly emphasized the
crucial roles of ncRNAs in multiple biological processes
(e.g., brain development and differentiation), and various
diseases (e.g., neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, and spinocerebellar
ataxia diseases) [15]. Here, we aimed to provide a brief
introduction about structure and biosynthesis of some
important ncRNAs, the molecular mechanisms and main
functions of these macromolecules, and finally the major
involvements of ncRNAs in neurodegenerative diseases, in
particular, Parkinson’s disease.

Non coding RNAs: a brave new RNA world
From their broad biology and function viewpoints, miRNAs are known as the most researched group of ncRNAs
[16]. Since their discovery in Caenorhabditis elegans
almost 20 years ago by Lee et al. [17], miRNAs are touted
as one of the extensively studied classes of small ncRNAs.
These macromolecular biomolecules are classified as a
conserved class of short and single-stranded RNA molecules with a size of about 22 nucleotides, which has a
pivotal function in ‘‘fine-tuning’’ gene expression, mediating through the interaction with DNA, RNA and protein
molecules [9, 18]. Calling attention, more miRNA
sequences analysis comes to the realization that a wonderful nearly 30 % of them are unique to primates, and
even a few, such as miR-941, may be unique to humans

123

[19]. They are thought to underlie phenotypic variation
between species, possibly at the foundation of unique
human traits [20].
LncRNAs have a unique function in various substantial
parts of stem cell biology, epigenetics, cancer, signaling
and neurobiology [21–23]. This group of RNAs is comprised of a broad portion of the transcriptome, such that
over 18,000 transcripts are presently annotated as lncRNAs
and a large number of new lncRNAs are discovered each
year [24, 25]. By definition, lncRNAs have over 200
nucleotides in size and do not encode proteins with
exceeding lengths of more than 30 amino acids [26, 27].
Generally, this group is less conserved between species and
often shows high tissue specificity and low expression
levels [25, 28]. Therefore, once discovered, lncRNAs have
been referred as ‘‘transcriptional noise’’ [29]. However,
increasing studies showed that lncRNAs play significant
functions in many aspects of genome function such as,
gene transcription, modulating RNA polymerase II function, regulating splicing, and epigenetics [30]. Although a
huge amount of the human noncoding transcriptome is
occupied by lncRNAs; to illustrate the diversity among the
lncRNAs, here we discuss their classification, focusing on
four classes, including (a) long intergenic ncRNAs
(lincRNA), (b) natural antisense transcripts (NAT), (c) 30 UTR-associated transcripts (uaRNA), and (d) enhancer
RNAs (eRNA).

Biosynthesis of ncRNAs
miRNAs
It has been proposed that there are two distinct biosynthesis
pathways for small ncRNAs which are divided into multiple steps [31]. At the first step of canonical or Drosha-/
Dicer-dependent biosynthesis pathway, RNA polymerase II
transcribes primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) from two target
genomic loci: miRNA genes or the introns of proteincoding mRNAs [32]. The generated pri-miRNAs, which
fold into secondary structures comprised of base-paired
stem loops, can subsequently be polyadenylated and regulated by the transcription factors. Next, the pri-miRNAs
are cleaved into about 70-nucleotide premature-miRNAs
(the so-called pre-miRNAs) containing hairpin structures in
the nucleus by Drosha/DGCR8 complex - a RNase III type
endonuclease microprocess [33]. The next step is the traverse of pre-miRNAs into the cytoplasmic space across the
nuclear membrane governing by Exportin-5 via a RanGTP-mediated mechanism. Once inside the cytoplasm, the
pre-miRNAs are further cleaved into RNA duplexes of 22
nucleotide by complex of Dicer- a second RNase III-type
enzyme- and TAR RNA-binding protein 2. The RNA

Mol Biol Rep

duplexes bind to a protein of 182 kDa with glycine-tryptophan repeat and argonaute proteins, AGO1-4, resulting in
formation of the miRNA-induced silencing complex
(RISC) [34, 35]. Notably, the mature guide strand (20–22
nucleotides in length) remains in association with RISC.
This strand is also referred as miRNA-5p [36]. The other
anti-sense strand, known as passenger miRNA (the socalled miRNA-3p, and is a complementary star-form
miRNA, miRNA*) is released from RISC. The first thought
was that the antisense strand is degraded in the cytoplasm;
however, recently, a number of studies showed that some
of them may have biological importance [37].
Subsequently, the mature miRNA exerts its biological
function(s) via aligning the RISC to complementary
sequences in the 30 UTR of target mRNA [38, 39]. This
association, most commonly, represses the translation of
target proteins and recruits some protein complexes contributed in deadenylation and degradation of related target
mRNA and finally, as a consequence, down regulation in
gene expression [40].
Alternatively, the non-canonical pathway, also termed
as Drosha-independent/Dicer-dependent pathway, premiRNAs bypass the Drosha/DGCR8 complex and is processed by AGO2 to the mature guide strand. The RNA

product of this pathway is very short introns that are often
referred as mirtrons. As shown in Fig. 1, following
translocation to the cytoplasm from the nucleus, mirtrons
act similarly to miRNA produced from the canonical
pathway [41].
In the case of lncRNAs, it is suggested that these RNA
molecules can be produced by RNA polymerase II,
polyadenylated (polyA), even capped, or spliced. lncRNAs
can be transcribed from intergenic regions; and in overlapping, antisense, intronic and bidirectional orientations
(in comparison with protein-coding genes) from gene
regulatory regions as well as specific chromosomal regions
[42]. In the following context, we will briefly discuss some
structural and biosynthetic features of four distinct
lncRNAs.
lincRNAs
Thousands of lincRNAs transcripts have been identified in
mammalian genomes, including approximately 3300 ones
from six human cell types [24]. Predominately, RNA
polymerase II transcribes lincRNAs and generates
polyadenylated RNAs ranging in length from 2000 to
20,000 nucleo-tides, and a significant fraction is

multiexonic, producing alternatively spliced variants [43].
lncRNA’s genes contain known chromatin signatures,
including trimethyation of Lys 36 of histone 3
(H3K36me3) along with their tran-scribed region and
trimethyation of Lys 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3) at promoters. These RNA molecules have some characteristic
features [44], such as possessing a lower expression level,
being readily detectable, displaying a more tissue-specific
pattern, and having a greater conservation rate in sequences
together with the patches of higher conservation [45].
NATs
The ncRNA molecules are transcribed from the opposite
strand of target genes, originating from protein or nonprotein coding genes [46]. In comparison with lincRNAs,
NATs are considered as an abundant class of lncRNAs,
approximately 70 % of mouse genes, which transcribe in
an antisense manner to form sense/antisense pairs of coding and non-coding RNAs [24, 47]. Although, both the 50
and 30 regions of protein-coding genes can be a target for
antisense transcription [48]. However, it should be noted
that, unlike lincRNAs, NATs show very little sequence
conservation [49].
uaRNAs
A large number of uaRNAs molecules have been recognized in mouse and humans by the analysis of gene
expression and cDNA libraries. Normally, RNA polymerase II–dependent transcriptional start sites have a 50
cap, nevertheless, uaRNAs do not seem to be independently transcribed [50]. Since, these RNAs lack specific
chromatin marks, it is deemed that they are indicative of
transcriptional start sites and are not enriched for RNA
polymerase II occupancy. Instead, uaRNAs seem to be
derived from cleavage of the full-length transcript [51].
eRNAs
Generally, enhancers are regulatory DNA elements which
are settled distally from transcription start sites, contain
unique histone modifications, and recruiting and depositing
transcription factors [52–54]. In fact, eRNAs are lncRNAs
with short-life span and approximately 2 kb in length,
which are transcribed bi-directionally by RNA polymerase
II due to the recruitment of enzyme by enhancer regions in
an activity-dependent manner. They have various species,
and accordingly about 2000 in mouse and 3000 in humans
had so far been identified through multiple studies. Accumulating studies and some special experimental techniques
have shown that eRNAs are not polyadenylated and
actively involved in promoting mRNA synthesis [55, 56].

Molecular mechanisms and function of ncRNA
miRNAs
Of the ncRNAs, miRNAs play certain roles in the control of
multiple processes, including differentiation, proliferation,
development and apoptosis [57, 58]. There are several
described mechanisms of miRNA action, including
(a) mRNA cleavage, (b) cap-40S initiation blockage, (c) 60S
ribosomal unit connecting inhibition, (d) elongation inhibition, (e) ribosome premature termination, (f) co-translational
protein degradation, (g) decomposition in P-bodies,
(h) mRNA destabilization and (j) gene silencing [59, 60].
As main mechanisms, mRNA cleavage or translational
repression are two post-transcriptional mechanisms by
which miRNAs in complex with RISC can reduce the
expression levels of genes. If the miRNA in combination
with cytoplasmic RISC has adequate complementarity to
the mRNA (usually to 30 UTR), miRNA will determine the
cleavage process [61–63]. If the mRNA does not have
enough complimentarily to be degraded, but does have an
appropriate constellation of miRNA complementary sites,
miRNA will inhibit productive translation [64]. After this
process, the miRNA remains unscathed and can guide the
recognition and degradation of other targets. Another
possible mechanism is that the recent synthesized
polypeptide is specifically destructed after translation
[65, 66]. In short, despite conduction of several studies on
the mode of action of miRNAs, their mediated gene regulation still holds some secrets that need to be disclosed by
future biochemical, molecular, and cellular investigation.

LncRNAs
As another class of ncRNA, lncRNAs impose pivotal roles
in various aspects of biology [67]. Although the number of
well characterized lncRNAs is not too many, until now,
they have been confirmed to control the gene expression at
various levels [68, 69]. Indeed, they have been implicated
in transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, gene regulation in post-transcription level, alternative splicing, and
in gene silencing [69, 70]. Different RNAs recruit multiple
mechanisms that result in different regulatory outcomes.
Despite structurally differences found between various
classes of lncRNA, there are similarities in their mode of
function(s).
LncRNAs have the capability to respond to disparate
stimuli by eliciting substantial transcriptional controlling
mechanism that regulates their expression. As a result,
lncRNAs can act as molecular signals, because particular
lncRNAs can be transcribed at a very distinctive time and
place to merge developmental cues and explicate

Mol Biol Rep

responding against several stimuli. It should be pointed out
that some lncRNAs encompass regulatory functions,
whereas others are exclusively products of transcription
[24, 44].
LncRNAs have a central function in positively and negatively regulation of transcription, in large part due to the
comprehensive transcription of enhancers and promoters by
lncRNAs. Action as a molecular decoy is one of the diverse
mechanisms by which lncRNAs may control transcription.
After transcription of this type of lncRNA, it binds to a
protein target and evaluates it, but does not apply any further
functions. Then, the RNAs can exert their function through
being as a ‘‘molecular sink’’ for RNA-binding proteins [71].
On the other hand, lncRNAs can bind protein(s), and then
direct the ribonucleoprotein complex to particular targets. As
discussed above, lncRNAs can exert alternations in gene
expression in cis/trans manner that is not readily predicted
from lncRNA sequence information. Numerous specific and
likely prevalent functions of these RNA molecules in transcriptional regulation dictate somewhat exigency that a
given local alteration in chromatin structure has not only
local results, and may impose structural counteraction at a
distance region [72–74].
In addition, lncRNAs can act as central platforms for
assembling of several related molecular components in
many various biological signaling events, which is deemed
to be the characteristic of exact control by these RNA
molecules, and is necessary to the accurate modification of
the dynamics and specificity of signaling pathways and
interactions between molecules [75, 76].

Roles of ncRNAs in brain health
and neurodegenerative diseases
Of the ncRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs have rapidly been
the center of research interests both in multiple basic fields
of biology and translational medicine. These biomolecules
have been demonstrated to impose diverse roles in different
functions within brain as well as CNS disorders. Despite
special attention to this topic, there are surprisingly some
inadequacies for the accessible research technique and
experimental protocols to disclose these macromolecular
biomolecules impacts in brain functions in health and
diseased conditions. Accordingly, we will provide brief yet
focused insights on the miRNAs and lncRNA functions in
modulating the multi-leveled activities within brain and
neurodegenerative diseases, in particular, PD.

cellular homeostasis, moderate stress responses, and to
modify numerous parameters related to the synaptic plasticity [77–81]. Actually, a range of miRNAs are only limited
to human and have a brain-specific expression pattern. These
RNA molecules can promote the integrity of specific differentiated neural phenotypes by inhibiting the expression of
genes affecting the maintenance of the undifferentiated
neural cell state. Subsequently, some changes in the
expression mode of miRNAs may initiate the dedifferentiation and cellular transformation [82, 83]. However, it suggested that human brain-specific miRNA genes are not
necessarily related to human special cognitive function,
since these miRNA molecules have low expression levels
and few conserved targets [84]. A recent study found a
human brain-specific miRNA, miR-941, whose target genes
are contributed in neurotransmitter signaling [19]. Another
human brain-enriched and primate-specific miRNA termed
miR-1202, which has been reported to be associated with the
pathophysiology of depression [85].
One of the well- studied subgroups of miRNA targets
comprises transcripts encoding synapse-related proteins
such as synaptotagmin, synapsin 1, and the fragile-X
mental retardation protein (FMRP) [86]. Myriad studies
showed that during the crucial phases of memory formation, miRNAs positively exert their functions in synaptic
tagging to confirm synaptic input specificity [87–89]. In the
dendritic spines, miRNAs can interact with the cellular
machinery in a reversible manner to generate long-term
alternations in synaptic function. In response to synaptic
activity, alternation in the RISC or conformational changes
in dendritic mRNAs implicating availability to their 30
UTRs induced miRNA-mediated silencing [90, 91] [92].
LncRNAs
The expression of LncRNAs is also high in various parts of
the CNS, so that in a study of 1328 lncRNAs examined 849
cases were found to be expressed within the mouse brain
[28]. In addition, it has been confirmed that lncRNAs are
expressed across various regions within the brain [93].
Recently, huge numbers of studies have reported that
lncRNAs possess main function in spatial–temporal modulation of gene expression involved in the brain development.
Given that the CNS is one of the most intricate biological
systems, it encompasses an enormous array of neuronal.

Parkinson’s disease: molecular mechanisms
and etiology

miRNAs
The expression level of miRNAs is very high within the
mature and non-mature brain. They are able to increase the

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is defined with some pathological
hallmarks such as the progressive death of dopaminergic
neurons, which contains apparent amounts of neuromelanin

123

Mol Biol Rep

in a midbrain structure, so-called the substantia nigra pars
compacta (SNpc), and the presence of intraneuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, Lewy bodies [94]. These inclusions are
made from neurofilaments and ubiquitin. Lewy bodies are
also found in the peripheral nervous system of PD patients
[95]. The motor symptoms, particularly akinesia, are
caused by intense dopamine depletion in the striatum.
Despite the increasing number of studies about the etiology
of parkinsonian degeneration, the exact phenomena
underlying such a degeneration process is yet to be fully
defined [95, 96]. It should be stated that the dopaminergic
neurons in the substantia nigra are more susceptible to
degeneration. Some data supporting such findings are
based on the high levels of reactive oxygen species, nonenzymatic auto-oxidation of dopamine which generates
neuromelanin, and decrease in cells synthesizing glutathion
peroxidase [97, 98]. Apparently, oxidative stress is one of
the key causes of the nigral degeneration. The increase in
ROS production during the degeneration of substantia nigra
is caused by two major biochemical phenomena, (a) elevation in iron level possibly because of reduction of cellular ferritin and an increase in expression of lactoferrin
receptor. This situation can result in an increased generation of ROS due to the auto-oxidation of neuromelanin
[99, 100], and (b) reduction in antioxidant defense level.
An increase in the dopamine turnover rates can cause a rise
in basal generation of hydrogen peroxide, which in turn
depletes the glutathione reservoirs [101].
Mitochondrial impairment, especially defect in complex
I (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide coenzyme Q reductase) of the respiratory chain appears to be another possible
mechanism for Parkinsonian degeneration. No matter what
the nature of the mitochondrial impairment is, it may
eventually cause a marked drop in ATP levels and a defect
in proton pumping. As a result, the mitochondrial membrane potential can be decreased, and cell can undergo the
apoptosis [102].

Parkinson’s diseases related genes
Although there are 28 discrete chromosomal loci shown to
be related to PD, only six of them have been illustrated to
cause heritable monogenic PD, including a-synuclein
(PARK1/PARK4), Parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), DJ1 (PARK7), LRRK2 (PARK8), and ATP13A2 (PARK9)
[103]. Of these, a-synuclein is one of the most important
genes with a definitive role in the pathogenesis of PD.
Some significant genetic alternations in this gene are
included point mutations, duplications, and triplications
result in the death of dopamine neurons due to a-synuclein
aggregation and accumulation in fibrillar form and neurotoxicity. a-synuclein is a prominent component of Lewy

123

bodies. A dose–response relevance of a-synuclein gene has
been reported to associate with the development of PD at
an earlier age and its elevation is directly related to
dementia severity [104, 105]. Moreover, mutation in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has been known as the
most prevalent cause of dominantly inherited PD and is a
risk factor for sporadic PD. Recent accumulating studies
suggested that LRRK2 may be involved in membrane
trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics, but its certain normal function has not been clearly described. LRRK2 has
been suggested to deteriorate in the PD pathogenesis via a
gain-of-function mechanism. Actually, a glycine to serine
substitution, at position 2019 (G2019S) of LRRK2, results
in an elevated activity of the activation loop of the kinase
domain. The finding that LRRK2 inhibition suppresses
neurotoxicity provides further support for the gain-offunction mechanism [106–108]. Another important PDrelated gene, DJ-1, is a multifunctional protein that is
associated with different cellular processes including the
transcriptional regulation, cellular transformation, antioxidative stress reaction, chaperone, protease, and mitochondrial regulation. Further, oxidation of DJ-1, which
causes inactivation of DJ-1, has been seen in patients with
sporadic PD, revealing that DJ-1 also takes part in the onset
and pathogenesis of the familial and sporadic PD [109].
Another causative gene for an autosomal recessive form of
PD is Paskin, an ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). Parkin is a
component of the ubiquitin system and major adenosine
triphosphate-dependent protein degradation machinery. It
encodes a protein in an incomparable structure with a
ubiquitin-like domain in the N-terminal and a RING finger
motif in the C-terminal. Furthermore, it has been shown
that CDCrel-1, a synaptic vesicle associated protein is a
substrate for Parkin. In fact, several deletion and point
mutations have been detected in patients with autosomal
recessive PD. The substantia nigra and the locus coeruleus
optionally undergo neurodegeneration without producing
Lewy bodies [110, 111]. Mutations of the mitochondrial
PINK1 appear to be another reason for the recessive PD.
Studies on loss of function and overexpression revealed
that PINK1 plays a significant role in apoptosis, abnormal
mitochondrial morphology, impaired dopamine release and
motor deficits. However, the basic mechanism underlying
these different phenotypes remains to be elucidated. It has
been shown that PINK1 deficiency or clinical mutations
may affect the function of Complex I of the mitochondrial
respiratory chain, resulting in mitochondrial depolarization
and an elevated sensitivity to apoptosis. Therefore, multiple studies have suggested that Complex I deficiency
underlies, at least partially, in the pathogenesis of hereditary form of PD [112, 113]. Finally, Human ATP13A2, a
lysosomal P-type ATPase, has been shown to be related
with autosomal recessive PD. The protein coded by

Mol Biol Rep

ATP13A2 has a highly neurons-specific expression pattern
and acts as a cation pump, but the substrate specificity is
uncertain. Among the several genes involved in familial
forms of PD, the ATP13A2 gene may display the first
genetic link between PD pathogenesis and lysosomal
pathways. Impairment in the lysosomal targeting of
ATP13A2 is caused by missense or truncation mutations in
the related gene. As a consequence, lysosomes encounter
with a ATP13A2 deficiency because of the retention of
mutant ATP13A2 in the endoplasmic reticulum cisterna
[114, 115].

The impacts of miRNAs on Parkinson’ s disease
Because of the highlighted importance of miRNAs in
pathogenesis of brain diseases, various studies have been
conducted to clarify either direct or indirect roles of
miRNAs in PD. Evidence for a direct or indirect function(s) of miRNAs in the pathophysiology of PD is now
accumulating. One of the first investigations of a role for
miRNAs in the maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic
neurons was reported by Kim et al. [116]. Deletion of Dicer
in embryonic stem cells when post-mitotic Dopaminergic
neurons first arise resulted in complete loss of the
dopaminergic neurons, while the generation of other
mature neuronal classes was less affected. More important,
the phenotype was rescued by transfection of miRNA. It
has been demonstrated that several genes related to PD can
be affected by miRNAs. Of these genes, the functional
expression of a-synuclein is modulated by miR-153 and
miR-7 which bind directly to the 3́UTR of a-synuclein.
Further investigations reported other miRNAs can be
involved in initiation and/or development of PD [117, 118].
For example, increased levels of fibroblast growth factor 20
(FGF20) gene also resulted in overexpression of a-synuclein and hence loss of dopaminergic neurons. Binding of
miR-433 to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the
promoter region of FGF20 was shown to interrupt the
target site for miR-433, causing the overexpression of asynuclein [119]. In one of the first works investigating
miRNAs involved in the pathology of PD, about six
miRNAs were identified, including miR-1, miR-22*, and
miR-29a (decreased levels in untreated patients in comparison with healthy controls), and miR-16-2*, miR-26a2*, and miR-30a (increased levels in treated patients in
comparison with untreated ones). It is worthy of mentioning that all of these miRNA molecules can be indirectly
associated with the acting of a-synuclein. Of note, miR-30a
and miR-1 were implicated in regulation of dopamine
transport [120]. Valadi et al. investigated the miRNA
expression in blood leukocytes of PD patients pre- and
post-deep brain stimulation (DBS) by using the

combination of exon microarray technologies and small
RNA-seq. They compared the pattern of obtained miRNA
with parallel healthy controls [121]. A set of five miRNAs
(miR-4293, miR-378c, miR-18b*, miR-20a, and miR1249) that are under-expressed in PD versus DBS has
inversed/higher expression in controls when compared with
PD, suggesting both treatment and disease-related changes
in miRNA expression. Interestingly, down-regulation of
miR-29a, miR-29c, miR-30c, and miR-19b can also be
observed in white blood cells of PD DBS-off versus DBson patients and/or in the serum of PD versus control.
miRNA profiles in PD patients plasma samples have also
been reported. In a study by Cardo et al. qRT-PCR analysis
was performed in 25 controls and 31 patients after the onset
of symptoms; they found only one significantly up-regulated
miRNA, miR-331-5p. Another study identified miR-450b3p, miR-1826, miR-505, and miR-626 in PD patients [122].
Soreq et al. identified 16 miRNAs altered in PD patients in
comparison with healthy controls. They revealed that miR20a, miR-16, and miR-320 presented in blood leukocytes
[123]. As the development of circulating biomarkers for PD
detection has great importance, hence, finding measurable
molecular biomarkers can be potential clinical tools to
facilitate early PD diagnosis. In the case of using of different
protein biomarkers, there are some problems such as invasiveness and conflicting results among CSF proteins due to
assay differences and/or blood contamination. Therefore, it
is essential for detecting alternative biomarkers with high
rate of efficacy and safety [124]. As above-mentioned,
miRNAs open new opportunities for prognostic, diagnostic,
and therapeutic interventions during PD onset.
LRRK2 as the most fundamental gene in PD pathophysiology negatively controls Let-7 and miR-184 in the
dopamine generating cells. It initiates the overexpression of
E2F1 and DP, resulting in inevitable defects in cell proliferation capacity and promoting cell death [125]. The
miR-133b, a dopaminergic neuron-specific miRNA was
reported to generate a negative feedback loop with the
transcription factor PITX3 in midbrain dopamine producing neurons. Downregulation of miR-133b plays an
important neuroprotective role [116]. miR-205, as another
miRNA that regulates LRRK2, has significantly lower
levels in the frontal cortex and striatum of PD patients. In
murine models, the inhibition of miR-205 was reported to
impose upregulation of LRRK2 protein expression [126].
Further investigations have been centralized on the other
PD-related genes, when meaningful relationships have
been found that exist with miRNAs. In one of these studies,
it was revealed that DJ-1 and Parkin are respectively
controlled by miR-34b and miR-34c, respectively. These
miRNAs were downregulated at advanced stages of PD.
Furthermore, decrease in dopamine signaling in the
striatum may involve to up-regulate acetylcholine esterase

Mol Biol Rep

(AChE), because an acetylcholine imbalance promotes the
death of dopaminergic neurons [127]. miR-132 is an
important molecule that negatively regulates dopamine
neuron differentiation. Yang et al. [128] previously reported that the inhibition of miR-132 significantly increases
differentiation of dopamine neurons, whereas prolific
expression of miR-132 in the embryonic stem cells dramatically represses dopamine neuron differentiation. It also
has been found that miR-132 inhibits AChE, demonstrating
a neuro-protective role in dopaminergic neurons [129].
A brain-enriched miRNA, miR-124, was reported to play
a critical role in the neuronal differentiation during the CNS
development. Kanagaraj et al. [130] showed a reduction in
the expression miR-124 in the substantia nigra of the
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. Further, in vitro study revealed a
decrease in the expression levels of miR-124 in MN9D
dopaminergic neurons treated with MPP iodide. Gong et al.
[131] reported that miR-124 suppression increased neuronal
autophagy and apoptosis by regulating the AMPK/mTOR
signaling pathway in PD. In addition, miR-124 is downregulated in MPTP-treated PD cells, indicating its role on the
induction of neurons apoptosis and autophagy. In addition to
its possible role in PD, the integrated interplay between miR124 and glucocorticoids seems to be important [132]. In
response to the induction of miR-124 by glucocorticoids,
miRNA can directly interact with the 30 -UTR of glucocorticoids receptor-a mRNA to inhibit the expression of glucocorticoids receptor a and decrease the anti-inflammatory
effects of glucocorticoids [133].
On the other hand, previous studies unveiled that the
deregulation of glucocorticoid receptor and function are
possibly substantial in the degeneration of dopamine neurons through the establishment of chronic inflammation
[134].
Many of these studies, which have been conducted
recently, provide important evidence that dysregulated
miRNA acts as an essential molecular trigger in the
pathogenesis of PD [135]. The list of miRNAs involved in
PD become longer every year, and discussion about all
these miRNAs is out of the scope of this review.

expression levels were increased in the disease and inversely reduce following DBS. The candidate lncRNAs
include the spliceosome component U1, which support the
idea that splicing modulations is involved in diseases.
Additionally, elevated levels of the muscular dystrophyassociated RP11-462G22.1 (lnc-FRG1-3) may be related to
the muscle rigidity in PD, since routinely is screened as one
of the six disease indications of motor symptoms. Another
disease-altered lncRNAs, post-DBS (RP11-79P5.3), was
also detected as differentially expressed by analysis of an
additional external, independent PD brain RNA-Seq dataset. Based upon their findings, the authors concluded that
lncRNAs may be the exquisite biomarkers for PD and other
neurodegenerative diseases and a considerable mean in
future personalized neurology. In 2015, in a new study was
conducted by Carrieri et al. [137] to study the involvement
of antisense lncRNAs in PD based on assumption that
antisense transcription can regulate sense gene expression
functioning at distinct regulatory levels. These researchers,
in a previous study, identified AS Uchl1 as an antisense to
the mouse Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1
(Uchl1) gene (AS Uchl1), the synthetic locus of UCHL1/
PARK5. It should be highlighted that UCHL1/PARK5 one
of the 28 genes involved in PD- is mutated in rare cases of
early-onset familial PD. More important, manipulation of
UchL1 expression has been proposed as a tool for therapeutic intervention. AS Uchl1 enhances UchL1 translation
and expression and is the indicative member of SINEUPs
(SINEB2 sequence to upregulate translation) from a new
functional group of NATs. It was shown that Nurr1, a key
transcription factor implicated in dopaminergic cells’ differentiation and maintenance, controls the functional
expression of AS Uchl1. Moreover, AS Uch1 RNA levels
are significantly down regulated in neurochemical models
of PD in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, AS Uchl1 RNA is a
part of Nurr1-dependent gene network and a target of
cellular stress, which can extend our understanding of the
role of AS transcription in the brain. Taken together, since
elevating evidence indicated that increase expression levels
of Uchl1 could be advantageous in neurodegenerative
diseases, the application of AS Uchl1 as RNA-based drugs
may display a novel therapeutic strategy.

LncRNAs: new target for PD research
Conclusion
In 2014, for the first time, Soreq et al. [136] utilized a
whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing, consisting general
RNA-Seq analysis techniques, to determine all the transcripts that code proteins in leukocyte and lncRNAs in the
control group as well as PD patients. They recognized a
decreased lncRNA expression and selective PD-induced
alternation in 13 of over 6000 detected leukocyte lncRNAs.
These researchers also found five lncRNAs that their

Detection and analysis of ncRNAs, which appear to control
the gene expression, will provide a better understanding of
the molecular mechanisms, particularly in the nervous
system. However, the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases is yet to be fully understood. Such
information may favor the development of diagnostics and
treatment of severe human disorders including, PD.

Mol Biol Rep

Therefore, it is suggested that the general synthetic pathways and classification of ncRNAs and the possible
mechanism of ncRNAs involved in PD need to be clarified
towards the roles of two classes of ncRNAs, i.e., miRNA
and lncRNA. These ncRNAs seem to play pivotal roles can
be implicated in the unusual deposition of a-synuclein and
affect other PD-related genes. Further, ncRNAs are particularly important for their roles in normal development
and function of the CNS and the CNS-related disorders.
They are implicated in targeted gene expression and
function as major modulators in various neuroprotective
pathways. Changes in the patterns of miRNA and presumably lncRNA expression will probably act as diagnostic indication of brain function, and the pathology of
neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.
Further research seems to be necessary in ncRNA expression patterns and profiling, which may result in discovery
of many different modern biomarkers. Profound studies
need to be capitalized on identifying the function of
lncRNAs in RNA-mediated gene control is likely to remain
an area of extreme research interest. However, it opens a
new horizon in the human genomic studies towards clarification of the transcriptional complexity of the human
brain and potentially novel ways in the regulatory network
governing PD pathogenesis.

Future perspectives
A pivotal challenge in targeting lncRNAs in different milieu
is that they have potency to elicit off-target interactions and
recognize unexpected targets when added to different cells or
tissues [138]. However, it is recently acclaimed that any
manipulation or chemical modification can tailor their
affinity to intended effects, reduce toxicity rate and contribute to improved pharmacokinetic properties [139]. In
addition, the determination of alternative hypotheses to
pinpoint interesting results, assessment of several negative
controls, calculating the copy number of the RNA target per
cell, designing independent experimental approaches and
establishment of independent empirical approaches could
ameliorate their side effects [138].
Commensurate with these findings, emerging computational models and reliable instruments can help us to
decrease the time and overall cost of biological trials by
calculating the inherent association probability of candidate lncRNA-disease pair and confirming most favorable
lncRNA-disease pairs with high scores related to ongoing
biological experimental validation. Further investigation in
the development of computational models by combining
multiple biological datasets have no doubt to increase our
understanding of the disease-related lncRNAs in health and
disease. It also will remarkably benefit the introduction of

lncRNA therapeutic strategies aimed at the modulation of
uncontrolled aberrancies [140].
