Epigenetic Mechanisms in
Inflammation

J Dent Res 90(1):9-17, 2011

Abstract

Introduction

Epigenetic modifications occur in response to
environmental changes and play a fundamental
role in gene expression following environmental
stimuli. Major epigenetic events include methylation and acetylation of histones and regulatory
factors, DNA methylation, and small non-coding
RNAs. Diet, pollution, infections, and other environmental factors have profound effects on epigenetic modifications and trigger susceptibility to
diseases. Despite a growing body of literature
addressing the role of the environment on gene
expression, very little is known about the epigenetic pathways involved in the modulation of
inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes. This
review summarizes the current knowledge about
epigenetic control mechanisms during the inflammatory response.

pigenetics is defined as the study of mitotically and meiotically heritable changes in gene function that are not dependent on DNA sequence
(Feinberg, 2007). The molecular basis of epigenetic processes is complex and
involves modifications of histones, methylation of DNA, positioning of histone variants, and gene regulation by non-coding RNAs. Epigenetic modifications are potentially reversible, and, therefore, a thorough understanding of
these changes may identify new therapeutic targets for disease.
The epigenome, the overall epigenetic state of an organism, is just as
important as the genome to normal development. Importantly, environmental
factors (nutrients, toxins, infections, hypoxia) can have profound effects on
the epigenetic signature (Fig. 1) and trigger susceptibility to disease (Barros
and Offenbacher, 2009; Safronova and Morita, 2010). For example, recent
studies have shown that the fetal environment can cause changes in the epigenome, with long-term consequences for gene regulation and age-related
diseases (Thompson and Einstein, 2010). The studies by Bobetsis et al. (2006)
showed that periodontal infection can lead to placental-fetal exposure and,
when coupled with a fetal inflammatory response, leads to preterm delivery.

Inflammation
Inflammation is a complex physiological response of an organism to harmful
stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. In acute inflammation,
the initial response of the body to a stimulus is achieved by increasing the
migration of leukocytes and plasma from the blood to the injured areas. When
inflammation has a slow onset and persists for a long period of time, it
becomes chronic. The symptoms in chronic inflammation are not as severe as
in acute inflammation, but the condition is persistent. Chronic inflammation
underlies many diseases, including periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus
(Dunning, 2009).
The complexity of the inflammatory response requires the development of
a sophisticated regulatory network to carry out functions at signal-specific
and gene-specific levels (Medzhitov and Horng, 2009). This network involves
the activation of specific genes for antimicrobial defense, immune response,
and tissue repair and remodeling (Medzhitov, 2008). Macrophages play critical roles in diverse chronic diseases, including cancer and allergic responses,
and analysis of recent data indicates that chromatin modifications are mechanistically important in the acquisition of the macrophage phenotype (Khansari
et al., 2009). Transcription factors of the NF-κB, FOXP3, IRF, and STAT
families along with epigenetic phenomena, including DNA methylation and
covalent histone modifications, have been shown to be critical in the regulation of inflammatory genes (Medzhitov and Horng, 2009). In addition, several
of these regulatory factors are controlled by epigenetic mechanisms in T-cells
and monocytes (Lal et al., 2009; Wells, 2009; Wierda et al., 2010).

by promoting gene repression. Histone methylation, in contrast,
can keep chromatin in either an activated or a repressed state.
Tri-methylation of histone H3 on lysine 4 and 36 (H3K4me3
and H3K36me3) facilitates an open chromatin for active transcription (Barski et al., 2007). By contrast, histone methylations
on lysines 9 and 27 (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3) are generally
associated with a condensed chromatin and gene silencing (Lan
and Shi, 2009). Genes with bivalent modification (H3K4me3
and H3K27me3) are typically important developmental regulators in pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells or multipotent
progenitor cells which are silenced, but are poised for activation,
as differentiation proceeds (Bernstein et al., 2006; Mikkelsen
et al., 2007). Enhancers, which determine tissue-specific gene
expression, are marked by histone H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1) and by the histone acetyltransferase co-factors
CBP/p300 binding (Heintzman et al., 2007; Visel et al., 2009).
Methylation of histones is carried out by histone methyltransferases (HMT) and demethylation by histone demethylases (HDM)
such as members of the Jumonji protein family (Cheng and
Blumenthal, 2010).

Histone Methyltransferases
Phenotype

Figure 1. Environment and the epigenome. Differential expression of
genes is dependent on chromatin organization. This organization is
composed of DNA, nucleosomes, non-histone proteins, transcription
factors, chromatin-modifying enzymes, and regulatory RNAs collectively
known as the epigenome. The epigenome is sensitive to stress, toxins,
nutrition, infections, and other environmental factors with long-term
consequences for gene regulation and age-related diseases.

Histone Modifications
The basic unit of chromatin, the nucleosome, consists of a short
segment of DNA wrapped around core histones made up of two
copies of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. This organization provides a
rigid structure to chromatin (Campos and Reinberg, 2009). The
covalent modification of histones is an essential epigenetic
mechanism of gene regulation. These post-translational modifications (methylation of lysines and arginines, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and ADP-ribosylation)
occur most frequently at the N-terminal tails of the core histones
(Fuchs et al., 2006).
Acetylation of histones is associated with an “open” chromatin conformation that facilitates transcription (Campos and
Reinberg, 2009; Cheng and Blumenthal, 2010). The acetylated
N termini protruding from the nucleosome core provide reduced
affinity for the DNA, allowing the chromatin to adopt a more
relaxed structure for the recruitment of the basic transcription
machinery. For example, the acetylated histone marks H3K4ac
and H3K39ac are associated with transcriptional activation.
Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) such as CREB-binding protein CBP and its close homolog p300 carry out these modifications (Timmermann et al., 2001). Histone deacetylases (HDACs)
reverse HAT activity by making chromatin more condensed and

The Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins play an essential role during development and differentiation (Kerppola, 2009; Morey
and Helin, 2010). In mammals, there are two classes of complexes, designated Polycomb Repressive Complexes 1 and 2
(PRC1 and PRC2). PRC1 is formed from 4 proteins, RING1,
CBX family, PHC, and BMI1/MEL18. The core components of
PRC2 are EZH2/EZH1, EED, RBAP48/46, and SUZ12 (Simon
and Kingston, 2009; Morey and Helin, 2010). PRC2 regulates
transcriptional repression by catalyzing the di- and tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me2/3). Recent genomewide mapping studies revealed that PRC1, PRC2, and
H3K27me3 occupy the same sites at the regulatory regions of
several developmentally important genes, including members of
the Dlx, Hox, Pax, Sox, Gata, and Tbx families (Kerppola, 2009;
Simon and Kingston, 2009; Morey and Helin, 2010). The binding of PRC1 to chromatin is usually dependent on the activity of
PRC2. However, PRC2 may use different recruitment mechanisms to target different downstream genes (Peng et al., 2009;
Shen et al., 2009; Landeira et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010; Pasini
et al., 2010). PRC2 forms a stable complex with the transcriptional repressor JARID2, a member of the Jumonji C (JmjC) and
ARID domain protein family (Cheng and Blumenthal, 2010).
JARID2 binds to the PcG-responsive sites through the DNAbinding domain ARID (Fig. 2B) for many PRC2-regulated
genes. PRC2 can also be recruited to target promoters by noncoding RNAs (Zhao et al., 2008; Khalil et al., 2009).

Dna Methylation
DNA methylation is the covalent transfer of a methyl group
from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to cytosines in CpG dinucleotides (Herman and Baylin, 2003; Weber and Schübeler, 2007).
Mammalian genomes are punctuated by DNA sequences containing a high number of CpG sites termed CpG islands, which

The nucleosomes have activation marks such as acetylation (red circles) and H3K4 methylation (blue circles). The RNA Polymerase complex (Pol-II)
and transcription factors (TFs) bind to the promoter and initiate transcription. (B) Gene repression by the Polycomb repressive complexes (PRC1
and PRC2) is mediated by the DNA-binding protein JARID2 and accompanied by H3K27 methylation (green circles), loss of H3K4 methylation,
and deacetylation of nucleosomes. (C) DNA methylation (light blue circles) is mediated by the HP1-dependent recruitment of DNA methyltransferases
(DNMTs) and the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a. Methyl-binding proteins (MeCP2 or members of the MBP family) bind to the methylated DNA and
recruit histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs). Brown circles indicate H3K9 methylation. Overall, gene silencing is accompanied by the chromatin
compaction, loss of histone activation marks, and removal of transcription factors. (D) An epigenetic mechanism dependent on microRNA, MeCP2,
and Polycomb. In hepatic stellate cells, translation of the MeCP2 transcript is blocked by miR-132. Upon myofibroblast transdifferentiation, downregulation of miR-132 enables activation of MeCP2, which binds to the PPARγ promoter and recruits H3K9 histone methyltransferases and the HP1
repressor. In addition, MeCP2 stimulates chromatin condensation by recruiting PRC1 and PRC2. This eventually leads to repression of the PPARγ
transcription.

lack DNA methylation and associate with the majority of known
gene promoters (Illingworth and Bird, 2009). In eukaryotes, the
methylated CpG islands are found in non-coding regions of the
genome associated with transcriptional repression (Jones and
Liang, 2009), including developmental genes, repetitive sequences,
and germ-line specific or imprinted genes. The changes in DNA
methylation, such as hypomethylation, very often are associated
with chromosome instability and activation of transposable elements in human cancers (Cheung et al., 2009). DNA methylation
is catalyzed by a family of closely related DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b) (Hermann et al.,
2004). DNMT1 is a maintenance methyltransferase and is the
most abundant DNA methyltransferase in mammals. It predominantly adds methylation to DNA when one strand is already
methylated (hemi-methylated) (Jeltsch, 2006). The methylated
DNA can recruit the methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins
Kaiso, MeCP2, and members of the MBD family (Fig. 2C),
which recognize 5-methylcytosines in CpG islands and participate in chromatin silencing (McCabe et al., 2009).
It is important to note that DNA methylation and histone
methylation are tightly controlled events in eukaryotes (Cheng
and Blumenthal, 2010). The histone H3 N-terminal tail with an
unmethylated lysine 4 (H3K4) is required for DNA methylation
(Hu et al., 2009). In addition, tri-methylation of histone H3 on
lysine 9 (H3K9me3) participates in DNA methylation mediated
by DNMT1 (Rottach et al., 2010). The NP95 protein, which
contains SET-, Ring-, and Tudor domains, is responsible for
linking DNMT1 with DNA and histone H3 methylation
(H3K9me3). Therefore, NP95 coordinates two major epigenetic
silencing pathways, DNA methylation and histone methylation
(Rottach et al., 2010).

Epigenetic Events in Inflammation
Histone Methylation and Inflammation
Jmjd3, a member of the Jumonji family, is an inducible enzyme
that erases histone marks. This protein was recently found to
control differentiation and cell identity in macrophages, and
therefore provides a link between inflammation and reprogramming of the epigenome (Ishii et al., 2009). Jmjd3 is induced in
macrophages exposed to bacterial products and inflammatory
cytokines, where it binds the PcG target genes and regulates their
H3K27me3 levels and transcriptional activity (De Santa et al.,
2007). Continuous IL-4 treatment leads to activation of Jmjd3 and
the release of H3K27me3 repressive marks from the STAT6 promoter. Activated STAT6 positively regulates Jmjd3 by binding to
its promoter. Removal of H3K27 methylation marks by Jmjd3
triggers expression of specific inflammatory genes.
However, work by De Santa et al. (2009) revealed that Jmjd3
acts also through a H3K27 demethylation-independent mechanism. According to this study, Jmjd3 is preferentially recruited
to transcription start sites characterized by the presence of the
activation marker H3K4me3 and the presence of RNA
Polymerase II complex. This study found that the binding of
Jmjd3 to target genes is not accompanied by H3K27 demethylation. These findings indicate that reciprocal exchange in H3K4

J Dent Res 90(1) 2011

and H3K27 methylation can be an important epigenetic process
for the control of genes.
The mammalian genome contains several PcG target genes
critical in development and differentiation (Bernstein et al.,
2006; Mikkelsen et al., 2007). It was reported recently that
some of these targets are subject to aberrant DNA methylation
following chronic inflammation (Hahn et al., 2008). It was
shown that PcG proteins bind to the regulatory regions of target genes and recruit DNMTs (Fig. 2D) for more efficient
repression. Another pathway leading to gene repression was
recently described for NF-κB/RelB-dependent silencing in
severe systemic inflammation (SSI) caused by sepsis and other
acute inflammatory processes (Chen et al., 2009). Induction of
RelB by endotoxin activation is necessary and sufficient to
repress acute pro-inflammatory genes. During SSI, RelB
represses these genes by inducing heterochromatin formation
through direct interaction with the histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)
methyltransferase G9a. This interaction leads to trimethylation
of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and subsequent recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). HP1 and G9a form
a repressive complex at the promoters of RelB-dependent
genes (Fig. 2D) and lead to the recruitment of DNMT3a/b and
CpG methylation. This cooperative interaction of histone
methylation and DNA methylation in response to SSI was
recently reported for the TNFα promoter in blood leukocytes
(El Gazzar et al., 2008).

Histone Acetylation and Inflammation
Histone acetylation by HATs activates inflammatory genes,
whereas increased HDAC activity results in inflammatory gene
repression. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, airway
biopsies, and alveolar macrophages, increased acetylation of
histones at the promoter region of inflammatory genes is mediated by NF-κB. The increase in histone acetylation is associated
with decreased histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. For example, promoters of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1,
IL-2, IL-8, and IL-12) are rapidly acetylated by CBP/p300, leading to transcriptional activation, and display reduced HDAC
activity (Villagra et al., 2010). The recruitment of HDACs, in
contrast, leads to histone deacetylation and gene repression.
HDACs regulate transcription of both pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines through their recruitment to gene promoters via corepressor complexes and transcription factors such as FOXP3,
STATs, GATAs, ZEB1, and NF-κB (Villagra et al., 2010).
NF-κB is tightly controlled by the IκB kinase complex IKKα in response to cytokine treatment (Ghosh and Karin, 2009).
IKK-α binds to the NF-κB-dependent promoters with the assistance of the Polymerase II complex and CBP, where it acetylates
histone H3 at Lys9 (Yang et al., 2009) and phosphorylates histone H3 at Ser10 (Anest et al., 2003). This cytokine-induced
phosphorylation is critical for the subsequent CBP-mediated
acetylation of histone H3 on Lys14 (Yamamoto et al., 2003).
Acetylation of histone H3 at the promoters of several cytokines
and chemokines after inflammation results in the increased recruitment of NF-κB to these regions (Barnes, 2009). Glucocorticoid
receptor (GR) and HDAC2 can reverse this process, thus

promoting repression of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory genes
(Barnes, 2009).

DNA Methylation and Inflammation
DNA methylation is important in the regulation of inflammatory
genes. Promoter hypomethylation of the Toll-like receptor 2
(TLR2) gene is associated with increased pro-inflammatory
response to bacterial peptidoglycan in cystic fibrosis bronchial
epithelial cells (Shuto et al., 2006). DNA methylation and histone acetylation regulate TLR4 in intestinal epithelial cells
(Takahashi et al., 2009). DNA methylation and histone modifications play an important role in the establishment of the epigenetic landscape across the TNFα locus (Sullivan et al., 2007).
Environmental factors including bacterial infection were shown
to contribute to the epigenetic status of the genome (Barros and
Offenbacher, 2009). DNA methylation of imprinted genes plays
an important role in fetal development. For example, bacterial
infection induces hypermethylation in the promoter of the Igf2
gene in mice (Bobetsis et al., 2007). Expression microarray
studies in mice demonstrated that maternal infection was associated with changes in placental expression of key developmental
genes, including several imprinted genes (Bobetsis et al., 2010).
Chronic colonization of the human stomach by Helicobacter
pylori (HP) causes inflammation within the gastric mucosa and
activates multiple oncogenic pathways (Ding et al., 2010). HP
induces alterations in the DNA methylation pattern in gastric
epithelial cells (Niwa et al., 2010). Katayama et al. (2009)
showed that HP-induced DNA methylation in the Runx3 locus
causes loss of expression in gastric epithelial cells.

MicroRNAs and Inflammation
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate the expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level. miRNAs are transcribed as long preliminary
transcripts and, after cleavage by the Drosha and Pasha complexes in the nucleus, translocate to the cytoplasm to be processed by Dicer into 18- to 24-bp miRNA duplexes. The
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) incorporates these
short RNA duplexes and binds to the 3′ untranslated region
(3′UTR) of specific messenger RNAs for subsequent degradation or translational repression.
Recent investigations implicated miRNAs in the regulation
of development, differentiation, and disease (Friedman et al.,
2009; Sonkoly and Pivarcsi, 2009). miR-146a limits Toll-like
receptor signaling by blocking the signaling molecule TRAF6
(Taganov et al., 2006), and miR-155 targets the lipid phosphatase SHIP1 (O’Connell et al., 2009), an important signal for
macrophage activation. miR-132 has anti-inflammatory effects
by binding acetylcholine (ACH) mRNA, a critical inhibitor of
peripheral inflammation (Shaked et al., 2009). The exposure of
cultured macrophages to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to upregulation of miR-155, which targets the mRNA for CCAAT/
enhancer binding protein Beta (C/EBP Beta), implicated in the
regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines during macrophage

activation and the acute phase response (Worm et al., 2009).
Studies by Liu et al. (2009) demonstrated that the induction of
miR-147 by TLR prevents excessive inflammatory response
through a negative-feedback loop mechanism. TLR stimulation
induces miR-147 and requires activation of both NF-κB and
IRF3. Furthermore, miR-147 attenuates the TLR-induced
inflammatory response in macrophages (Liu et al., 2009). In
another study, miR-105 was shown to modulate TLR-2 translation in human gingival keratinocytes (Benakanakere et al.,
2009). It was recently suggested that the TLR4-dependent
reprogramming of inflammatory genes is mediated by two distinct levels of regulation (El Gazzar and McCall, 2010). The
first level is transcriptional control mediated by epigenetic
modifications, and the second level is regulated by the TLR4dependent differential expression of miRNAs (miR-221, miR579, and miR-125b).
About 30% of all human genes are estimated to be potential
miRNA targets (Lewis et al., 2005; Xie et al., 2005). Among
them are genes encoding the epigenetic markers EZH2,
DNMT3a and DNMT3b, and HDACs (Valeri et al., 2009).
miR-29 can reverse aberrant methylation in lung cancer by
targeting DNMT3a and DNMT3b (Fabbri et al., 2007), and
miR-143 regulates DNMT3a in colorectal cancer (Ng et al.,
2009). miR-29 promotes osteogenesis by targeting HDAC4 (H
Li et al., 2009), and miR-2861 controls osteoblast differentiation by repressing HDAC5 (Z. Li et al., 2009). The cartilagespecific miR-140 regulates HDAC4 (Tuddenham et al., 2006),
and MiR-449a targets HDAC1 in prostate cancer (Noonan
et al., 2009). However, the action of microRNA on epigenetic
markers can be indirect. One example of this is the viral
microRNA K12–4-5p, which blocks the retinoblastoma (Rb)like protein 2 (Rb12) transcript, a known repressor of DNMT1,
3a, and 3b mRNA levels (Lu et al., 2010). Expression of EZH2
is blocked by miR-101 (Varambally et al., 2008; Friedman
et al., 2009), miR-26a (Sander et al., 2008; Wong and Tellam,
2008), and miR-214 (Juan et al., 2009). In the latter case,
EZH2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2, and miR-214 establish a
negative regulatory loop controlling PcG-dependent gene
expression. PcG proteins repress transcription of miR-214 in
undifferentiated skeletal muscle cells. Differentiation coincides with the PcG disengagement and activation of miR-214
transcription. miR-214, in turn, targets EZH2 (Juan et al.,
2009).
In summary, we considered three different epigenetic processes of gene repression: DNA methylation, histone modifications, and targeting by microRNAs. Recently, an epigenetic
relay pathway was described to explain the repression of
PPARγ transcription (Mann et al., 2009). This pathway
(Fig. 2D) is dependent on a precisely controlled mechanism,
which involves MeCP2, EZH2, and miR-132. The authors
showed that down-regulation of miR-132 caused the release
of the MeCP2 translational block. Consequently, MeCP2
mediates histone H3 methylation on Lys9 and Lys27 (H3K9
and H3K27) through the recruitment of HP1/G9a and PRC1/2
complexes at the PPARγ promoter region (Mann et al.,
2009).

NF-κB, IL6, let-7 microRNA, and Lin28B are key components of the
positive feedback loop underlying the epigenetic switch from normal
to transformed cells. The switch is induced by an initial inflammatory
signal (Src activation) that activates NF-κB, which turns on IL6
transcription and inhibits let-7 microRNA via Lin28B. The resulting high
levels of IL6 activate NF-κB, thereby completing the positive feedback
loop that maintains the transformed phenotype.

Inflammation and Cancer
Inflammation contributes to the initiation and development of
cancer (Rajput and Wilber, 2010). Until recently, the mechanistic aspects of this phenomenon were not clearly understood. The
study by Iliopoulos et al. (2009) addressed this question by
proposing a model that links inflammation to the oncogenic
transformation. This model, based on a positive feedback loop
mechanism, involves key molecular players: NF-κB, RNAbinding protein Lin-28, let-7 microRNA, and IL-6 cytokine
(Fig. 3). Activation of the Src oncoprotein triggered the inflammatory response critical for cellular transformation via a NF-κBdependent mechanism (Page et al., 2009). NF-κB activated
transcription of Lin-28, which in turn inhibited the let-7
microRNA. let-7 repressed cellular transformation by blocking
IL-6. Therefore, NF-κB activation and subsequent repression of
let-7 resulted in a dramatic increase of IL-6, which is necessary

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by the progressive destruction of
articular cartilage and bone. Studies showed that epigenetic
modifications such as genomic DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and miRNAs contribute to the pathogenesis of RA
(Strietholt et al., 2008; Maciejewska Rodrigues et al., 2009;
Brooks et al., 2010). The global DNA methylation pattern in RA
synovial fibroblasts was shown to be reduced compared with that
of cells derived from healthy controls (Karouzakis et al., 2009).
Several studies have suggested a central role for chronic
inflammation in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer (Bowman et al., 2009; Lee
et al., 2009; Yao and Rahman, 2009). Recent evidence implicates
epigenetic modifications in the development of tolerance in macrophages and T-cell function (Adcock et al., 2007). Reduced
HDAC2 expression and activity are reported in lung macrophages, biopsies, and blood cells from patients with COPD,
severe asthma, and smoking asthma (Adcock et al., 2007).
Age-associated changes in immune response increase the
risk of infection and promote inflammation and increased reactivity to self-antigens and cancer. It has been suggested that
age-associated hypomethylation of the DNA may be the cause
of chronic inflammation and cancer (Agrawal et al., 2010). El
Mezayen et al. (2009) showed the age-dependent up-regulation
of the IL-23p19 gene expression associated with H3K4 methylation in dendritic cells.
Periodontitis is a multifactorial infection characterized by
inflammation and destruction of tooth-supporting tissues
(Gomez et al., 2009). The levels of prostaglandin E and the
prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 (PTGS2) increase in
progressing periodontal lesions, but decrease in chronic disease.
It was reported that expression of the PTGS2 gene decreases in
chronic periodontitis due to promoter hypermethylation (Zhang
et al., 2010).

Conclusions
Knowledge about alterations in histone modifications, DNA
methylation, and microRNA regulation will provide a better
understanding of the molecular basis for various chronic inflammatory diseases. Progress in studies of epigenetic alterations
during inflammatory response opens opportunities for the development of efficient medications for specific targets. Among the
drugs currently proposed for epigenetic therapy are histone
deacetylase inhibitors and demethylating agents, which target
chromatin in rapidly dividing tumor cells and restore normal cell
