The a-synuclein has been implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD), because
mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene cause autosomal-dominant hereditary PD and fibrillary
aggregates of alpha-synuclein are the major component of Lewy bodies. Since presynaptic accumulation of a-synuclein aggregates may trigger synaptic dysfunction and degeneration, we have
analyzed alterations in synaptosomal proteins in early symptomatic a-synuclein(A30P)-transgenic mice by two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis. Moreover, we carried out microRNA expression profiling using microfluidic chips, as microRNA have recently been shown to
regulate synaptic plasticity in rodents and to modulate polyglutamine-induced protein aggregation and neurodegeneration in flies. Differentially expressed proteins in a-synuclein(A30P)transgenic mice point to alterations in mitochondrial function, actin dynamics, iron transport,
and vesicle exocytosis, thus partially resembling findings in PD patients. Oxygen consumption of
isolated brain mitochondria, however, was not reduced in mutant mice. Levels of several microRNA (miR-10a, -10b, -212, -132, -495) were significantly altered. One of them (miR-132) has been
reported to be highly inducible by growth factors and to be a key regulator of neurite outgrowth.
Moreover, miR-132-recognition sequences were detected in the mRNA transcripts of two differentially expressed proteins. MicroRNA may thus represent novel biomarkers for neuronal malfunction and potential therapeutic targets for human neurodegenerative diseases.

Introduction

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is diagnosed postmortem by the
selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia
nigra and the presence of intraneuronal protein deposits
termed Lewy bodies. Biochemical analysis led to the identification of a-synuclein as a major component of Lewy bodies

in PD brains. In the healthy brain, a-synuclein is abundantly
expressed in central neurons and localizes to presynaptic
terminals, where it may regulate synaptic vesicle mobilization. Certain point mutations in the a-synuclein gene cause
autosomal-dominant hereditary Parkinson’s disease (PD).
The corresponding amino acid exchanges (A30P, E46K,
A53T) favor aggregation of a-synuclein both in vitro and in
vivo [1, 2]. Gene multiplications in the wild-type a-synuclein
gene have also been linked to rare familial forms of PD. Although the pathomechanisms underlying familial and
sporadic PD remain enigmatic, mitochondrial or proteasomal dysfunction and oxidative stress appear to be major
contributors [1, 2]. Recent histological and biochemical analysis of brain samples revealed that about 90% of a-synuclein
aggregates localize to presynaptic endings where they seem
to affect synaptic structure and function [3]. Several transgenic mouse models overexpressing mutant a-synuclein

have been generated that age-dependently exhibit a-synuclein immunoreactive intraneuronal inclusions, locomotor
dysfunction and loss of dopaminergic synapses, thus partially mimicking PD [4, 5]. To gain insight into the mechanisms of a-synuclein-mediated neurotoxicity, we performed a
brain proteome analysis of the a-synuclein(A30P)-transgenic
mice mouse model for PD [6] using 2-D DIGE. Since aggregation of mutant a-synuclein may start within presynaptic
terminals before being retrogradely transported and sequestered into somatic Lewy bodies [3], we focused on alterations
in synaptosomal proteins in early symptomatic transgenic
mice.
In addition, we performed a differential expression analysis for microRNA (miRNA) using microarray technology.
MiRNA are non-coding transcripts of 19–24 nucleotides that
are processed from double-stranded hairpin precursors by an
RNase termed Dicer [7]. The mature single-stranded miRNA
is then translocated to the RNA-induced silencing complex
that suppresses translation of the target mRNA. Recent evidence indicates that in multicellular organisms, hundreds of
miRNA can regulate the translation of about one third of the
coding mRNA [7]. MiRNA have been shown to modulate
stem-cell differentiation, hematopoiesis, muscle development, insulin secretion, cholesterol metabolism, and
immune responses. Aberrant miRNA expression has been
implicated in cancer and heart disease [8]. In the mammalian nervous system, expression of various miRNA increases
during development and may influence neural patterning,
cell specification and axonal path finding [7, 9]. In mature
neurons, depolarization causes a sixfold increase in miR-134
expression. Brain-specific miR-134 seems to block translation of dendritic mRNA (e.g. LIM-domain kinase 1), thereby
regulating synaptic plasticity and spine size [10]. Furthermore, growth factor treatment induced a rapid and persistent
neuronal expression of miR-132 that promotes neurite outgrowth by targeting p250GAP, a regulator of Rho/Rac signaling [11]. Recent findings indicate that miRNA may also
play a role in neurodegeneration [12]. General reduction of
miRNA processing by knocking down Dicer activity massively enhances neurodegeneration in fruit flies that overexpress pathogenic Ataxin-3 or Tau protein [12]. Transgenic
overexpression of miRNA ban suppressed neurodegeneration. Notably, ban overexpression did not alter aggregation of
toxic proteins or execution of programmed cell death [12].
Taken together, changes in miRNA expression may represent
a molecular signature of alterations in neuronal structure or
function and may contribute to neuronal survival in the
context of human neurodegenerative diseases [13, 14].

Materials and methods

2.1 Animals
Generation and characterization of homozygous (Thy1)-human a-synuclein(A30P)-transgenic mice (line 31H) have

Proteomics Clin. Appl. 2008, 2, 697–705

been described in detail elsewhere [6]. Age- and sex-matched,
non-transgenic C57BL/6 mice were used as controls. All
animal procedures were approved by the Federal Animal
Care Committee.

2.2 Subcellular fractionation
Synaptosomal fractions were isolated by differential
centrifugation using standard protocols. Enrichment of
presynaptic marker proteins was assessed in previous
studies [15, 16]. Briefly, mice (n = 4 per group) were killed
by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation. The brains
were rapidly removed and placed into ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.4, 320 mM
sucrose, 0.2 mM DTT, 100 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2,
0.01 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and phosphatase/protease
inhibitor cocktails (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). All subsequent steps were performed at 47C. The brains were
cross-sectioned at Bregma -2.8 mm. The cerebellum was
discarded. The cortex containing scattered proteinase Kresistant a-synuclein aggregates and the brainstem showing abundant histopathology at 12 months of age [6] were
separately microdissected. Tissue samples were homogenized in 1:10 w/v homogenization buffer with 12 strokes
in a Teflon-glass douncer. The homogenate was centrifuged
for 10 min at 8006g followed by centrifugation of the
supernatant at 92006g for 15 min. The resulting pellet
(P2), representing the crude synaptosomal fraction, and
the supernatant (S2) were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 30 mM Tris, 8 M urea, 4% w/v CHAPS, pH 8.5
(GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). Proteins in the S2
supernatant were precipitated using the 2D Clean-up Kit
before solubilization as described in the manufacturer’s
protocol (GE Healthcare). Aliquots were taken for protein
determination using the modified Bio-Rad protein assay
(Bio-Rad, München, Germany) before freezing the samples
at 2807C.
Metabolically active mitochondria were isolated using
the Mitochondria Isolation Kit (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) [16]. Mice (n = 3 per group) were killed and brain
regions were microdissected as described above. Tissue
samples were homogenized in 1:10 w/v ice-cold extraction
buffer (200 mM mannitol, 1 mM EGTA, 70 mM sucrose,
2 mg/mL BSA, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) using a Teflon-glass
potter homogenizer (10 strokes, 400 rpm). All steps were
performed at 47C. The homogenate was centrifuged for
4 min at 14006g. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged for 5 min at 30 7006g. The P2 pellet containing
myelin, synaptosomes and mitochondria was resuspended
in 2 mL extraction buffer and centrifuged for 3 min at
8006g. The supernatant was again centrifuged for 5 min at
32 5006g and the resulting pellet was resuspended in
120 mL extraction buffer. Aliquots were taken for determination of protein concentration using the Pierce BCA kit
(Pierce, Bonn, Germany).

2.3 Mitochondrial respiration
Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was monitored in the
mitochondrial fractions using an Oxygraph-2k system which
is equipped with two chambers and polarographic oxygen
sensors (Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria) [16, 17]. Mitochondria (0.4 mg at 1 mg/mL) were incubated at 257C in respiration buffer (100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 75 mM mannitol,
25 mM sucrose, 1 mM KH2PO4, 0.5 mg/mL BSA, 10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Oxygen consumption was initiated by
administration of pyruvate and malate (5 mM each). Thereafter, state 3 respiration was triggered by administration of
ADP (375 mM). Carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 1 mM) was then added to measure
uncoupled respiration. Rotenone (5 mM) was subsequently
administered to inhibit complex I activity. Finally, the complex II substrate succinate was added (5 mM) and respiration
measurement was completed. Values were normalized to
protein content.
2.4 Gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting
The 2-D DIGE was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (GE Healthcare) with minor modifications [18, 19]. In short, samples (four biological replicates per group) in lysis buffer were set to a protein concentration of 2 mg/mL and centrifuged at 12 0006g for
10 min to remove insoluble material. Proteins (50 mg/sample) were labeled with 400 pmol Cy3 or Cy5 cyanine dye. As
internal standard aliquots of each sample were pooled and
labeled with Cy2 dye. To exclude preferential labeling of the
dyes, samples were also reverse labeled. The two differentially labeled samples plus the internal standard were combined and an equal volume of 2x sample buffer (8 M urea,
4% w/v CHAPS, 2% w/v DTT, 2% v/v Pharmalyte) was
added. Finally, DeStreak Rehydration solution (plus 0.5% v/v
Pharmalyte) was added to a final volume of 450 mL. IPG
strips (Immobiline DryStrip, 24 cm, pH 3–10 NL, GE
Healthcare, Germany) were rehydrated in the presence of
protein samples for 12 h at 30 V. IEF was performed using an
Ettan IPGphor (GE Healthcare) at a maximum current of
50 mA/strip as follows: 300 V for 3 h, 1000 V for 6 h, and
8000 V for 7 h. Following equilibration, the IPG strips were
placed on top of 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was conducted overnight in an
Ettan DALT twelve electrophoresis system (GE Healthcare) at
20 mA/gel and 207C in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris,
192 mM glycine, and 0.2% w/v SDS. The 2-D DIGE was
performed twice (two gel replicates/sample) generating
similar results. NEPHGE, pH 3–10 NL (four independent
biological replicates per group) was performed by Wita (Teltow, Germany).
All gels were scanned between the low-fluorescent glass
plates using a Typhoon 9400 laser scanner (GE Healthcare).
Gel images were analyzed automatically using DeCyder
software version 5.0 (Differential In-gel Analysis and Biolog© 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

ical Variation Analysis) (GE Healthcare), which performs
spot detection, in-gel normalization, spot matching, and statistical analysis of protein abundance levels between different gels. Software algorithms and statistical confidence are
described in detail by others [20]. Protein spots of interest
were excised from the gels using an Ettan Spot Picker robot
(GE Healthcare). Gel pieces were incubated in 100 mL ACN
for 5 min and subsequently dried in a vacuum centrifuge.
Gel pieces were rehydrated with 5 mL of 50 mM ammonium
bicarbonate containing 20 ng/mL trypsin (sequencing grade,
Promega, Mannheim, Germany) for 30 min at 47C. Thereafter, proteins were digested overnight at 377C. The resulting
peptides were eluted with 20 mL of 0.1% v/v TFA by sonication for 15 min.
Proteins (20 mg/lane) were separated on 12% polyacrylamide minigels and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a wet transfer system (Bio-Rad,
München, Germany). After blocking in buffer containing
20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and
5% BSA for 90 min, the membranes were incubated overnight with an affinity-purified sheep polyclonal antibody
against transferrin (1 mg/mL, Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and
enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL kit; GE
Healthcare) were used for detection. Membranes were
checked for protein load and protein transfer using a
commercial kit (MemCode Reversible Protein Stain Kit,
Pierce, Rockford, IL) that reversibly stains for total protein.
Densitometric analysis of immunoblots was performed
using Quantity One (Bio-Rad).
2.5 MS
MS/MS analysis was performed with an UltiMate
nanoHPLC system (LC Packings, Amsterdam, Netherlands)
connected to a QSTAR XL quadrupole TOF hybrid mass
spectrometer (ABI Sciex, Toronto, Canada) [21]. The dried
peptide sample was dissolved in 10 mL of 2% ACN, 0.1%
TCA, applied to a precolumn (PepMap C18, 0.365 mm)
(Dionex, Idstein, Germany) and separated using an analytical column (PepMap C18, 0.0756150 mm) (Dionex) at a
flow rate of 250 nL/min. The mobile phases were A = 2%
ACN, 0.1% formic acid and B = 80% ACN, 0.1% formic acid.
The gradient for separation was 5–50% B in 30 min, 50–
100% B in 2 min. A survey scan from m/z 350 to 1300 was
performed for 1 s with subsequent two MS/MS scans for 2 s
each. Precursor ions were dynamically excluded for 120 s.
Under script control (Analyst, ABI Sciex) the acquired product ion spectra were submitted to the MASCOT database
search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK) against the
Swiss-Prot database with the following search parameters:
maximum of one missed trypsin cleavage, cysteine carbamidomethylation, methionine oxidation, and a maximum
0.20 Da error tolerance in both the MS and MS/MS data. All
hits were manually verified using accepted rules for peptide
fragmentation [21].

2.6 Assay of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase
Brainstem tissue samples were suspended in 200 mL PBS by
repeated pipetting and sonicated three times on ice for 15 s
at 8 W at 45-s intervals. An aliquot of the homogenate (5–
7 mg) was added to the 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase
assay. Protein was estimated using the method of Bradford
(Bio-Rad). The hydratase assay mixture contained, in a final
volume of 25 mL, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA,
1 mg/mL BSA and 10 mM 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA or glutaconyl-CoA. After incubation at 377C for 60 min, the reaction
was terminated by the addition of 2.5 mL of 2 mM HCl. The
samples were homogenized and the assay tubes were placed
on ice. After 5 min, the homogenates were brought to pH 6
with 2 mM KOH, 1 mM MES pH 6 and centrifuged at
21 0006g for 10 min at 47C. The supernatant was transferred to an HPLC vial. The products of the reaction,
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, or 3-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA
were detected at 260 nm using the HPLC system as described previously [22].
2.7 MicroRNA expression analysis
MiRNA expression profiling was performed using LC Sciences microfluidic chip technology (LC Sciences, Houston,
TX). Briefly, mice (n = 3 per group) were killed by decapitation, the brains were rapidly removed and the brainstems
were microdissected as described above. Brainstem tissue
samples were homogenized and total RNA was extracted
using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) with minor modifications. In
brief, RNA was precipitated using 1.5 mL isopropyl alcohol/
1 mL of Trizol reagent. The extracts were incubated at -207C
overnight and subsequently centrifuged at 12 0006g for
10 min at 47C to precipitate low-molecular weight RNA. The
RNA pellets were resuspended in RNase-free water for OD
measurements. OD 260 nm/280 nm ratios were all above 1.8
and OD 260 nm/230 nm ratios were above 1.5. Following
administration of three volumes of 100% ethanol, 1/10 volume of 3 M NaOAc, pH 4.8, and 10 mM EDTA, samples were
shipped on dry ice to LC Sciences for chip analysis. Chip
design, assay protocol, and data analysis are described in
detail elsewhere (www.lcsciences.com). Total RNA samples
(10 mg each) were size fractionated using a YM-100 Microcon
centrifugal filter (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and the small
RNA (,300 nt) were 3’-extended with a poly(A) tail using
poly(A) polymerase. An oligonucleotide tag was then ligated
to the poly(A) tail for fluorescent dye staining. RNA samples
from a-synuclein(A30P)-transgenic and control mice were
labeled with green-fluorescent Cy3 dye and red-fluorescent
Cy5 dye, respectively. Both samples were then hybridized to
the same mParaflo microfluidic chip (#MRA-1002) (LC Sciences) containing 266 unique mature mouse miRNA probes
in triplicate. On the microfluidic chip, each detection probe
consisted of a chemically modified nucleotide coding segment complementary to target miRNA (from miRBase,

Proteomics Clin. Appl. 2008, 2, 697–705

http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/) and a spacer segment of polyethylene glycol to extend the coding segment
away from the substrate. The detection probes were made by
in situ synthesis using photogenerated reagent chemistry.
The hybridization melting temperatures were balanced by
chemical modifications of the detection probes. Hybridization used 100 mL 6 x SSPE buffer (0.90 M NaCl, 60 mM
Na2HPO4, 6 mM EDTA, pH 6.8) containing 25% formamide
at 347C. After hybridization, fluorescence images were collected using a laser scanner (GenePix 4000B, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and digitized using Array-Pro image
analysis software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Data
were analyzed by first subtracting the background and then
normalizing the signals. Finally, the ratio of the Cy3/Cy5
signals (log2 transformed) and p-values of the t-test were
calculated. Differentially detected signals were those with pvalues ,0.01.
2.8 Gene expression profiling
Affymetrix (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) genechip (HGU133AB) analysis was performed by Gene Logic (Gene
Logic, Gaithersburg, MD) using human postmortem brain
samples.

Results

3.1 Proteome analysis
Using 2-D DIGE analysis of murine brainstem tissue, we
detected about 1000 spots per gel. Protein spots that were
present in all gels (four biological replicates per group) and
showed statistically significant differences (p,0.05, t-test,
DeCyder, Biological Variation Analysis) were selected for
further analysis. By these criteria, 11 spots were found to be
differentially expressed in a-synuclein(A30P) overexpressing
mice compared to non-transgenic controls. Three spots were
very faint and thus could not be identified unambiguously by
MS. Seven differentially expressed proteins were identified
in the P2/S2 fractions and are listed in Table 1. Magnified
sections of representative gel images are shown in Fig. 1.
The two transferrin spots at pI values of 6.2 and 6.0 (Fig. 1)
may represent apotransferrin and monoferric transferrin as
shown by others [23]. In order to increase detection of membrane proteins and spot resolution [24], we analyzed the
synaptosomal P2 fraction (four independent biological
replicates per group) also by NEPHGE and used second dimension gels 24630 cm in size (Supporting Information
Fig. 1). However, additional deregulated synaptosomal proteins were not detected by NEPHGE.
By immunoblotting using a commercially available antitransferrin antibody and densitometric analysis we verified a
significant increase in transferrin (194 6 21% of non-transgenic controls, mean 6 SD) in brainstem lysates of a-synuclein(A30P) overexpressing mice (Fig. 2). Notably, two mitowww.clinical.proteomics-journal.com

3.2 Respiration of isolated mitochondria

images showing the decrease in 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase (upper row, arrowhead) and the increase in transferrin
(lower row, arrowheads) in transgenic mice.

Impairment of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation has
been reported in PD and pharmacological inhibition causes a
Parkinsonian phenotype in animal models [2]. To analyze the
functional significance of mitochondrial proteome alterations, we monitored the respiration rate of crude mitochondrial preparations using the Oxygraph-2k system (Oroboros).
As shown in Fig. 3A, basal mitochondrial respiration in the
presence of malate and pyruvate did not differ between
a-synuclein(A30P) overexpressing mice and control animals
(n = 3 per group). ADP-stimulated state 3 respiration and
FCCP-triggered uncoupled respiration were also unchanged
in mitochondria purified from brainstem tissue.
3.3 3-Methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase activity

Figure 2. Immunoblot analysis of transferrin levels in brainstem
S2 fractions. An increase in transferrin is detectable in lysates of
four a-synuclein(A30P) overexpressing mice (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7)
compared to wild-type controls (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8).

chondrial proteins were significantly down-regulated in
mutant mice as compared to controls. ATP synthase (EC
3.6.3.14) is involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase (EC 4.2.1.18)
(Fig. 1) is active in mitochondrial energy metabolism.
Affymetrix genechip (HG-U133AB) analysis revealed an
age-dependent decline in 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase
mRNA levels in the human brain. More importantly, a significant (p,0.05, ANOVA) reduction in 3-methylglutaconylCoA hydratase mRNA expression by approximately 20% was
also observed in several brain areas of PD patients (e.g. substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, nucleus ambiguus, putamen,
frontal cortex) compared to age-matched controls (n10
samples each).

Protein levels of 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase declined
by approximately 50% in a-synuclein(A30P)-transgenic mice
(Table 1). In order to also monitor enzyme function, we tested brainstem extracts (n = 3 per group) for hydratase activity
using two different substrates, 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA and
glutaconyl-CoA. However, 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase activity was below the detection limit of our assay probably due to the very low amounts of enzyme present in the
extracts (Fig. 1).
3.4 MicroRNA expression analysis
Small RNA isolated from a-synuclein(A30P)-transgenic and
control mice brainstem tissue (n = 3 per group) were labeled
with green-fluorescent Cy3 dye and red-fluorescent Cy5 dye,
respectively. Both samples were then hybridized to the same
microfluidic chip containing 266 unique mouse miRNA
probes in triplicate. The RNA extracts were of good quality
and produced strong signals on the chips with low noise
levels. Figure 3B displays representative regions of chip

Cy3 level is higher than Cy5 level. The color is red when Cy3
level is lower than Cy5 level. MiRNA that were modulated on
three chips with a p-value ,0.01 were considered differentially expressed and are listed in Table 2. Signal intensities of
miR-10a, and -10b are low, indicating that these miRNA are
weakly expressed in the murine brainstem, whereas miR212, -495, and -132 are present at moderate to high levels.
Although the miRNA listed in Table 2 were all down-regulated, there was no general decline in miRNA expression in
the brainstems of mutant a-synuclein overexpressing mice.
Using computational target prediction algorithms (miRanda, miRBase, Targetscan) we could identify sortin nexin-12
and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 as potential targets for
miR-132 as has been reported by others [25, 26]. The increase
in these proteins in the brainstem of our mutant a-synuclein-transgenic mice shown by 2-D DIGE analysis (Table 1)
would be consistent with the decline in miR-132 levels
detected on microchips (Table 2).

Discussion

In the human a-synuclein(A30P)-transgenic mouse model
for PD, behavioral impairment and a-synuclein aggregation
starts at approximately 12 months of age [6]. In a recent
study using 2-DE, oxidative modifications in two glycolytic
enzymes were detected in a-synuclein(A30P)-transgenic
mice brains compared to non-transgenic controls [27]. In this
study, however, end-stage mice and total brain homogenates
were analyzed. In order to detect early pathogenic events
within vulnerable compartments, we tested a-synuclein
(A30P) overexpressing mice at the onset of motor dysfunction, microdissected brainstem tissue and enriched the
synaptosomal fraction, where aggregated a-synuclein may
exert its pathogenic effects [3, 6]. Using 2-D DIGE, we
detected changes in proteins involved in mitochondrial
function, iron transport, actin dynamics, and vesicle exocytosis. Lack of neuronal cell loss and absence of glial activation
in our transgenic mouse model might explain why these
alterations in protein levels were only moderate ranging
from 250 to 145%. Changes in actin cytoskeletal proteins

and mitochondrial proteins (e.g. ATP synthase subunits)
were also detected in proteomic studies analyzing heads
from early symptomatic a-synuclein(A30P)-transgenic Drosophila melanogaster [28] and autopsy brain tissue from
sporadic PD patients, respectively [29]. Isotope-coded affinity
tag-based analysis of mitochondria-enriched fractions from
nigral tissue revealed 119 differentially-expressed proteins in
PD patients, including subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport complexes [30]. Detailed immunoblot analysis
of the electron transport complexes demonstrated specific
changes in complex I subunit composition in the PD frontal
cortex [31]. Although these proteomic data point to similar
functional defects in patients and animal models, there is
only minor overlap in the proteins identified.
Mitochondrial dysfunction seems to play a central role in
PD and a significant reduction in mitochondrial complex I
catalytic activity has been shown in brain tissue of sporadic
PD patients [2, 31]. In our study, respiration of mitochondria
enriched from brainstem tissue did not differ between early
symptomatic (12-months-old) a-synuclein(A30P)-transgenic
mice and controls. Consistently, unchanged brain mitochondrial respiration was recently reported in two mouse
lines that overexpress double mutant a-synuclein(A30P/
A53T) [32]. On the other hand, mitochondrial complex IV
activity declined by about 80% in the spinal cord of symptomatic a-synuclein(A53T)-transgenic mice. In contrast to the
aforementioned mouse lines, this line exhibits a massive loss
of central neurons [33].
The factors underlying differences in vulnerability
remain enigmatic. Our proteomic data do not show a compensatory up-regulation of potential neuroprotective proteins (e.g. HSP, glycolytic enzymes), whereas protein levels of
mitochondrial ATP synthase alpha chain and 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA (MG-CoA) hydratase significantly decreased in
the mutant mice. In order to monitor enzyme function, we
tested brainstem extracts for MG-CoA hydratase activity [22].
However, catalytic activity was below the detection limit of
our assay probably due to the very low amounts of enzyme
present in the mouse brainstem extracts. On the other hand,
mRNA levels of MG-CoA hydratase were also reduced in
affected brain regions of PD patients pointing to a pathophysiological function. MG-CoA hydratase catalyses the
hydration of MG-CoA to 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA
(HMG-CoA) in the leucine degradation pathway. HMG-CoA
is then converted to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA [22].
Reduced mitochondrial MG-CoA hydratase activity in
humans results in psychomotor retardation with progressive
neurological symptoms. The ketone bodies acetoacetate and
3-hydroxybutyrate represent a major alternative to glucose as
energy substrate in the mammalian brain. Moreover,
administration of ketone bodies protected cultured midbrain
neurons against the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor
MPP1 and increased survival of a-synuclein(A53T)-transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to rotenone [34, 35].

demonstrated iron accumulation in the substantia nigra of
early symptomatic familial and sporadic PD patients [36, 37].
Extracellular iron is bound to transferrin and is internalized
by cells via the transferrin receptor. The significant increase
in brainstem transferrin levels in our a-synuclein(A30P)
overexpressing mice may be indicative of an enhanced iron
uptake. Sorting nexin-12 (SNX12) is a member of the SNX3/
Grd19 group of cellular trafficking proteins [38]. Notably,
SNX3 is involved in transport of internalized transferrin
receptors to recycling endosomes and of epidermal growth
factor receptors to lysosomes. LIM and SH3 domain protein
(LASP-1) is an actin-associated protein that is concentrated at
neuronal synapses where it may be involved in actin cytoskeleton reorganization contributing to synaptic plasticity
[39]. LASP-1 also binds to dynamin, which is critically
required for synaptic vesicle endocytosis [40, 41]. Vesiclefusion ATPase (also known as N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive
fusion protein) is broadly required for intracellular membrane fusion including calcium-sensitive synaptic vesicle
exocytosis [42]. Interestingly, alterations in epidermal growth
factor receptor trafficking and synaptic vesicle dynamics
have been detected in Parkin-deficient cells and a-synuclein
(A30P) overexpressing neurons, respectively [43, 44].
Our miRNA expression analysis led to the identification
of numerous brainstem-enriched miRNA. More importantly,
we demonstrate for the first time that miRNA expression
changes in a transgenic mouse model for PD in the absence
of neuronal cell loss. Recent studies in cultured primary
neurons demonstrated that expression of miR-132 significantly increases following growth factor administration or
neuronal depolarization [11, 25]. Transfection with miR-132
expression vectors enhances neuronal excitability by glutamate [25]. The decline in miR-132 levels in our a-synuclein(A30P)-transgenic mice may thus represent a molecular
signature for a concomitant decrease in neurotrophic support and/or neuronal activity in the affected brainstem.
Moreover, the decrease in miR-132 may contribute to the
increased expression of its predicted targets sortin nexin-12
and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 [25, 26]. After submission of this manuscript, Kim and coworkers reported a
decrease of miR-133b in midbrain samples from PD patients
[45]. MiRNA-133b modulates the differentiation of embryonic rat dopaminergic neurons in culture by targeting the
transcription factor Pitx3 [45]. It will be important to identify
and validate the mRNAs targets of miR-132, -133b, -212, and
-495 in the ageing brain. Recent evidence suggests that
miRNA might be drug targets for the treatment of human
diseases and can be specifically blocked in vivo [46]. Thus,
analysis of miRNA expression in biopsy specimen from diseased human brain combined with target mRNA identification may provide new therapeutic options.
