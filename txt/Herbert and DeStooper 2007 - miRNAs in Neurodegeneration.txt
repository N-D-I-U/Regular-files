systems: surveillance cameras, wireless networks, and radio-frequency identification
(RFID) tags for patients.
Video surveillance cameras have become a
commonplace component of security systems
in public places. High-resolution images over
a wide field of view can be digitally stored
indefinitely to identify and track persons.
Mindful of visual privacy, researchers have
developed an approach to perturb all facial
features so that each face matches a number of
others (8). However, major practical problems
remain in implementing such procedures, in
say a football stadium, underlining the need
for further research; the existing techniques
are too expensive and slow to be used in general video surveillance.
The rich connectivity of wireless networks
involves a spectrum shared by a wide variety of
devices, such as laptops, Bluetooth headsets,
and mobile phones. Because any device can be
identified, tracked over time, and profiled by
anyone with sufficient technical capability, this
congestion raises concerns that the usual
encryption procedures cannot protect an individual’s locational privacy. Greenstein has
identified various research challenges in
designing wireless systems that are privacyaware (9). The challenges include, for example,
cryptographic schemes to prevent the necessary device addresses from being identified
without burdensome changes to existing protocols for media access, and ways for a device to
discover and bind to resources without revealing to an eavesdropper that it is doing so.
Wrong-site surgery is estimated to occur
between 1300 and 2700 times per year in the
United States (10). With an RFID tag attached
to a patient, a physician in the operating room
can reduce the number of such errors by verifying the correct patient, procedure, and site.
The U.K. health minister Lord Hunt recently
supported recommendations for such strategies (11). Because privacy is affected, the U.S.
National Institute of Standards has recommended stringent practices in designing an
RFID system (12, 13). For example, only the
surgeon and others with a need to know would
have access. Only as much personal data are
captured as is necessary; thus, the tags would
not contain personal financial information.
Last year, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital,
UK, began to expand the use of RFID
bracelets to all patients on five wards, linking
them to a digital photograph and the electronic
medical records for their visit.
To ensure clarity and accountability (14),
privacy-aware systems must implement a
definition of privacy that users find meaningful, reasonable, and transparent. A privacy

risk assessment must be performed to identify the potential for disclosure of personal
information. Disclosures must be revealed,
and measures must be in place to deal with
privacy failures. Access by individuals to
their personal data should be easy, and mechanisms must be in place to ensure that personal data are accurate.
To ensure effectiveness, systems must
make a trade-off between privacy risk and
utility, but reasonable expectations for privacy must always be met. For example, a subject need not be identified by name if just
authentication of the subject’s role in the system is required. Achieving “adequate” privacy will require engineering innovation,
managerial commitment, informed cooperation of data subjects, and social controls (legislation, regulation, codes of conduct by professional associations, and response to reactions of the public).

miRNAs in Neurodegeneration
Sébastien S. Hébert and Bart De Strooper
Noncoding microRNAs are necessary for the survival of postmitotic cells such as neurons that die
in Parkinson’s and other brain diseases.

he human genome sequencing effort
has taught us that it takes relatively few
genes to build a human being. Complexity arises from the combination of these
building blocks into genetic programs that are
finely tuned in space and time during cell
and tissue differentiation. A major part of
this regulation is performed by microRNAs
(miRNAs), small RNA molecules encoded by
the genome that are not translated into proteins; rather, they control the expression of
genes. Deregulation of miRNA function has
been implicated in human diseases including cancer and heart disease (1, 2). On page
1220 of this issue, Kim et al. (3) suggest
that miRNAs are essential for maintaining
dopaminergic neurons in the brain, and thus

could play a role in the pathogenesis of
Parkinson’s disease.
Similar to classical genes, regions of the
genome that encode miRNAs are transcribed
in the cell nucleus. Nascent miRNA transcripts
are initially processed into long (up to several
kilobases in length) precursor miRNAs that
are then sequentially cleaved by two enzymes,
Drosha and Dicer, into small functional RNAs
(∼22 nucleotides). These miRNAs are subsequently incorporated into an RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC), which suppresses
the translation and/or promotes the degradation of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs)—
RNA molecules that encode proteins—by
binding to their 3'-untranslated regions
(3'-UTRs) (4). miRNAs are abundant in the
brain and are essential for efficient brain function. In this regard, expression of a brain-specific miRNA (miR-124a) in nonneuronal cells

Neuronal survival in the brain. An autoregulatory feedback loop composed of the transcription factor

miR-133b is deficient in the midbrain of Parkinson’s disease patients and in mouse models of dopamine
neuron deficiency.

Parkinson’s disease is profound given that
after Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease
is the second most prevalent age-associated
neurodegenerative disorder. The gradual loss
of dopaminergic (and eventually other) neurons results in severe mobility problems and
occasionally evolves into full-blown dementia. As with Alzheimer’s disease, gene mutations can result in inherited forms of Parkinson’s disease (9). Although the study of these
rare familial forms has helped enormously in
understanding their molecular pathogenesis,
the real challenge for future research in the
field is the vast number of nonfamilial cases.
The hypothesis that alterations in miRNA
networks in the brain contribute to neurodegenerative disease is appealing and has been tested

miRNAs, and the extent to which these
miRNAs play a relevant role in the neurodegenerative phenotype. The evidence presented by
Kim et al. is somewhat ambiguous as far as relevance to neurodegeneration. Screening the
expression of 224 different miRNAs obtained
from brain samples of patients with Parkinson’s
disease and control subjects revealed notable
changes in a small number of miRNAs,
including miR-133b. Normally, miR-133b is
enriched in the midbrain; however, it was surprisingly deficient in the brains of patients with
Parkinson’s disease. The relative number of
patients investigated in this study is too small to
draw definite conclusions about the clinical relevance of this observation. The finding that
miR-133b suppresses the full differentiation of

dopaminergic neurons in cell culture, whereas
its expression is down-regulated in the brain of
Parkinson’s disease patients, is, however, puzzling. This observation suggests that miR-133b
might have additional functions in dopaminergic neuronal differentiation beyond suppressing Pitx3 expression. Further work is necessary, not only to elaborate the clinical importance of these findings, but also to elucidate the
full genetic program that miR-133b modulates.
Apart from the possibility that an overall
loss of miRNA function could be associated
with aging and could contribute to the agerelated increased risk for Parkinson’s and
Alzheimer’s disease, very specific molecular
mechanisms should also be envisaged. Thus,
polymorphisms in the genetic regions encoding specific miRNAs and alterations in
molecular machinery (such as miRNAprocessing enzymes) should be investigated.
In particular, the 3'-UTR of the mRNAs
encoding proteins such as α-synuclein or
amyloid precursor protein should be scrutinized. Because dosage effects of these
proteins are sufficient to induce Parkinson’s
disease (13) and Alzheimer’s disease (14),
respectively, further alterations that control
their expression might also contribute to
pathogenesis. Indeed, the neurological disorder Tourette’s syndrome is associated with
a variation in the binding site for a specific
miRNA in the 3'-UTR of mRNAs encoding the neuronal proteins Slit and Trk-like 1
(SLITRK1) (15).
The work by Kim et al. and other recent
studies (7, 11) herald a new area of exciting
research in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical studies will rapidly determine
the extent to which miRNAs contribute to the
pathogenesis of sporadic Parkinson’s and
Alzheimer’s disease; however, the role of
miRNAs as a potential therapeutic target
remains a challenging question.
