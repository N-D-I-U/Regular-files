Comparing dopamine agonists in Parkinson’s disease
Ubaldo Bonuccelli
Summary
Dopamine agonists are effective in the management of both
advanced and early-stage Parkinson’s disease. Unfortunately,
randomized head-to-head comparative studies between the
many different dopamine agonists now available are sparse.
Indirect comparisons of dopamine agonists show that ergot
derivatives, such as pergolide and cabergoline, are as
effective as non-ergot derivatives, such as ropinirole and
pramipexole, in ameliorating Parkinson’s disease symptoms in
patients in early or advanced stages of the condition. As far
as safety and tolerability are concerned, no significant
differences between dopamine agonists are found. However,
some specific adverse events, such as somnolence and sleep
attacks, seem less frequent in monotherapy studies with
pergolide than in those with the non-ergot dopamine agonists; however, because of the lack of direct-comparison
studies this cannot be proved conclusively. Randomized,
controlled comparative studies between dopamine agonists
are necessary to verify any possible differences in their
effectiveness and tolerability in the treatment of Parkinson’s
disease.

Introduction
Dopamine agonists are highly effective as therapy adjunctive to levodopa (L-dopa) in advanced Parkinson’s disease,
and are rapidly gaining popularity as monotherapy in the
early stages of the illness. Since the introduction of
bromocriptine in the 1970s, the number of dopamine agonists has increased substantially and the clinician is now
presented with the fortunate dilemma of deciding which
one of several dopamine agonists to prescribe.
Choosing a dopamine agonist is far from straightforward.
There is no universally accepted first choice of
dopamine agonist, and prescribing decisions are usually
made on the basis of personal preference, experience
with a particular agent, or a desire (by the clinician or
patient) to try something new [1].
Differentiating between the dopamine agonists on the
basis of their pharmacokinetics and receptor pharmacology reveals intriguing differences (see the Jenner
review in this Supplement), which predict theoretical
differences in anti-parkinsonian activity or safety profiles
for each drug. But for the prescribing clinician, the real
interest is in seeing if, and how, these differences translate into therapeutic benefits for the patient.

Unfortunately, the comparative data on which prescribing decisions might be based are relatively sparse. Very
few controlled, well-designed studies directly comparing
the efficacy and safety of the various dopamine agonists
have been conducted [1]. Indirect comparisons of the
newer dopamine agonists such as pergolide, ropinirole,
cabergoline and pramipexole, based on recent randomized, controlled studies evaluating their efficacy as
monotherapy in early Parkinson’s disease, are hampered
by differences in study design, patient characteristics,
and concomitant anti-parkinsonian medications.
This review compares the efficacy and safety of the
newer dopamine agonists, both as adjunctive therapy
and as monotherapy in Parkinson’s disease.

Dopamine agonists as adjunctive therapy
The majority of direct-comparator studies use the earliest dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, as the standard
reference agent. This provides a useful way of comparing the effects of the dopamine agonists against each
other as adjunctive therapy.

Pergolide versus bromocriptine

There are six published studies that compare pergolide
with bromocriptine: four were performed in patients
with advanced Parkinson’s disease and motor fluctuations, and two included both newly diagnosed and
advanced patients (Table 1) [2–7]. In each of these
studies, pergolide showed equivalent or superior efficacy
relative to bromocriptine in terms of improvement in
parkinsonian disability, particularly in activities of daily
living and motor-examination scores [2–7].
A Cochrane database review of three short-term, randomized, controlled studies in which pergolide or bromocriptine was used as adjunctive therapy in patients with
advanced Parkinson’s disease confirmed the greater efficacy of pergolide [8]. Pergolide was superior to bromocriptine in improving parkinsonian motor impairment and
disability – as rated by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease
Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the New York University
Parkinson’s Disease Scale – and scores for the activities of
daily living. However, owing to a lack of data, no firm conclusions could be drawn regarding any reduction in
L-dopa-induced motor complications in this analysis [8].
In a separate study in 12 patients with advanced
Parkinson’s disease and fluctuating motor disability and
L-dopa-induced dyskinesias, pergolide significantly
lengthened the ‘on’ mobilization period and also
appeared to reduce the severity of onset and peak-dose
dyskinesias [9]. Using a variant of the standard L-dopa
test, patients receiving L-dopa were titrated to
bromocriptine (15 mg/day) or pergolide (1.5 mg/day) plus
the anti-emetic domperidone (30 mg/day) for 8 days,
after which they were given a fasting challenge of 150 or
200 mg L-dopa together with either 1 mg pergolide or
10 mg bromocriptine. Pergolide and bromocriptine both
produced similar improvements in motor disability, but
pergolide sustained the ‘on’ duration for significantly
longer than L-dopa alone or with bromocriptine [9].
Pramipexole versus bromocriptine

Pramipexole is a relatively ‘new’ non-ergot derivative
with affinity for D2 and D3 receptors; the significance of

the D3 receptor in Parkinson’s disease remains
unknown. Only one randomized, double-blind, controlled trial has compared pramipexole with bromocriptine, and involved 247 patients with advanced disease
and motor fluctuations [10]. In this study, both
pramipexole and bromocriptine improved ‘off’ time and
reduced parkinsonian motor impairments and disability
compared with a placebo. Unfortunately, this study was
not designed to examine the differences between active
treatment arms, so no conclusions could be drawn about
the comparative effectiveness and safety of the two
drugs [10,11].
Ropinirole versus bromocriptine

Three randomized studies – two double-blind studies
and one open-label switch study – compared the nonergot derivative ropinirole and bromocriptine in patients
with advanced or newly diagnosed Parkinson’s disease
(Table 2) [12–14]. In contrast to the findings with pergolide, the double-blind studies concluded that ropinirole was only similarly effective to bromocriptine; only
patients in the open-label study showed an improvement after switching to ropinirole [12–14]. A Cochrane
review of these studies showed that there were, in fact,
no significant differences between ropinirole and
bromocriptine in terms of reducing ‘off’ time, the L-dopa
dose, or the incidence of dyskinesias and other adverse
events (except for nausea, which was less frequent with
ropinirole) [15].
Cabergoline versus bromocriptine

Cabergoline is an ergot derivative like pergolide, but is
distinguished from the others in its class mainly by a
long half-life of around 65 h. One randomized, doubleblind, parallel group study of cabergoline versus
bromocriptine in patients with advanced disease and
fluctuating responses to L-dopa found that both drugs
were equally effective [16]. These findings were confirmed in a Cochrane review, which concluded that
cabergoline appeared to produce no significant reduction
in ‘off’ time in comparison with bromocriptine [17]. This
review found that there may even be a trend towards a
higher frequency of dopaminergic adverse events

know they are taking a new drug and consequently have
expectations of its efficacy.

When the results of all of these studies are summarized,
it is evident that pergolide showed superior efficacy relative to bromocriptine in reducing motor disability and
improving parkinsonian symptoms in a majority of
studies; the other dopamine agonists achieved efficacies
that were only similar to that of bromocriptine.

Pergolide versus ropinirole

Head-to-head comparisons

Direct comparisons of the dopamine agonists as adjuncts
to L-dopa therapy in head-to-head studies are few, but
those that exist are summarized below and in Table 3
[14,18–20].

In the only head-to-head comparison of pergolide and
ropinirole as adjunctive therapy in patients with
advanced Parkinson’s disease, pergolide was as effective
as the newer agonist. In this open-label switch study,
patients who were switched from bromocriptine to
ropinirole reported significant improvements in UPDRS
scores, but those who switched from pergolide to ropinirole showed no improvement. Instead, many patients,
after switching from pergolide to ropinirole, had to
return to pergolide treatment to regain efficacy [14].
Pergolide versus cabergoline

Pergolide versus pramipexole

Two small, open-label studies have compared the efficacy of pergolide with pramipexole as adjunctive therapy
in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. In the
first 8-week study by Goetz and colleagues [18] in 1999,
16 patients reported significantly lower UPDRS scores
after overnight switching from either pergolide or
bromocriptine to pramipexole.
In the second study, 25 patients with advanced Parkinson’s
disease and motor fluctuations converted from pergolide to
pramipexole over a longer 1-month period and continued
treatment for 6 months [19]. In this open study, although
subjective patient reporting showed that 62% felt they had
improved after the switch to pramipexole, there were no
significant differences in UPDRS scores between the two
drugs [19]. These findings show that the results of openlabel studies need to be interpreted with caution, especially if they rely on the subjective reports of patients who

In a single-blind, crossover study that compared pergolide with cabergoline in 48 patients with advanced
Parkinson’s disease, significant improvements in the
duration of ‘on’ and ‘off’ time were achieved for both
drugs compared to the baseline (P < 0.05), but, again,
there was no difference between treatments [20].
These direct comparisons clearly show that pergolide is
highly effective in improving motor function and parkinsonian symptoms in patients for whom L-dopa alone is
no longer effective. Moreover, its efficacy is at least comparable to that of the newer dopamine agonists.
No head-to-head studies directly compare all five
dopamine agonists with each other when used as
adjuncts to L-dopa. Indirect comparisons reveal no clear
‘leader’ among the dopamine agonists that could influence a choice made on the basis of efficacy alone; all of
the dopamine agonists demonstrate similar reductions in

Comparing the dopamine agonists as
monotherapy
There is now significant evidence supporting the use of
dopamine agonists as first-line monotherapy in newly
diagnosed patients [30]. However, in terms of efficacy,
again there is little to choose between the established
and newer dopamine agonists. In patients newly diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, pergolide, ropinirole and
pramipexole all produce comparable improvements (of
around 20–30%) in UPDRS-III scores (Fig. 3) [31–35].
Four major long-term studies with ropinirole, pramipexole, cabergoline and pergolide have evaluated the effects
of these dopamine agonists, in comparison with L-dopa,
in the prevention of motor complications in patients with
newly diagnosed Parkinson’s disease (Table 4) [36–39].
The findings show that all of them significantly reduced
the incidence of dyskinesias and/or motor fluctuations in
comparison with L-dopa (Fig. 4) [36–39]. In the
monotherapy study with pergolide, so far reported only
in abstract form [39], no other anti-parkinsonian medications or open L-dopa rescue were allowed. This is a significant variation in the protocol compared to the other
studies, making the results obtained with pergolide even
more compelling.
Comparison of the most frequent dopaminergic adverse
events in these studies shows that pramipexole and
ropinirole seem to be associated with higher frequencies
of somnolence and hallucination in comparison with
cabergoline and pergolide (Table 5) [36–39]; pergolide
was associated with a slightly higher frequency of nausea
than the other dopamine agonists. This side-effect can
be avoided by careful titration and, if necessary,

co-administration of an anti-emetic such as domperidone.
The finding of a lower incidence of somnolence with
pergolide monotheraphy might be, at least partially, due
to the fact that concomitant L-dopa was not administered. However, it could be particularly relevant given
the recent concerns raised over sudden onset of sleep
with dopamine agonists. The first report of nine cases of
sudden onset of sleep in Parkinson’s disease patients
taking ropinirole or pramipexole, described by Frucht et
al. in 1999 [40], was followed by an explosion of reports
of somnolence or sudden onset of sleep with other
dopamine agonists [41–47].

Excessive daytime sleepiness is common among
patients with Parkinson’s disease [48]. However, the
incidence of sudden onset of sleep, controversially
defined as an ‘event of overwhelming sleepiness that
occurs without warning’ [49], is relatively rare [48] but is
a concern, as these episodes might occur whilst the
subject is driving [40].
The precise relationship of the dopamine agonists to
sudden onset of sleep remains to be determined. As a
class, all of the dopamine agonists have a sedating, probably dose-related, effect [50], although agonists that activate the D2/D3 receptors (e.g. ropinirole and pramipexole)

may be more likely to induce irresistible somnolence than
those that stimulate the D1/D2 receptors [40].
Although fewer cases of sudden onset of sleep are
reported with pergolide than with other dopamine agonists, in recent epidemiological surveys no significant
difference between old and new dopamine agonists was
evident in terms of sleep attacks and daytime sleepiness
frequency [51].

Conclusion
Administered as adjuncts to L-dopa, all dopamine agonists offer patients significant improvements in motor

disability and parkinsonian symptoms when compared
with L-dopa alone, particularly in subjects with advanced
disease for whom L-dopa is becoming less effective. At the
doses used in published studies, adjunctive therapy with
pergolide produces the same improvements as the ‘newer’
dopamine agonists; the question of whether even greater
efficacy could be achieved if all patients were titrated to
higher daily pergolide doses remains an interesting one.

Similar equivalence in efficacy is seen when the
dopamine agonists are used as monotherapy. As a class,
the dopamine agonists appear to reduce the incidence of
dyskinesias significantly in comparison with L-dopa.
The L-dopa-sparing effects and the putative role as neuroprotective agents mean that the use of the dopamine
agonists as monotherapy in early-onset Parkinson’s
disease is rapidly expanding.

Although the efficacies of the different ergot and nonergot dopamine agonists in the treatment of Parkinson’s
disease seem largely similar, it is impossible, however, to
form any reasonable conclusions, especially between
pergolide and ‘newer’ compounds, such as cabergoline,
pramipexole and ropinirole, in the absence of direct,
head-to-head comparative studies.
As far as tolerability and safety are concerned, indirect
comparison between dopamine agonists is even more
difficult because of the different means of reporting and
collecting drug-related adverse events in different
studies. Amongst the very rare dopamine agonist-related
complications, there is compelling evidence that with
ergot compounds, such as bromocriptine and pergolide,
serosal fibrosis (retroperitoneal, pleural and pericardial
fibrosis) occurs more frequently than with the non-ergot
dopamine agonists [52]. This apparently higher incidence of fibrotic reactions during long-term treatment
with bromocriptine and pergolide may be biased by their
more worldwide availability and use resulting from the
longer period of time that has elapsed since their
approval for launch.
Clinicians are now in the enviable position of having a
wide range of effective dopamine agonists in their therapeutic arsenal, yet the task of choosing the most appropriate ones for their patients remains a core issue.
Prescribing decisions will continue to be made on the
basis of drug profiles and personal preference, and will
undoubtedly continue to be influenced by the quality of
the available data.
Further well-designed, controlled, head-to-head, comparative studies are needed to demonstrate whether a
difference between the many old and new dopamine
agonists now available for the treatment of Parkinson’s
disease does exist in terms of both efficacy and safety.
