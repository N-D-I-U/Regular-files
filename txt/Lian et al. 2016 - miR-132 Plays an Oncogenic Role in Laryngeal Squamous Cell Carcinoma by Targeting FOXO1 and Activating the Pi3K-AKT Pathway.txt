ABSTRACT

13

Increasing evidence indicates that the dysregulation of microRNAs is involved in tumor

14

progression and development. The purpose of the present study was to explore the expression

15

of microRNA-132 (miR-132) and its function in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC).

16

The results showed that miR-132 expression was markedly upregulated in LSCC tissues and

17

cell lines. Functional analyses indicated that overexpression of miR-132 enhanced cell

18

proliferation and tumor growth, which resulted in the downregulation of p27 and p21 and the

19

upregulation of cyclin D1. In addition, luciferase activity indicated that miR-132 directly
1

20

targets FOXO1, and inhibits FOXO1 protein expression in LSCC cells. Further studies

21

revealed that the ectopic expression of FOXO1 effectively reversed the cell growth induced

22

by miR-132. Moreover, miR-132 also activated the PI3K/AKT pathway, which further

23

decreased FOXO1 expression. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated that miR-132 plays

24

an important oncogenic role in LSCC by modulating the PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 pathway at

25

multiple levels, resulting in strong prognostic implication. Therefore, miR-132 might be a

26

potential therapeutic strategy in LSCC.

1. Introduction

30

Laryngeal carcinoma is one of the most common malignancy neoplasms of the head and

31

neck squamous cell carcinoma (Siegel et al., 2013). More than 90% of laryngeal tumors are

32

diagnosed as laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Although therapy approaches such

33

as surgery and radiotherapy have been improved in recent years (Hunter et al., 2005), the

34

overall 5-year survival rates for laryngeal carcinoma were less than 50% and still have not

35

been significantly improved over the past 30 years, mainly due to metastasis and recurrence

36

(Cosetti et al., 2008). Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the molecular

37

mechanisms responsible for LSCC metastasis.

38

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of approximately 22-nucleotide non-coding RNA

39

molecules, which have been identified as key negative regulators of gene expression through
2

40

the endogenous RNA interference machinery (Bartel, 2009; Chen and Rajewsky, 2007).

41

Accumulating evidence suggests that miRNAs play a role in diverse biological processes,

42

including proliferation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis (Krol et al., 2010). Recent studies have

43

also shown that dysregulation of miRNAs is implicated in invasion and metastasis in several

44

human cancer types, and laryngeal carcinoma is not an exception (Kalfert et al., 2015). These

45

studies suggest a critical role of miRNAs in tumorigenesis and development. Until now,

46

miRNAs have been identified as both tumor suppressors and oncogenes, which is dependent

47

on the role of their target genes.

48

An increasing number of studies has shown that lipid and protein phosphatase deregulation

49

plays an important role in cancer development and progression through the constitutive

50

activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog

51

(PI3K/AKT) signaling. There have been changes reported in the expression of many

52

oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in LSCC, such as p-AKT (JIA et al., 2009). These

53

changes could affect cancer development by modulating downstream signal transduction

54

pathways such as the well-known AKT signaling pathway (Knowles et al., 2011; Pedrero et

55

al., 2005). Therefore, a deeper understanding of these molecular mechanisms will help us to

56

identify new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to this disease and improve the prognosis

57

of LSCC patients. Human Forkhead box O (FOXO) proteins (FOXO1, FOXO3a, FOXO4,

58

and FOXO6) are key effectors of PI3K/Akt signaling and regulate many biological processes,

59

such as cell cycle regulation, cell differentiation, tumorigenesis, and oxidative stress

60

responses (Burgering and Medema, 2003; Carter and Brunet, 2007; Fu and Tindall, 2008).
3

61

Notably, FOXO1 is also a downstream molecule of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Activated AKT

62

phosphorylates FOXO1, which is subsequently exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm

63

and degraded by proteasomes (Zhao et al., 2004). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that

64

FOXO1 induces G1 phase cell-cycle arrest in glioma cells and renal cell carcinoma due to the

65

inhibition of tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten

66

(PTEN), via the upregulation of p27 (Kuo et al., 2013).

67

In the current study, we demonstrated that the expression of miR-132 was significantly

68

upregulated in LSCC cells, and acts as an important regulator in LSCC cell proliferation and

69

tumor growth. Furthermore, we investigated the role of miR-132 in modulation of the

70

PI3K/AKT pathway in LSCC cells, and discovered that FOXO1 is a novel direct target of

71

miR-132. Our findings demonstrated that miR-132 might be a novel target for further studies

72

into the therapy of laryngeal carcinoma.

73

2. Materials and Methods

74

2.1. Cell lines and human tissues

75

Two LSCC cell lines (Hep-2 and AMC-HN-8) and a normal human keratinocyte cell line

76

(HaCaT) were obtained from Shanghai Institute Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai,

77

China), maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and

78

100 μM each of penicillin and streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 at 37°C.

79

Human Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma specimens (n = 10) and corresponding adjacent

80

non-neoplastic tissues (n = 10) were obtained from patients of the Tianjin First Center
4

81

Hospital with documented informed consent in each case.

82

2.2. Transfection of miRNA mimics

83

The cells were placed in six-well plates (5 × 105 cells per well) in opti-MEM media

84

(Qiagen, Duesseldorf, Germany) and were transfected with miR-132 mimics using

85

Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The transfected cells were cultured for

86

6 h, and the culture medium was then replaced with fresh complete medium. The cells were

87

harvested 24 h after transfection.

88

2.3. RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR

89

Total RNA from cells was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies) according to the

90

manufacturer’s instructions. Messenger RNA (mRNA) and miRNA were polyadenylated

91

using a poly-A polymerase-based First-Strand Synthesis kit (TaKaRa Bio, DaLian, China)

92

and reverse transcription (RT) of total mRNA was performed using a PrimeScript RT Reagent

93

kit (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was

94

amplified and quantified on ABI 7500HT system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)

95

using SYBR Green I (Roche, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany). U6 or

96

glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were used as endogenous controls.

97

Relative fold expressions were calculated with the comparative threshold cycle (2-ΔΔCt)

98

method. The primer sequences showed in Table 1.

99

2.4. Western blotting
5

100

Forty-eight h after transfection, total protein was extracted from the Hep-2 cells using

101

RIPA cell lysis buffer containing proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors. The protein

102

concentration of cell lysates was quantified by BCA Kit. Equal quantities of protein was

103

separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF,

104

Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk diluted

105

with Tris Buffered Saline Tween-20 (TBST) (in mmol/L: Tris-HCl 20, NaCl 150, PH 7.5, 0.1%

106

Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h, and then probed with antibodies against p21, p27,

107

cyclin D1, FOXO1, pAKT, AKT, pPI3K, and PI3K (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,

108

MA, USA) at 4°C overnight. After extensive washing, the membranes were incubated with

109

secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (diluted

110

1:2,000; Amersham Biosciences, UK).The immunoblots were visualized using an enhanced

111

chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden).

112

2.5. MTT assay

113

Cell growth was measured by MTT assay, Hep-2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a

114

concentration of 103 cells/well. The cells were then maintained at 37°C for 24, 48, and 72 h

115

after transfection. The cells were treated with 100 μl 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-

116

2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) for 4 h at 37°C, followed by removal of the

117

culture medium and the addition of 150 μl DMSO. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured

118

in a Thermo Scientific Multiskan (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).

119

2.6. BrdU labelling
6

120

Cells grown on coverslips (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA,USA) at 70% confluence were incubated

121

with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 1 h. Cells were then stained with anti-BrdU antibody

122

(Upstate, Temecula, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Gray level

123

images were acquired under a laser scanning microscope (Axioskop 2 plus, Carl Zeiss Co.

124

Ltd., Jena, Germany).

125

2.7. Tumor xenografts

126

Stable cell lines with high expressions of miR-132 were established by transfecting Hep-2

127

cells with a miR-132 mimics, followed by selection for 28 days to obtain stable cell lines. Up

128

to 1×107 cells were mixed with matrigel (BD) and injected into athymic nude mice (six weeks

129

old). The mice were monitored and the tumor size was measured daily, and tumor volumes

130

were calculated as width (mm) × width (mm) × length (mm) × 0.5. The mice used in the

131

experiments were handled in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the

132

Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. After 28 days, the mice were killed.

133

2.8. Luciferase reporter assay

134

Cells were plated in 100-mm cell culture dishes, proliferating to 60-80% confluence after

135

24 h of culture. The reporter constructs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life

136

Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 12 h incubation, the

137

transfection medium was replaced; cells were harvested and washed with PBS, and lysed with

138

passive lysis buffer (Promega). The cell lysates were analyzed immediately using a 96-well
7

139

plate luminometer (Berthold Detection System, Pforzheim, Germany). Luciferase and Renilla

140

luciferase were measured using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega)

141

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The luciferase activity of each lysate was

142

normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. The relative transcriptional activity was converted

143

into fold induction above the vehicle control value.

144

2.9. Statistical analysis

145

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

146

All data displayed as the mean ± S.D.. Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA were performed

147

to analyze the significance of differences between sample means obtained from three

148

independent experiments. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

149

3. Results

150

3.1. Expression of miR-132 is upregulated in LSCC

151

To analyze the expression of miR-132 in LSCC, qRT-PCR was employed to quantify the

152

level of miR-132 in 10 pairs of LSCC tissues. As shown in Fig. 1A, miR-132 expression was

153

significantly higher in cancer tissues compared with their paired paracarcinoma tissues. These

154

results indicate that miR-132 expression is upregulated in human LSCC tissues. To determine

155

the levels of miR-132 in LSCC cells, two LSCC cell lines (Hep-2 and AMC-HN-8) and a

156

normal human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT) were used to detect the level of miR-132 by

157

real-time PCR. Our results demonstrated that the level of miR-132 was significantly increased

158

in Hep-2 and AMC-HN-8 compared to that in HaCaT, as shown in Fig. 1B. These results
8

159

indicate that upregulation of miR-132 may play an important role in LSCC development.

160

Hep-2 cells were used to study further. In addition, the results from real-time PCR analysis

161

showed that miR-132 displayed evident upregulation in miR-132 group compared to miR-NC

162

group. These results confirmed that we effectively overexpressed miR-132 expression in

163

Hep-2 cells (Fig. 1C).

164

3.2. MiR-132 upregulation promotes LSCC cell proliferation and modulated cell

165

cycle-related proteins

166

To evaluate the effect of miR-132 on cell proliferation of LSCC, the cells were transfected

167

with miR-132 mimics or miR-NC. The results showed that miR-132 upregulation strongly

168

raised the viabilities of Hep-2 cells (Fig. 2A). Additionally, we also observed that

169

overexpression of miR-132 enhanced cell proliferation, as assessed by the Brdu-ELISA assay

170

(Fig. 2B), showing a positive correlation with the MTT assays. Taken together, these findings

171

demonstrated that overexpression of miR-132 had a proliferation promotion effect on LSCC

172

cells.

173

As miR-132 evidently promoted cell proliferation of LSCC, we assumed that miR-132

174

could accelerate the cell cycle. To confirmed this hypothesis, we examined its functions

175

regarding the expression of genes which regulate the G1/S transition, including the

176

cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21 and p27, and the CDK regulator Cyclin D1.

177

Our results suggested that p21 and p27 were strikingly downregulated at both mRNA (Fig. 2C)

178

and protein (Fig. 2D) levels while cyclin D1 levels were markedly upregulated in

9

179

miR-132-overexpressing Hep-2 cells, compared to NC transfected cells. These results

180

provides further evidence that miR-132 plays an important role in LSCC cell proliferation.

181

Altogether, our results indicated that miR-132 functionally modulates cell cycle regulators,

182

p21, p27 and cyclin D1, thus making it relevant to cell proliferation and the cell cycle.

183

3.3. MiR-132 upregulation promotes LSCC tumorigenicity in vivo

184

To test whether miR-132 could enhance LSCC tumorigenesis, miR-132-overexpressing

185

and negative control cells were inoculated into nude mice. Tumors were measured daily in

186

two dimensions with calipers. The growth curve of tumor xenografts showed that the

187

over-expression of miR-132 significantly enhanced tumor growth compared with the negative

188

control (Fig. 2E). After 28 days, the mice were killed, and the tumors were removed. The

189

average weight of the tumors was measured, demonstrating that the high miR-132 markedly

190

increased the tumor weight compared to the negative control (Fig. 2F). These findings

191

indicated that the overexpression of miR-132 was able to promote LSCC growth.

192

3.4. FOXO1 is identified as a functional downstream target of miR-132

193

To investigate how miR-132 affects the development of LSCC, we searched for potential

194

regulatory targets of miR-132 using three prediction tools (miRanda, PicTar, and TargetScan),

195

and selected FOXO1 as a potential downstream target gene (Fig. 3A). To further examine the

196

effect of miR-143-3p on NFATc1 expression, we reexamined the effect of miR-132 on the

197

mRNA and protein expression of FOXO1. As shown in Fig. 3B and 3C, the upregulation of

198

miR-132 could significantly suppress both mRNA and protein level of FOXO1 expression
10

199

compared with the control group. Furthermore, we performed luciferase reporter assay to

200

further validate whether FOXO1 is a direct target of miR-132. The results showed that

201

miR-132 decreased luciferase activity with FOXO1 3’-UTR, but had no effect on luciferase

202

reporter with mutated miR-132- binding elements (Fig. 3D).

203

3.5. FOXO1 is involved in miR-132-induced cell proliferation of LSCC

204

As shown above, over-expression of miR-132 promoted proliferation of LSCC, to further

205

elucidate the function of FOXO1 in miR-132-mediated proliferation. We co-transfected

206

miR-132 mimics with FOXO1 over-expression vectors harboring no specific miR-132

207

binding sequences in the 3’-UTR. We also observed that the luciferase activity of the FOXO1

208

reporter was decreased in miR-132-overexpressing cells. The inhibitory effects of miR-132

209

could be abolished upon transfection with FOXO1 (Fig. 4A). In addition, the MTT assay

210

showed that the ectopic expression of FOXO1 effectively reversed the cell growth induced by

211

miR-132 overexpression (Fig. 4B). Thus, our results demonstrate that miR-132 was able to

212

enhance the proliferation of LSCC, at least in part, by the suppression of FOXO1.

213

3.6. MiR-132 activates the PI3K/AKT pathway in LSCC

214

FOXO1 transcription factor, a major PI3K-AKT downstream effector, regulates the

215

expression of genes that are critical for progress. Given that the expression of FOXO1 was

216

downregulated by miR-132 in LSCC. We hypothesized that miR-132 might modulate the

217

PI3K/AKT pathway by targeting FOXO1 downstream. As shown in Fig. 4C, miR-132

218

upregulation could activate AKT and PI3K activity, indicated by a decrease in phospho-AKT
11

219

and phospho-PI3K in Hep-2 cells. At the same time, the level of FOXO1 was decreased.

220

These results demonstrated that miR-132 activates the PI3K/AKT pathway in LSCC. To

221

further confirm whether overexpression of miR-132 promotes LSCC proliferation by

222

activating PI3K/AKT signaling, the cells were treated with an AKT inhibitor (MK-2206) and

223

a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002). The results demonstrated that LSCC cell proliferation was

224

dramatically suppressed (Fig. 4D). Together, these findings demonstrated that overexpression

225

of miR-132 augmented proliferation of Hep-2 cells through activating PI3K/Akt pathway.

226

4. Discussion

227

MiRNAs are naturally existing small non-coding RNAs which control the expression of a

228

large number of genes by binding to specific sites in the target mRNA, resulting in mRNA

229

cleavage/degradation or translational repression. Recent advances in the understanding of the

230

molecular mechanism of laryngeal cancer have revealed that multiple miRNAs play an

231

important role in laryngeal carcinogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism responsible

232

for miR-132 in laryngeal carcinogenesis remains unknown. Thus, in the present study, our

233

study revealed that the expressions of the miR-132 was markedly up-regulated in LSCC

234

tissues and cell lines. Additionally, ectopic expression of miR-132 enhanced cell proliferation

235

by blocking the G1/S-phase transition in vitro, and accelerated tumor growth. Collectively,

236

these findings indicated that miR-132 may have an essential role in the tumorigenesis and

237

progression of laryngeal cancer.

12

238

FOXO1 is a transcription factor for p27, p21, FasL, and Bim, which function as tumor

239

suppressors by blocking the G1/S transition and inducing apoptosis (Ho et al., 2008; Lam et

240

al., 2013). Despite mounting evidence of a tumor suppressive role for FOXO1, the

241

mechanism by which FOXO1 activity is regulated remains unclear. Recently, it has been

242

shown that FOXO1 activity is generally regulated by post-transcriptional modification rather

243

than genetic aberration (Haftmann et al., 2012; Mei et al., 2012). Other mechanisms reported

244

to be important for the regulation of FOXO1 are PI3K/AKT signaling and miRNA (Haftmann

245

et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2012). Among the miRNAs, miR-27a, miR-96, miR-182, and miR-183

246

suppressed FOXO1 expression in breast cancer, melanoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma

247

(Haftmann et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2012). However, the association between miR-132 and

248

FOXO1 expression has never been addressed. Thus, the identification of target genes may

249

elucidate miR-132 function and the molecular mechanisms by which it mediates LSCC

250

progression. Our study is the first to have identified FOXO1 as a genuine target of miR-132

251

by bioinformatics analysis, suggesting a crucial functional role of FOXO1 in larynx

252

carcinoma tumorigenesis.

253

A central transducer of growth and proliferative signaling, the PI3K/AKT signaling

254

pathway plays an essential role in maintaining tumor cell proliferation, and constitutive

255

activation of PI3K/AKT signaling is involved in the initiation and progression of various

256

human cancers, resulting in poor prognosis. It has been well documented that p21 (Tinkum et

257

al., 2013) and p27 (Cappellini et al., 2003) expression can be transcriptionally regulated by

258

FOXO1, and the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 is in turn modulated by AKT
13

259

phosphorylation (Hou et al., 2014). Several reports have demonstrated that PI3K/AKT

260

pathway alterations play an important role in the development of a variety of human

261

carcinomas. FOXO1 is key downstream factor for PI3K/Akt signaling and regulate many

262

biological processes. Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-132 might modulate the

263

PI3K/AKT pathway by targeting FOXO1 downstream. Our results revealed that miR-132

264

overexpression remarkably increased PI3K and Akt phosphorylation, and activates

265

PI3K/AKT signaling, while PI3K/AKT inhibitors suppressed the miR-132-induced

266

proliferation. In addition, we further demonstrated that miR-132 activated the PI3K/AKT

267

pathway by targeting FOXO1at the downstream level. These studies implicate miR-132 as an

268

oncogenic miR and indicate that miR-132 may have an important role in laryngeal cancer

269

development.

270

In conclusion, for the first time, the present study demonstrates that miR-132 is upregulated

271

in LSCC and over-expression of miR-132 promotes cell proliferation and tumor growth.

272

These findings also demonstrate a functional link between miR-132 and FOXO1 in LSCC,

273

indicating that FOXO1 may be a novel direct target of miR-132. This study demonstrated that

274

miR-132 downregulated FOXO1 in both direct and indirect manners by binding the 3’-UTR

275

of FOXO1 and by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway in LSCC. Based on all of the data, it

276

was inspiring to speculate that miR-132 could be a significant diagnostic and prognostic

277

biomarker for larynx carcinoma. Further exploration of the precise role of miR-132 in the

278

pathogenesis of a variety of tumors and in PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activation will

14

279

increase our knowledge of the molecular regulation of cancer progression and may allow the

280

development of new therapeutic strategies against larynx carcinoma.
