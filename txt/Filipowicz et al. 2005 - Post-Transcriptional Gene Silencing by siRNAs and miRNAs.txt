Post-transcriptional gene silencing by siRNAs and miRNAs
Witold Filipowicz, Lukasz Jaskiewicz, Fabrice A Kolb and
Ramesh S Pillai
Recent years have seen a rapid increase in our understanding
of how double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and 21- to 25-nucleotide
small RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs
(siRNAs), control gene expression in eukaryotes. This RNAmediated regulation generally results in sequence-specific
inhibition of gene expression; this can occur at levels as
different as chromatin modification and silencing, translational
repression and mRNA degradation. Many details of the
biogenesis and function of miRNAs and siRNAs, and of the
effector complexes with which they associate have been
elucidated. The first structural information on protein
components of the RNA interference (RNAi) and miRNA
machineries is emerging, and provides some insight into the
mechanism of RNA-silencing reactions.

Introduction
Research undertaken during the past decade with plants,
fungi, protozoa and metazoan animals has revealed several novel and evolutionarily conserved gene control
mechanisms that use double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
and 21- to 25-nucleotide (21–25-nt) small RNAs as
sequence-specific regulators. These reactions, often collectively referred to as RNA silencing, include RNA
interference (RNAi), RNAi-mediated chromatin silencing and DNA rearrangements, and post-transcriptional
regulation of mRNA by endogenously encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) (reviewed in [1–7]). During RNAi, the
dsRNA formed in cells by DNA- or RNA-dependent
synthesis of complementary strands, or introduced into
cells by viral infection or artificial expression is processed
to 20-bp double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) containing 2-nt 30 overhangs. The siRNAs are then
incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex
www.sciencedirect.com

(RISC), which mediates the degradation of mRNAs with
sequences fully complementary to the siRNA (Figure 1).
In another reaction, occurring in the nucleus, siRNAs
formed from repeat element transcripts and incorporated
into the RNAi-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS)
complex may guide chromatin modification and silencing.
The genetics and biochemistry of the latter process are
best characterized for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces
pombe and plants, but related reactions also operate in
other organisms [5,6].
miRNAs are a large family of 21-nt regulatory RNAs
expressed in metazoan animals and plants. They are
processed from endogenous precursor molecules, which
fold into dsRNA-like hairpins. With very few exceptions,
animal miRNAs regulate gene expression by base pairing
imperfectly to the 30 -untranslated region (30 -UTR) of
target mRNAs, inhibiting protein synthesis by an
unknown mechanism. By contrast, plant miRNAs generally show nearly precise complementarity to target
mRNAs and trigger mRNA degradation via a mechanism
similar to that operating during RNAi. Like siRNAs,
miRNAs form part of RISC-like ribonucleoprotein particles, miRNPs or miRISCs (Figure 1). There is partial
overlap in the protein composition of RISCs and miRNPs
(e.g. both complexes contain proteins of the Argonaute
family), consistent with the ability of miRNAs to act,
under some circumstances, as siRNAs and vice versa
[1,2,4].
This review summarizes recent (2003–2004) progress in
understanding the function of dsRNA and small 21–25-nt
RNAs in the post-transcriptional control of gene expression, focusing primarily on mechanistic and structural
aspects of regulation in animal cells. For extensive discussions of the role of the RNAi machinery in chromatin
modification and DNA rearrangements in protozoa, see
the reviews by Lippman and Martienssen [5], and Matzke
and Birchler [6]; RNA-silencing reactions in plants are
reviewed by Baulcombe [3].

Biogenesis of miRNAs
miRNAs are processed from precursor molecules, which
correspond either to transcripts of independent miRNA
genes or to fragments, most frequently originating from
introns, of protein-coding RNA polymerase II transcripts.
Several miRNAs, often structurally or functionally
related, can be co-transcribed [8]. Maturation of miRNAs
occurs in two steps, both catalyzed by enzymes of the
RNase III family, Drosha and Dicer. Droshas are 130–
160 kDa nuclear proteins containing two RNase III

miRNA biogenesis and post-transcriptional gene regulation by miRNAs and siRNAs. The pathway shown is primarily based on data from
Drosophila, although processing and assembly steps in mammalian cells are similar. Pri-miRNAs frequently contain more than one pre-miRNA
hairpin. The Dcr-2–R2D2 complex recognizes the thermodynamic asymmetry of siRNA, with Dcr-2 binding to the less stable end of the duplex,
near the 50 end of the selected guide strand. Rules of miRNA strand selection are similar, but details of the proteins involved are not known.
Although not absolutely required, Dcr-1 also plays a role in siRNA-dependent RNAi [20]. In mammals, a single Dicer participates in RNAi and
miRNA pathways, but whether the protein is part of the mature RISC/miRNP is not yet established. Drosophila Ago1 and Ago2 function in

Current Opinion in Structural Biology

Domain structures of proteins involved in the RNA-silencing pathways discussed in this review. Dicers and Droshas belong to the RNase III
family of proteins, and contain two RNase III catalytic domains (RIIIa and RIIIb) and a dsRBD (denoted by the asterisk). Dicers have an
N-terminal ATPase/RNA helicase domain, followed by a domain of unknown function (DUF283) and a PAZ domain, which is also present in
members of the Argonaute family. The two Drosophila (Dm) Dicers differ in functional domain composition: Dcr-1 contains only a C-terminal
part of the helicase domain, whereas the PAZ of Dcr-2 diverges from the domains found in other proteins. The Argonautes contain a
C-terminal Piwi domain that structurally resembles the RNase H fold. The Droshas have N-terminal proline-rich regions and the human (Hs)
enzyme has a domain rich in Arg-Ser (RS) dipeptides, similar to the protein–protein interaction domains found in many splicing factors.
Drosha and Dicer are assisted in their function by two proteins containing dsRBDs, Pasha and R2D2, respectively. The WW domain is a module
with two conserved tryptophan residues. Although WW modules generally interact with proline-rich sequences, the WW module of
Pasha/DGCR8 is dispensable for the interaction with Drosha [11]. Drosophila Ago2 is a considerably larger protein than Ago1 and human
Ago1–4, because it contains glutamine-rich repeats at its N terminus.

dimerization of its components [11] or the presence of
additional proteins. In human cells, Drosha also appears to
form part of a much larger multiprotein complex, but
whether this complex functions in the biogenesis of miRNAs or other RNAs is unclear [13]. Conceivably, as for
protein-coding transcripts, the synthesis and processing of
pri-miRNAs are tightly coordinated in the nucleus. Transsplicing may be important for effective processing of prilet-7 RNA in C. elegans [14]. Mammalian Drosha contains a
serine-arginine (SR)-rich region resembling protein–
protein interaction domains of the SR family of splicing
factors. However, such a domain is not present in the
Drosophila protein. Plant genomes do not seem to encode
Drosha homologs and, in Arabidopsis, all miRNA biogenesis steps may be carried out by one of the four Dicer-like
proteins, DCL-1, localized in the nucleus [15].

Function of Dicer
Following the nuclear maturation steps, the 70-nt premRNA hairpins are transported to the cytoplasm, in a
process mediated by exportin-5 (reviewed in [8]), where
they are further cleaved by Dicer to yield 20-bp miRNA
duplexes. Dicers are large 200 kDa proteins containing
www.sciencedirect.com

generally an ATPase/RNA helicase, DUF283, PAZ
domains, two catalytic RNase III domains (RIIIa and
RIIIb) and a C-terminal dsRBD (Figure 2). In addition
to excising miRNAs from pre-miRNAs, Dicer enzymes
process dsRNA to siRNAs. Vertebrates, C. elegans and S.
pombe contain single Dicer genes, whereas Drosophila,
Arabidopsis and some other organisms express two or more
Dicers with specialized functions (reviewed by Carmell
and Hannon [16]).
The Dicers of vertebrates and Drosophila are the best
characterized biochemically and genetically [7,16].
Recent analysis of mutants of purified recombinant
human Dicer led to a model of dsRNA and pre-miRNA
processing [17]. The enzyme functions as a monomer
containing a single processing center formed through
intramolecular dimerization of the two RNase III
domains of the same Dicer molecule. The center contains
two independent catalytic sites, each cutting one RNA
strand of the duplex and generating products with 2-nt 30
overhangs (Figure 3). Based on the crystal structure of the
catalytic domain of bacterial RNase III [18] and the
predicted substrate-docking site, each catalytic site

Model of Dicer function. (a) Scheme summarizing a possible mechanism of pre-miRNA processing by human Dicer. The helicase/ATPase and
DUF283 domains, with no assigned function, are delineated with a broken line. The enzyme contains a single dsRNA cleavage center with two
independent catalytic sites. The center is formed by the RIIIa and RIIIb domains of the same Dicer molecule, and processes the dsRNA 20 bp
from its terminus. The PAZ domain recognizes the 30 overhang end created by Drosha processing. The placement of the RIII domains illustrates
the asymmetry of the catalytic region, with RIIIa cleaving the descending arm and RIIIb the ascending arm of the pre-miRNA hairpin [17].
(b) Model of bacterial (Aquifex aeolicus) RNase III interaction with dsRNA. The model is based on a crystal structure of the catalytic domain
dimer [18] and the docking of the 30-bp dsRNA A helix, permitting cleavage of each RNA strand at phosphodiesters separated by 2 bp [17].
Two RNase III monomers are in different shades of purple. Mn2+ ions present in each catalytic center are shown as red spheres. The interaction
of dsRNA with the intramolecular pseudo-dimer of the Dicer RIIIa and RIIIb domains is very probably similar.

contains a single Mg2+ ion coordinated by four conserved
acidic amino acid residues. The Dicer mechanism is
similar to that proposed for bacterial RNase III [17]
(Figure 3). Dicer preferentially cuts dsRNAs at their
termini [16,19] and also excises miRNAs from the end
of pre-miRNA hairpins produced by Drosha [9,17].
The PAZ domain of Dicer is responsible for the recognition of termini with 30 overhangs (Figure 3), consistent
with similar RNA-binding properties of the PAZ domain
of Argonaute proteins (see below). Properties of Drosophila Dicer-2 (Dcr-2) mutants, assayed both in vivo and in
vitro, support the catalytic center model as outlined above
[20]. This work also demonstrated that Drosophila Dcr-2
requires a functional helicase for dsRNA processing in
vivo, consistent with the strong effect of ATP on the
activity of both Dcr-2 and C. elegans Dicer in vitro
[21,22]. By contrast, ATP has no effect on dsRNA
cleavage by either endogenous or recombinant human
Dicer [19]. Drosha may process its substrates using a
mechanism similar to that of Dicer. Like Dicer, Drosha
contains two RNase III catalytic domains (Figure 2),
which form an intramolecular dimer containing two catalytic sites functioning independently of each other [11].
Drosophila expresses two Dicers, Dcr-1 and Dcr-2, which
have subtle differences in the composition of their functional domains (Figure 2), but play very distinct roles in
Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2005, 15:331–341

RNA silencing. Dcr-1 mainly functions in the processing
of miRNA precursors, whereas Dcr-2 is required for
RNAi, both for the cleavage of dsRNA and for the
assembly of the RISC [20,23,24]. To perform the
latter function, Dcr-2 heterodimerizes with R2D2, a small
protein containing two dsRBDs [22]. Because vertebrates and C. elegans express only one Dicer protein,
interactions with additional proteins must modulate the
specificity of these enzymes. Indeed, an R2D2-like protein, RDE-4, which functions in a complex with Dicer,
the Argonaute protein RDE-1 and other proteins, and is
essential for RNAi but not miRNA function, has been
characterized in C. elegans [25]. Dicer proteins also interact
with Argonaute proteins [7,16], and regions responsible
for the direct interaction between human proteins have
been mapped to RNase III and Piwi domains [26,27].

Components of RNA-induced silencing
complexes
siRNAs and miRNAs function as components of ribonucleoprotein complexes, RISCs and miRNPs, respectively.
These complexes have been isolated from human and
Drosophila cells, and have also been identified in C. elegans
(reviewed in [7,28]). Apart from Argonautes, the only
proteins consistently found in all RISC and miRNP
forms, identified RISC components include the Vasa
intronic gene (VIG) protein, Tudor-SN (a protein
www.sciencedirect.com

siRNAs and miRNAs Filipowicz et al. 335

containing five staphylococcal/micrococcal nuclease [SN]
domains and a Tudor domain) and dFXR, the Drosophila
ortholog of human fragile X mental retardation protein
(FMRP) [7,28–30]. These proteins or their orthologs also
seem to form part of miRNPs from other organisms.
Additional associated proteins have also been identified.
In human cells, miRNAs were found in an 15S complex
containing Gemin 3 and Gemin 4 [31]; in Drosophila,
dFXR–miRNA complexes included ribosomal proteins
RPL5 and RPL11, and the RNA helicase Dmp68 [32].
The significance of the association with Gemins 3 and 4,
proteins also found in the SMN (survival of motor neurons) complex, which functions in the assembly of different cellular RNPs, is not understood, but interaction
with FXR1 or FMRP, RNA-binding proteins known to
act as modulators of translation, particularly in neurons,
may be related to the role of miRNAs in translational
repression (reviewed in [33]). The latter argument also
applies to the association with RPL5 and RPL11.

Structure and function of Argonaute proteins
A central role for Argonaute proteins in RNA silencing in
different organisms first emerged upon isolation of
mutants deficient in RNAi and related phenomena. Argonautes were then identified as components of RISCs and
miRNPs that associate with siRNAs or miRNAs, and as
proteins that interact with Dicer (reviewed in [7,34]). The
number of Argonaute paralogs in different organisms
ranges from 1 in S. pombe to 27 in C. elegans. The proteins
can be divided into two subfamilies, referred to as Ago

and Piwi. Humans, as with other mammals, contain four
Ago proteins, hAgo1–4, expressed ubiquitously, and four
Piwi family members of ill-defined function, expressed
only in testis and hematopoetic stem cells. Five Argonaute proteins are present in Drosophila, two of which,
Ago1 and Ago2, are best characterized in the context of
RNAi and miRNA pathways [7,34].
Recent structural studies of Ago proteins have greatly
advanced our understanding of RNA-silencing reactions.
Characteristic signatures of all eukaryotic Argonautes,
100 kDa highly basic proteins, are the PAZ and Piwi
domains, the former also found in Dicer proteins and the
latter unique to the Ago/Piwi family. Three-dimensional
structures of the 130 amino acid PAZ domains of
Drosophila Ago1 and Ago2 revealed that they contain
an oligonucleotide-binding (OB)-like nucleic-acid-binding fold [35–37]. These findings were soon followed by
structures of hAgo1 PAZ in complex with a 7-bp siRNAlike duplex with a 2-nt 30 overhang [38] and Drosophila
Ago2 PAZ complexed with single-stranded RNA or DNA
pentamers [39]. In the hAgo1 PAZ–RNA structure, the
2-nt overhang is inserted into a cleft positioned between a
b barrel and a-b modules (previously identified in protein-only structures). In the 7-bp A-form duplex, the
strand with an anchored 30 end is in contact with the
positively charged top of the b barrel and the C-terminal
tail of the PAZ domain [38] (Figure 4a). Notably, all
important protein contacts are with the phosphodiester
backbone, consistent with the largely sequence-

independent recognition of RNA during the reaction.
Solution structures of the Drosophila Ago2 PAZ complexes confirm the docking of two 30 -terminal nucleotides
in the cleft, which is lined with aromatic and hydrophobic
residues [39].
Eukaryotic Ago proteins and their isolated Piwi domains
are difficult to prepare in a recombinant purified form.
Help, rather unexpectedly, came from prokaryotes. The
genomes of a few archaea and eubacteria encode proteins
of unknown function but with identifiable Piwi domains.
Song et al. [40] and, shortly thereafter, Parker et al. [41]
reported the structures of two such proteins, PfAgo and
AfPiwi, originating from the archaeons Pyrococcus furiosus
and Achaeoglobus fulgidus, respectively. Three domains of
PfAgo, N-terminal, middle and Piwi, form a crescentshaped base, with a PAZ domain sitting in the middle of
the crescent above the Piwi domain (Figure 4b). The
sequence of PfAgo PAZ is poorly conserved and the
domain could only be recognized at the three-dimensional structure level. However, PfAgo PAZ contains
aromatic amino acids that are the equivalent of those
in eukaryotic proteins that bind the 30 overhang nucleotides of siRNA [40]. The second characterized protein,
427 amino acid AfPiwi, is smaller than PfAgo, and structurally corresponds to the PfAgo middle and Piwi
domains. In the AfPiwi structure, they are referred to
as domains A and B, and jointly as the Piwi fold [41]
(Figure 4b).
Most interestingly, the Piwi domains of PfAgo and AfPiwi
turned out to have a fold similar to that of RNase H, an
enzyme that cleaves the RNA strand of DNA–RNA
hybrids, arguing that the Piwi domain may represent
an elusive ‘Slicer’ that is responsible for mRNA cleavage
in RISCs [40,41]. RNase H and structurally related
enzymes contain a triad of acidic amino acids (DDE)
involved in catalysis. Equivalent amino acids appear to be
conserved in PfAgo and most eukaryotic Argonaute proteins. Mutagenesis of human Ago2, the only one of the
four mammalian Ago proteins able to support mRNA
degradation upon incorporation into the RISC, demonstrated that the two aspartates of the DDE triad are
indeed essential for mRNA cleavage ([42]; see also
Update). The similar metal ion requirements and chemistry of RNA cleavage of RNase H and the RISC (both
enzymes generate 50 -phosphate and 30 -OH termini)
[43,44], and the demonstration that Ago2 is the only
polypeptide present in the purified RISC of Drosophila
[45], further support a role for Argonaute as Slicer (see
also Update).

siRNA strand selection and RNA-induced
silencing complex assembly
The products of dsRNA and pre-miRNA processing by
Dicer are 20-bp duplexes with 30 overhangs. However,
miRNAs and siRNAs present in functional RISCs have to
Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2005, 15:331–341

be single stranded for pairing with the target RNA. How
are the duplexes converted to single-chain forms and how
is a correct (i.e. antisense or ‘guide’) strand selected for
loading onto the RISC? The latter question is of practical
importance because artificial siRNAs can be directly used
to trigger RNAi in order to knock-down genes. Measurements of the potency of different double- and singlestranded siRNAs (single-stranded siRNAs can induce
RNAi, although with much lower efficiency than duplex
forms), and sequence analysis of the duplexes formed by
pre-miRNA processing by Dicer have indicated that the
strand incorporated into the RISC or selected as an
miRNA is generally the one whose 50 terminus is the
thermodynamically less stable end of the duplex
[46,47]. Investigating the mechanism of RISC assembly on synthetic siRNAs, Tomari et al. [48] found that,
in Drosophila, the Dcr-2–R2D2 heterodimer senses the
differential stability of the duplex ends and determines
which siRNA strand gets selected. Photocross-linking to
siRNAs containing 5-iodouracils at different positions
demonstrated that Dicer binds to a less stable and
R2D2 to a more stable siRNA end.
Identification of the Dcr-2–R2D2–siRNA complex [22]
and use of Drosophila strains with mutations in RNAi
genes helped considerably in dissecting RISC assembly
(reviewed in [28]). ATP-independent formation of the
Dcr-2–R2D2–siRNA complex clearly represents an early
step in the pathway. The complex probably positioned
immediately downstream is the RISC loading complex,
RLC. This contains additional unidentified proteins and
its formation requires ATP. siRNA unwinding is initiated
within the RLC and the process requires functional Ago2,
which gradually displaces the Dcr-2–R2D2 heterodimer,
as monitored by photocross-linking of proteins to RNA.
The Dcr-2–R2D2–siRNA complex and the RLC are true
assembly intermediates; both can be ‘chased’ into the
active RISC [23,24,48].
Functional RISCs able to cleave mRNA targets have
been isolated in distinct forms with varying size and
protein composition [7,28]. This may reflect their functional heterogeneity, but may also be due to differences in
preparatory procedures. ‘Minimal’ active RISCs of 100–
160 kDa may contain only Ago proteins associated with
siRNAs [45,49], consistent with the notion that Argonautes catalyze mRNA cleavage. The largest complex, a
holo-RISC identified in Drosophila, sediments on gradients at 80S [23] and probably corresponds to the
ribosome-associated form of previously characterized
300–500 kDa RISCs [29,30,50]. Proteins cofractionating
with the holo-RISC, in addition to VIG, Tudor-SN,
dFXR and Ago2, also include Dcr-2 and R2D2, indicating
that these early siRNA-loading factors may have additional, still unidentified, functions in the RISC
[23,24]. Within the RISC, mRNA cleavage occurs
between the residues that are base paired to nucleotides

10 and 11 of the siRNA, counting from its 50 end [51], and
cleavage itself does not require ATP [7,24,50]. The
guide siRNA remains associated with the complex, allowing it to carry out multiple rounds of RNA cleavage. The
turnover of the enzyme is dependent on ATP, suggesting
that release of the cleaved mRNA halves may involve an
RNA helicase [28,52,53]. Several proteins implicated
in RNAi in Drosophila and other organisms contain
ATPase/RNA helicase domains, consistent with a
requirement for ATP at different steps of the reaction
[50]. However, which proteins participate in specific steps
of RNAi is not yet established. Armitage, identified in
Drosophila, is perhaps the best candidate for unwinding
siRNAs, as extracts from armitage mutants are defective in
steps downstream of Dcr-2–R2D2–siRNA complex
assembly [24].
The two Drosophila Dicers, Dcr-1 and Dcr-2, are not the
only proteins with roles dedicated to either miRNA or
RNAi pathways. In Drosophila, the primary function of
Ago1 is in the miRNA pathway, whereas that of Ago2 is
mainly confined to RNAi [29,54]; Ago proteins also have
specialized functions in C. elegans [55]. Of the four human
Ago proteins, hAgo1–4, only complexes incorporating
either endogenous or recombinant hAgo2 are able to
cleave mRNA targets [42,53]. Consistently, mouse
Ago2 knockout cells are resistant to induction of the
RNAi response [42]. On the other hand, all mammalian
Ago proteins associate with endogenous miRNAs
and appear to function in translational repression [42,
53,56]. The inability of mammalian Ago1 and Ago3 to
act as a Slicer is puzzling, because, like hAgo2, these
proteins contain the conserved DDE triad. Subtle differences in amino acids other than DDE are probably
responsible for the inactivity of hAgo1 and hAgo3
([42]; see also Update).

Function of miRNAs
In contrast to the assembly of the mRNA-cleaving
RISCs, relatively little is known about the assembly of
functional miRNPs. However, the disposition of miRNA
within the mature complex must be similar to that of
siRNA within RISCs, because endogenous miRNPs
can cleave RNA when confronted with targets perfectly
complementary to the miRNA. Moreover, vertebrate
miRNA miR-196 [57] and most known plant miRNAs
[2,3] function by cleaving target mRNAs. Initial studies
in C. elegans indicated that miRNAs downregulate protein
accumulation without affecting the mRNA level and
mRNA association with polysomes, suggesting that translation is either repressed at the step downstream of
initiation or that proteins actually undergo synthesis
but are rapidly degraded [1,2,58]. In Drosophila and
mammalian cells also, the decrease in protein accumulation occurs without mRNA degradation [59–62]. The
repressive effect of miRNAs can be mimicked in HeLa
cells by the miRNA-independent tethering of human
www.sciencedirect.com

Argonautes hAgo2–4 to the mRNA reporter, showing that
a major function of miRNAs is to guide their associated
proteins to the mRNA [56]. These data also indicate that
a default effect of depositing Ago proteins, including
hAgo2 Slicer, on mRNA is translational repression, with
cleavage requiring proper base pairing of guide and target
RNAs.
Two major characteristics of animal miRNA–mRNA
interactions, established by experimental and bioinformatics approaches, are contiguous Watson–Crick base
pairing in the miRNA 50 -proximal seed region and a lack
of complementarity in a central part of the miRNA
[2,63,64,65]. Whereas one perfectly complementary site
is sufficient for siRNA- (or miRNA-) induced target RNA
cleavage, effective translational repression of mRNA
usually requires multiple imperfect sites recognized by
the same or several different miRNAs [60,63] (for a
discussion of exceptions to this generalization, see
[65]). The molecular basis of this apparent miRNP
cooperativity remains unknown.
Although none of the known signatures of Argonaute
proteins provides any clue as to their possible role in
effecting translational repression, one of the many proteins that associates with Argonautes and miRNAs,
FMRP/dFXR [29,32], is a possible candidate for mediating at least some translational repression functions.
FMRP is known to act as a regulator of mRNA translation,
and is strongly implicated in promoting synaptic maturation and function. Notably, FMRP is most abundant in
brain and a large number of miRNAs are also specifically
expressed in this tissue [4,33].

Proteins regulating RNA silencing
Studies of RNA silencing in different organisms have
revealed its important role in taming transposon movement, in antiviral defense and in control of gene expression at different levels. Not surprisingly then, RNAi and
miRNA reactions are frequently subject to elaborate
regulation. For example, many plant [3] and some
animal [66,67] viruses encode suppressors of post-transcriptional RNA silencing that interfere with the accumulation or function of siRNAs. Recent crystallographic
studies have revealed how the p19 suppressor protein of
Tombusviridae elegantly and effectively sequesters
siRNAs aimed at destroying viral RNA [68,69]. In
the structures, two pairs of tryptophan residues of the
p19 dimer are positioned on both sides of the siRNA
duplex, stacking on the top of terminal base pairs and
measuring the distance between the ends of the RNA
duplex (Figure 5). As a consequence, only 19–21-bp
siRNAs are efficiently bound, independent of the presence of 30 overhangs. Most of the protein contacts occur
with the backbone phosphates and sugar 20 -OH groups
of the RNA, thereby explaining the absence of sequence
specificity.

surface interacting with the shallow minor groove of the RNA helix. Two
pairs of tryptophan residues, shown as red sticks, are positioned on both
sides of the siRNA duplex, stacking on the top of terminal base pairs.
p19 monomers are colored light and dark blue.

Genetic screens in C. elegans identified two proteins, ERI1 and RRF-3, mutations in which strongly enhance RNAi.
ERI-1 contains a conserved DEDDh-like motif also
found in 30 ! 50 exonucleases, and the C. elegans protein
and its human ortholog degrade siRNAs in vitro in a
reaction dependent on 30 overhangs [70]. ERI-1 is highly
expressed in neurons and may be responsible for the
relative inefficiency of RNAi in these cells. rrf-3 encodes
one of the four putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) of C. elegans [71]. RdRPs are essential
for many forms of RNA silencing in plants, worms and
Neurospora crassa, and are also implicated in amplification
and spreading of the RNAi response [3]. The inhibitory
effect of RRF-3 on RNAi is most readily explained by the
protein being a defective enzyme, acting as a dominant
negative factor [71].

Conclusions and prospects
The discovery of RNA-guided silencing mechanisms
revolutionized our understanding of the control of gene
expression and emphasized once more the crucial regulatory role played by RNA. During the past 5–6 years,
Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2005, 15:331–341

intensive genetic, biochemical and computational
approaches have cataloged hundreds of different players,
both proteins and RNAs, that take part in the small RNA
games. First high-resolution structures have also
appeared, providing some mechanistic understanding of
the reactions. The breadth of small-RNA-mediated regulation was not anticipated. Current predictions put the
number of different mammalian miRNAs at 500 or more
[72] and the percentage of genes regulated by them is
placed at 25–30% [73]. miRNAs encoded in viral genomes, probably regulating both viral and host gene
expression, have also been reported [74]. Moreover,
recent experiments indicate that mammalian miRNAs
can reduce the levels of many of their target mRNAs that
do not have fully complementary sites [75].
New modes of biogenesis of small RNA regulators are
emerging, as exemplified by the endogenous trans-acting
siRNAs processed from double-stranded forms of noncoding RNAs expressed in plants [76,77]. Single dsRNA
of this kind, probably formed by the action of RdRPs, can
give rise to multiple siRNAs targeting many different
genes. Equally intriguing is the identification in C. elegans
of hundreds of endogenous siRNAs precisely complementary to protein-coding regions of 500 different
genes, arguing that regulation of endogenous genes by
RNAi is also common in animals [78]. New connections
between RNA silencing and epigenetic mechanisms, a
topic only briefly mentioned in this review, are also
emerging. Identification of the plant miRNA that guides
gene-specific DNA methylation in Arabidopsis by associating with the nascent mRNA transcript in the nucleus,
and of an additional RNA polymerase (Pol IV) involved in
siRNA-mediated silencing of transposons and repetitive
DNA in plants are just two examples of the progress in
this area [79,80]. Without doubt, small RNAs will continue to surprise us for many years to come.

Update
Three recent papers provide important additional information about the structure and function of Argonaute
proteins. Parker et al. [81] and Ma et al. [82] solved the
structure of AfPiwi complexed with siRNA mimics. In the
structure, the phosphorylated 50 -terminal nucleotide of
the guide strand is non-base-paired to the complementary
strand and is anchored, in the ‘flipped’ conformation,
within the highly conserved basic pocket of the protein.
The additional identified siRNA–Piwi contacts involve
the sugar-phosphate backbone of four 50 -proximal nucleotides (positions 2–5) of the guide strand. Presentation of
these nucleotides on the Piwi surface in a quasi-helical
form suitable for base pairing is consistent with the 50 end
of both miRNAs and siRNAs representing a nucleation
region for pairing with target mRNAs. Modeling longer
A-form helices into the AfPiwi structures placed the mRNA
target scissile phosphate in proximity to the proposed
catalytic region. Hence, the data reinforce the idea that
www.sciencedirect.com

siRNAs and miRNAs Filipowicz et al. 339

the mRNA cleavage site is determined by measuring the
fixed distance from the anchored siRNA 50 end. This
conclusion is also supported by the work of Rivas et al.
[83]. These authors found that an active RISC can be
reconstituted from bacterially expressed human Ago2 and
an siRNA. When siRNAs shorter than 21 nt were used for
RISC assembly, the cleavage site of the substrate was
shifted by precisely the number of bases removed from
the siRNA 50 end. Reconstitution of the active RISC with
a recombinant hAgo2 represents a final proof that Argonaute is indeed a catalytic engine of the RISC. However,
mutagenesis indicates that a DDH rather than DDE triad
of amino acids is required for catalysis by the recombinant
hAgo2.
The assembly and activity of RISC and RISC-like complexes are also reviewed in a recent article by Tomari and
Zamore [84].

Nature 2005, 434:663-666.
This paper, together with [82], reports the structure of the archaeal Piwi
protein complexed with siRNA mimics. The structures identify a highly
conserved basic pocket, which serves as an anchor site for the phosphorylated 50 -terminal nucleotide of the siRNA guide strand. The identified siRNA–Piwi contacts also involve four additional 50 -proximal
nucleotides (positions 2–5) of the guide strand, consistent with the 50
end of both miRNAs and siRNAs representing a nucleation region for
pairing with target mRNAs.

recombinant human RISC. Nat Struct Mol Biol 2005, 12:340-349.
This paper describes the reconstitution of an active RISC from bacterially
expressed human Ago2 and an siRNA. This represents a final proof that
Argonaute is indeed a catalytic engine of the RISC. Mutagenesis of the
recombinant hAgo2 indicated that a DDH rather than DDE triad of amino
acids is required for catalysis.
