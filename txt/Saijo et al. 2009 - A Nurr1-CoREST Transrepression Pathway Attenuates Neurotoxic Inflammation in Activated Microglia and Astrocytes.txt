Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Nurr1, an orphan nuclear receptor, plays an essential role in the generation and maintenance of
dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Rare mutations in Nurr1 are associated with familial Parkinson’s
disease, but the underlying basis for this relationship has not been established. Here, we demonstrate
that Nurr1 unexpectedly functions to inhibit expression of pro-inflammatory neurotoxic mediators
in both microglia and astrocytes. Reduced Nurr1 expression results in exaggerated inflammatory
responses in microglia that are further amplified by astrocytes, leading to the production of factors
that cause death of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons. Nurr1 exerts anti-inflammatory effects
by docking to NF-κB-p65 on target inflammatory gene promoters in a signal-dependent manner.
Subsequently, Nurr1 recruits the CoREST corepressor complex, resulting in clearance of NF-κBp65 and transcriptional repression. These studies suggest that Nurr1 protects against loss of
dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson’s disease in part by limiting the production of neurotoxic
mediators by microglia and astrocytes.

INTRODUCTION
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most prevalent movement disorder among people over 65 years
old. Denervation of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) results in severely
debilitating motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor and rigidity (Farrer, 2006;
Fearnley and Lees, 1991). Although the etiologies of most common forms of PD remain poorly
understood, the disease is generally associated with an inflammatory component that is

manifested in part by the presence of activated microglia (central nervous system-resident
macrophages) and elevated serum or cerebrospinal fluid levels of pro-inflammatory factors
(Block et al., 2007; McGeer and McGeer, 2008; Nagatsu and Sawada, 2005). Several lines of
evidence suggest that inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, nitric
oxide (NO) and Interleukin (IL)-1β derived from non-neuronal cells, including microglia,
modulate the progression of PD (Brown, 2007; Hartmann et al., 2003; Whitton, 2007). Whether
inflammation is an initiating factor of PD in humans is unclear, but intracranial infusion of
bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a ligand for Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 and a potent
activator of microglia, is sufficient to induce the loss of TH+ neurons in rodents (Meredith et
al., 2008). LPS-induced inflammation can also synergize with α-Synuclein and Parkin
mutations associated with familial PD to potentiate the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+
neurons in animal models (Frank-Cannon et al., 2008; Gao et al., 2008). These observations
are consistent with the possibility that environmental factors, such as infection, may interact
with common but less penetrant susceptibility genes to influence the onset of most commonly
observed sporadic PD cases (Tansey et al., 2007).

TLRs induce inflammatory gene expression by regulating the activities and expression of
signal-dependent transcription factors that include members of the NF-κB, AP-1 and IRF
families (Kawai and Akira, 2007). The TLRs play essential roles in innate immune responses
to microbial pathogens based on their ability to recognize pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (Akira et al., 2006; Medzhitov, 2007). More recently, genetic loss-of-function
experiments in mice have shown that TLRs contribute to the pathogenesis of a number of
diseases in which inflammation is known to play a pathogenic role, including atherosclerosis,
inflammatory bowel disease, and liver fibrosis (Atkinson, 2008). These results are consistent
with TLRs being able to signal in response to the generation of endogenously derived ligands,
such as components of necrotic cells.
Nurr1 (NR4A2) belongs to the nuclear receptor (NR)4 family of orphan nuclear receptors and
is known to function as a constitutively active transcription factor by binding to target genes
as a monomer, homodimer or heterodimer with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (Aarnisalo et al.,
2002; Maira et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2003). Deletion of the Nurr1 gene in mice results in a
severe reduction in dopaminergic neurons and perinatal lethality (Zetterstrom et al., 1997),
consistent with an essential role for Nurr1 in the development and/or maintenance of
dopaminergic neurons. Human mutations resulting in reduced expression of Nurr1 are
associated with late-onset familial PD (Le et al., 2003), indicating that Nurr1 may play a
protective role.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Nurr1 is also expressed in non-neuronal cell types and Nurr1 mRNA is induced by
inflammatory stimuli, including LPS, in macrophages (Barish et al., 2005; Pei et al., 2005).
Intriguingly, recent observations suggest that members of the NR4 family can function as both
activators and repressors of cell type-specific inflammatory responses. For instance, Nurr1
suppresses expression of inflammatory response genes in human macrophages that are
implicated in the development of arthrosclerosis (Bonta et al., 2006). In contrast, Nurr1
promotes the development of mouse and human Th17 T cells that contribute to the pathogenesis
of multiple sclerosis (Doi et al., 2008). However, the molecular mechanisms by which Nurr1
controls transcriptional activation or repression of inflammatory responses have not been
established, and the potential impact of Nurr1 function on the inflammatory component of PD
has not been evaluated.
Here, we present evidence that Nurr1 plays an essential role in both microglia and astrocytes
as a signal-dependent transcriptional repressor of genes that encode pro-inflammatory
neurotoxic factors. Nurr1 functions as a key component of a negative feedback loop in both
microglia and astrocytes by recruiting CoREST co-repressor complexes to NF-κB target genes.

CoREST complexes, in turn, mediate the turnover of NF-κB and restore activated gene
expression to a basal state. Loss of Nurr1 function in extraneuronal cells of the SN results in
exaggerated and prolonged inflammatory responses that accelerate the loss of dopaminergic
neurons in response to LPS or overexpression of a mutant form of α-Synuclein (A30P)
associated with familial PD (Kruger et. al., 1998).

RESULTS
Nurr1 protects TH+ neurons from LPS-induced inflammation in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Studies demonstrating that Nurr1 mRNA is upregulated by LPS in macrophages (Barish et al.,
2005; Pei et al., 2005) raised the question of whether it might also be expressed in non-neuronal
cells and influence the development of PD. Analysis of Nurr1 protein and mRNA levels in
primary human and mouse microglia, primary human astrocytes, and the BV2 microglia cell
line demonstrated significant protein expression under basal conditions and induction of Nurr1
mRNA in microglia in response to LPS (Fig. S1A–E and data not shown). Similarly, Nurr1
protein colocalized with the microglia marker F4/80 (Fig. S2E) and Nurr1 mRNA was induced
approximately 2-fold in the SN 6h following stereotaxic injection of LPS (Fig. S1F). To
investigate the potential role of Nurr1 in PD pathology, we evaluated the impact of reducing
Nurr1 expression. Since Nurr1-deficient mice die shortly after birth, we performed stereotaxic
injections of lentiviruses encoding two independent shRNAs against Nurr1 (shNurr1-1 and
shNurr1-2) or control shRNA (shCtrl) into the SN of adult wild-type mice (Fig S2A). shNurr1-1
and -2 efficiently and specifically reduced Nurr1 mRNA and protein expression in the SN, as
determined by qPCR and immunostaining (Fig. S2B–E). A comparison of lentivirus-directed
GFP expression with cell-specific markers indicated preferential transduction of non-neuronal
cells, including microglia and astrocytes (Fig. S2G). The lentiviral injection was followed two
days later by injection of LPS into the same coordinates. We then analyzed the magnitude of
the inflammatory response by qPCR 6h after LPS injection and quantified TH+ neurons by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) 7 days after LPS injection.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Loss of TH+ neurons following LPS injection normally takes 2–3 weeks (Meredith et al.,
2008). However, stereological analysis revealed a significant decrease in TH+ neurons in the
SN of shNurr1 lentivirus-injected mice compared to shCtrl-injected animals after only 7 days
of LPS treatment (Fig. 1A and B). Interestingly, a pathological morphology of TH+ neurons
with reduced or absent processes and alterations in the size and shape of the cells was observed
more often in the shNurr1 groups (Supp Fig. 2E and Fig. 1B). In addition, pathological TH+
cells were observed close to activated microglia (Fig. S2F). The accelerated loss of TH+
neurons following Nurr1 knockdown required LPS injection, as it was not observed in buffer
(PBS)-injected animals (Fig. 1C and D). In addition, LPS injection was associated with
detection of caspase-3 cleavage, suggesting that loss of TH+ cells was due to cell death rather
than to loss of TH expression (Fig. S2G) (Sakurada et al., 1999). Reduction of Nurr1 expression
in the SN also resulted in exaggerated expression of inflammatory mediators in response to
LPS injection, including iNOS, TNFα and IL1β (Fig. 1E–G).
We also examined whether Nurr1 exerted neuro-protective effects in the context of
overexpression of an α– Synuclein mutant (A30P) associated with familial PD by combining
stereotaxic injection of shNurr1- or shCtrl-lentivirus with a lentivirus encoding mutant α –
Synuclein (A30P). A30P expression alone caused weak inflammation in the SN, whereas
reduction of Nurr1 expression in the context of A30P expression resulted in a dramatic increase
in expression of numerous inflammatory response genes, including TNFα and IL1β, and
significant loss of TH+ neurons (Fig. S3A–C and data not shown). In concert, these experiments
indicate that Nurr1 limits inflammatory responses in the CNS and protects TH+ neurons from
LPS- and α-Synuclein (A30P)-induced toxicity.

Glia-mediated inflammation contributes to the death of TH+ neurons

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To define the cell types responsible for LPS-mediated inflammation in the SN, we evaluated
the responses of human and mouse microglia, astrocytes and neurons to LPS. These
experiments demonstrated that microglia are orders of magnitude more responsive than
astrocytes or neurons, exemplified by the pattern of TNFα induction in primary mouse and
human microglia and astrocytes and the neuronal Neuro 2A (mouse neuroblastoma) cell line
(Fig. 2A, Fig. S4F). These results are consistent with the expression patterns of TLR4, coreceptors and down-stream signaling molecules in neurons and glial cells (Fig. S4A–E).
Although, TLR4 expression was virtually absent from the neuronal cell lines examined, we
tested whether LPS could directly induce the death of these cells. Three different neuronal cell
lines, Neuro2A, SK-N-SH and PC12, were incubated with LPS for 24h. No significant cell
death was observed by TUNEL assay or caspase-3 cleavage, in contrast to the effects of
TNFα plus cyclohexamide (CHX) treatment (Fig. 2B and Fig. S4G). In addition, knockdown
of Nurr1 in Neuro2A cells did not increase the sensitivity to LPS or death signaling (TNFα
plus CHX) as determined by TUNEL assay (Fig. 2C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Based on these results, we evaluated the consequences of reducing Nurr1 expression in
microglia on LPS responses. Knockdown of Nurr1 expression in BV2 microglia using specific
lentivirus-encoded shRNAs led to significant increases in LPS-dependent expression of
inflammatory mediators, including TNFα, iNOS and IL-1β (Fig. 2D-F). Similar results were
observed in the primary mouse (Fig. S5 and S6A-C) and human (data not shown) microglia.
To explore whether loss of Nurr1 in microglia resulted in secretion of mediators exhibiting
preferential toxicity for TH+ neurons, we knocked down Nurr1 expression using lentivirusencoded shRNAs in BV2 cells and tested the activity of conditioned media (CM) after LPS
stimulation on in vitro differentiated neurons and glial cells derived from mouse neuronal stem
cells (NSC). CM from shNurr1-BV2 cells resulted in the death of nearly all TH+ neurons, with
a significantly smaller effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-positive neurons and no
significant effect on glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astroglial cells (Fig. 2G–I).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Experiments using neuron and glia co-culture in vitro suggest that activation of innate
immunity in the CNS can trigger neuronal death (Lehnardt et al., 2003). Since NSC-derived
neurons always co-exist with astrocytes, it is possible that astrocytes contributed to the
neurotoxic effect of the microglia CM. To explore this possibility, we performed sequential
CM experiments employing isolated primary microglia and astrocytes and using Neuro2A cells
as a read-out for neurotoxicity. Primary murine astrocytes and microglia were infected with
shCtrl- or shNurr1-lentivirus used for the injection into the SN. Cells were then stimulated with
LPS and CM was harvested as described in Figure 2G. CM of microglia infected with shNurr1
induced significant cell death in Neuro2A cultures, whereas CM of astrocytes infected with
shNurr1 had much less effect on the death of Neuro2A cells. Intriguingly, sequential
conditioning of media from microglia to astrocytes indicated that astrocytes significantly
amplified the production of neurotoxic factors when exposed to microglia-conditioned media
(Fig. 2J lane 2 to lane 6 and 7). This effect was further increased when expression of Nurr1
was reduced in astrocytes (Fig. 2J lane 3 to lane 8 and 9). We conclude that microglia are the
initial responders to LPS-mediated inflammation and that astrocytes amplify the production of
neurotoxic factors after the microglial activation. The knockdown of Nurr1 in either microglia
or astrocytes increases the toxicity of CM, suggesting that Nurr1 inhibits the production of
neurotoxic factors in both cell types.
Nurr1-mediated transrepression requires GSK3β-dependent recruitment of Nurr1 monomers
to p65
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments indicated that Nurr1 was recruited to
LPS-responsive promoters following LPS treatment, exemplified by the TNFα promoter (Fig.

3A), suggesting that it was acting locally to repress transcription. Two different general
mechanisms of NR-mediated repression have been described: active repression, involving
sequence-specific DNA binding, and transrepression, involving tethering of NRs to negatively
regulated target genes via protein-protein interactions (Glass and Ogawa, 2006). A mutant of
Nurr1 (Nurr1C280A/E281A, CEAA), defective for sequence-specific DNA binding and unable
to activate NGFI-B responsive element (NBRE)-luciferase, a reporter for Nurr1 monomerbinding, was fully able to repress iNOS induction by LPS (Fig. 3B and Fig. S6D). In addition,
mutations directed at the heterodimerization (I-box) domain (Aarnisalo et al., 2002) of Nurr1
(Nurr1K555A/L556A/L557A, KLL) that prevented its ability to activate a Nurr1/RXR-dependent
(DR5)-promoter did not interfere with Nurr1-mediated repression of iNOS (Fig. 3B). On the
other hand, this I-box mutation increased transcriptional activation of Nurr1 monomers through
the NBRE element, as previously reported (Aarnisalo et al., 2002) (Fig. S6D).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

SUMOylation of NRs has recently been established to play important roles in transrepression
(Pascual et al., 2005). Since it is known that Nurr1 interacts with the protein inhibitor of
activated STAT (PIAS) 4 (Galleguillos et al., 2004), which is a SUMO E3 ligase, we examined
whether SUMOylation is also involved in Nurr1-mediated repression. As shown in Figure 3C,
knockdown of Ubc9, an essential E2 enzyme for SUMOylation (Hay, 2005), reversed Nurr1mediated repression of iNOS, suggesting that SUMOylation is required. Next, we confirmed
that Nurr1 could be SUMOylated with SUMO2 and SUMO3 using PIAS4 as an E3 ligase (Fig.
S6E and F) and found that IL1β stimulation could induce SUMOylation of Nurr1 in the absence
of overexpression of PIAS4 (Fig. S6F). Mutational studies demonstrated that lysine 558 and,
to a lesser extent lysine 576, are essential SUMO sites of Nurr1 (Fig. 3D). Since both K558R
and K576R mutants are located in the ligand binding domain and close to the I-box and RXR
is not required for repression activity (Fig. 3B and Fig. S6D), we hypothesize that
SUMOylation is required for monomerization of Nurr1. Consistent with this, K558R and
K576R mutants were less able to activate the NBRE reporter and preferentially activated the
DR5 reporter (Fig. S6G). In addition, reconstitution of BV2 microglia cells expressing the
Nurr1 shRNA-2 with a non-targeted (NT) form of WT Nurr1 reversed hyperactivation of the
endogenous iNOS and TNFα genes, while the non-targeted forms of the SUMOylation mutants
(Nurr1 K558R and K576R) did not (Fig. 3E, Fig S6H–I).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since transrepression requires the tethering of NRs to other transcription factors, we tested
whether Nurr1 could bind to transcription factors involved in inflammation, such as NF-κB.
Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays of Nurr1 in BV2 cells showed interaction with NFκB-p65 that was significantly enhanced by LPS treatment and independent of changes in Nurr1
protein levels (Fig. 3F and Fig. S6A). Phosphorylation of Serine-468 (S468) in p65 is associated
with negative regulation of NF-κB signaling (Buss et al., 2004) and can be mediated by
GSK3β, which is activated following TLR4 stimulation in human monocytes (Martin et al.,
2005). Furthermore, inactivation of GSK3β results in increased NF-κB-dependent transcription
of TNFα without changing the kinase activity of the IKK complex or the nuclear translocation
of p65 (Buss et al., 2004). Therefore, we hypothesized that S468 phosphorylation of p65 by
GSK3β might provide the docking site for tethering of Nurr1. Consistent with this possibility,
the GSK3β-specific inhibitor SB216763 (SB21) inhibited the interaction of Nurr1 and p65 in
BV2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3G and Fig. S7D) and prevented the recruitment
of Nurr1 to the TNFα-promoter, as determined by ChIP assay (Fig. 3A). To further confirm
GSK3β involvement, we performed TNFα-luciferase reporter assays in RAW264.7 cells
cotransfected with a kinase-dead mutant of GSK3β (GSK3β-K85R mutant, GSK3β-KD).
GSK3β-KD expression abolished the Nurr1-mediated transrepression of the TNFα-promoter
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. S7B). Furthermore, knockdown of GSK3β completely
prevented Nurr1-mediated iNOS repression (Fig. 3H). We further validated the contribution
of phospho-S468 in p65 by exchanging S468 for alanine (S468A). The p65 S468A mutant, but
not wild-type p65, reversed Nurr1-mediated iNOS repression in RAW264.7 cells in a doseCell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2009 October 3.

dependent manner (Fig. 3I and Fig. S7E). Finally, GSK3β stimulated the in vitro interaction
of Nurr1 with wild-type p65 but not with p65-S486A (Fig. S7C).

The CoREST-repressor complex is required for Nurr1-mediated transcriptional repression

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Transcriptional repression requires the recruitment of multiprotein complexes assembled on
central scaffolding proteins referred to as co-repressors. We used siRNAs against various
candidate corepressors in the iNOS-luciferase reporter assay and identified CoREST as being
essential for Nurr1-mediated repression (Fig. 4A and Fig. S8A). CoREST has been considered
to be dedicated to repression of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells or early precursors by
binding to neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF)/RE1-silencing transcription factor
(REST) (Ballas et al., 2005). CoREST assembles many chromatin-modifying enzymes,
including histone methyltransferase G9a, histone demethylase, lysine-specific demethylase
(LSD1) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and 2 (Shi et al., 2003). Using Nurr1-mediated
repression of iNOS-luciferase as an assay, we observed that G9a, LSD1 and HDAC1 were also
required for Nurr1-CoREST-mediated repression (Fig. S8B). Using co-IP, we also found that
LPS stimulated interaction of Nurr1 and CoREST in BV2 cells (Fig. 4B and Fig. S8C).
Although the CoREST complex consists of many proteins, the interaction between Nurr1 and
CoREST seemed to be direct, as indicated by in vitro GST-pull down assay (Fig. S8D). This
interaction was mediated by the DNA-binding domain of Nurr1 (Nurr1-DBD) (Fig. S8E).
When Nurr1-DBD was overexpressed in Hela cells, the interaction between Nurr1 and
CoREST was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. S8F). Furthermore, overexpression
of the Nurr1-DBD in RAW264.7 cells altered Nurr1-mediated repression of iNOS-promoter
activity (Fig. S8G).
Since Nurr1 can be phosphorylated by serine/threonine kinases (Nordzell et al., 2004), we
speculated that signal-dependent phosphorylation might contribute to the Nurr1-CoREST
interaction. Nemo-like kinase (NLK) received our attention because NLK is known to be
involved in the repression of various transcription factors (Yasuda et al., 2004). NLK
cooperates with TGFβ-activating kinase 1 (TAK1) and homeodomain-interacting kinase 2
(HIPK2) in Wnt signaling (Kanei-Ishii et al., 2004). Knockdown of NLK abolished Nurr1
repression of iNOS-promoter activity, whereas HIPK2 knockdown was much less effective
and TAK1 had no effect (Fig. 4C and Fig. S9A). Furthermore, overexpression of kinase-dead
NLK (NLKK155M, NLK-KD) in RAW264.7 cells inhibited Nurr1-mediated repression of
iNOS in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. S9B). Kinase assays showed that Nurr1, but not
CoREST, could be phosphorylated by active NLK in vitro (Fig. 4D). Finally, Nurr1-CoREST
interaction was significantly reduced by NLK-knockdown in BV2 cells (Fig. 4E).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To confirm whether CoREST was indeed localized to NF-κB target gene promoters in
association with p65 and Nurr1, we performed ChIP assays of the iNOS- and TNFα-promoters
in BV2 cells. The occupancy of NF-κB-p65, Nurr1 and CoREST on both the TNFα- and
iNOS-promoters by all three proteins was strongly increased upon LPS stimulation (Fig. 4F,
Fig. S9C). On the iNOS-promoter, which exhibits relatively slower activation kinetics, p65
binding preceded the binding of Nurr1, which in turn preceded recruitment of CoREST (Fig.
4F). To verify whether this system is indeed functional in vivo, we performed ChIP assays from
microdissected SN after the stereotaxic injection of LPS into the SN. Consistent with in vitro
data, Nurr1 is recruited to the iNOS- and TNFα–promoters after LPS stimulation (Fig. 4G, Fig.
S9D). Finally, we asked whether Nurr1 was indeed essential for the recruitment of the CoREST
complex to target gene promoters. ChIP experiments were performed using shNurr1- or shCtrlBV2 cells. In the absence of Nurr1, CoREST was not recruited to the TNFα-promoter (Fig.
4H, left panel). Interestingly, under these conditions, p65 was present at the TNFα-promoter
for extended times (Fig. 4H, right panel). Regulation of p65 acetylation by HDACs, including
HDAC1, is known to determine the duration of transcription (Ashburner et al., 2001). HDAC1

is recruited to TNFα or iNOS-promoter in an LPS-dependent manner; however, this recruitment
is severely impaired in the absence of Nurr1 (Fig. S9E). Finally, to verify an in vivo role for
the genes identified to be involved in Nurr1/CoREST transrepression pathway, BV2 cells were
transfected with siRNAs targeting their corresponding mRNAs and were tested for the ability
to increase the production of neurotoxic factors. As shown in Figure S10A, knockdown of each
of the molecules engaged in this Nurr1/CoREST-mediated transrepression pathway induced
significantly higher death of Neuro2A cells compared to control siRNA, as detected by TUNEL
ELISA assay
Nurr1 represses the production of neurotoxic factors in astrocytes

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The observation that astrocytes could amplify the neurotoxic effects initiated by microglia (Fig.
2J) suggested that pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by activated microglia such as TNFα
and IL1β could activate the astrocytes and induce the transcription of inflammatory neurotoxic
mediators (Fig. 2D–F and Fig. S6A–B). Consistent with this possibility, the receptors for
TNFα and IL1β are highly expressed in primary mouse and human astrocytes, but not microglia
(Fig. 5A–B, Fig. S11A–B). Nurr1 protein was expressed in resting human and mouse astrocytes
(Fig. S1E and F) and Nurr1 mRNA was induced by IL1β or TNFα (Fig. 5C, D and Fig. S11C,D).
To test the possibility that Nurr1 also participates in a signal-dependent negative feedback
mechanism in astrocytes, primary mouse and human astrocytes were infected with shCtrl- and
shNurr1-lentivirues. Activated astrocytes can up-regulate many pro- inflammatory genes,
including the iNOS and Ncf1 genes upon IL1β and TNFα stimulation, which are essential
enzymes for NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, respectively. Knockdown of
Nurr1 in astrocytes drastically increased mRNA expression of both iNOS and Ncf1 in response
to IL1β and TNFα and up-regulated NO production (Fig. 5E–G and S11E-F). Furthermore,
activated astrocytes can produce macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF1), which supports
the proliferation of microglia (Thery et al., 1992), and knockdown of Nurr1 significantly upregulated the transcription of CSF1 gene upon both TNFα and IL1β stimulation (Fig. 5H and
S11G). In contrast, transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a known
neurotrophin for dopaminergic neurons, was not affected by knockdown of Nurr1 (Fig. 5I and
S11H). These data indicate that Nurr1 also acts as a transcriptional repressor for inflammatory
neurotoxic mediators in astrocytes.
The Nurr1/CoREST transrepression pathway functions in astrocytes

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Finally, we asked whether the mechanism of transcriptional repression by Nurr1 in astrocytes
is similar to that in microglia. Treatment of primary mouse astrocytes with IL1β induced the
interaction of Nurr1 with p65 (Fig. 6A) and induced recruitment of both Nurr1 and p65 to the
iNOS-promoter (Fig. 6B). Recruitment of Nurr1 to the iNOS promoter was blocked by
inhibition of GSK3β by SB21 (Fig. 6C), consistent with TLR4 and IL1β receptors sharing the
MyD88 signaling pathway (Verstrepen et al., 2008). Nurr1 also interacted with CoREST in
astrocytes in a manner that was stimulated by IL1β (Fig. 6D), and both molecules were recruited
to the iNOS-promoter, as was observed in microglia (Fig. 6E). Knockdown of the components
of CoREST repressor complex such as LSD1, G9a and HDAC1 also up-regulated iNOS,
CSF1 and Ncf1 genes, suggesting that the CoREST-complex is required for Nurr1-mediated
transcriptional repression in astrocytes (Fig. 6F–H). Finally, knockdown of Nurr1 in astrocytes
resulted in prolonged occupancy of p65 on the iNOS promoter (Fig. 6I), similar to results
obtained in microglia (Fig. 4H).

DISCUSSION
Nurr1 exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in glia

cases are sporadic and of unknown etiology (Farrer, 2006; Moore et al., 2005). An improved

understanding of the causes of the more common forms of the disease will therefore be essential
in developing broadly applicable treatment strategies. Here, we demonstrate that in addition
to its essential roles in the development and maintenance of dopaminergic neurons, Nurr1 plays
a previously unexpected role in protecting these neurons from inflammation-induced
neurotoxicity. Several lines of evidence suggest that this role is due to its function as an inhibitor
of inflammatory gene expression in microglia and astrocytes (Fig. 7A). First, these studies
utilized a model system in which neurotoxicity was induced by LPS, which is not effectively
sensed by neurons and does not directly cause neuronal death. Second, reduction of Nurr1
expression in the SN (primarily in microglia and astrocytes) did not in itself lead to reduction
of TH+ neurons but did result in enhanced expression of inflammatory mediators and
accelerated loss of TH+ neurons in response to LPS. Finally, reduction of Nurr1 expression in
isolated microglia and astrocytes resulted in their exaggerated production of neurotoxic factors
in response to inflammatory stimuli.

Experiments employing sequential transfer of cell culture media from microglia to astrocytes
or vice versa indicate that astrocytes can act as amplifiers of microglia-derived mediators in
the production of neurotoxic factors. Collectively, our data are consistent with a model in which
LPS-induced expression of factors such as IL1β and TNFα by microglia results in paracrine
activation of astrocytes. This activation in turn is predicted to enhance production of toxic
mediators by astrocytes that include NO and ROS. These factors are suggested to act additively
or synergistically with neurotoxic factors produced by microglia (Fig. 7A). Experiments using
mixed neuronal cultures are of particular interest in this regard because they suggest that
activated microglia and astrocytes produce factors that exhibit relative specificity for TH+
neurons (Fig. 2H and I). Conversely, distinct neuronal cell types might exhibit different
sensitivities to neurotoxic factors based on protective systems, such as those conferred by genes
under the control of the PGC1α coactivitor (St-Pierre et al., 2006). Defining the specific
identities of the pathologically important factors produced by microglia and astrocytes and
their relative ability to exert toxic effects on different types of neurons will be important future
goals.

There is currently no evidence that LPS or bacterial infection contribute directly to the
pathogenesis of PD in humans. However, the emerging recognition of the roles of TLRs in a
number of inflammatory diseases raises the possibility that endogenous TLR ligands are
generated during aging that contribute to disease initiation or progression. For example,
components of dying cells, such as Hsp60, have been shown to trigger TLR4 activity (Lehnardt
et al., 2008). Other factors, such as ATP, can also induce inflammatory responses through other
signaling pathways (Di Virgilio, 2007). A transient event leading to neuronal injury could thus
lead to activation of microglia, with subsequent amplification of inflammation by astrocytes.
The present findings suggest that Nurr1 protects the CNS from amplification of inflammatory
signaling by microglia-astrocyte communication. Strategies to suppress expression of
neurotoxins either directly or by interfering with microglia/astrocyte communication may thus
have therapeutic utility. Furthermore, it may be necessary to suppress the production of
neurotoxic mediators by microglia and astrocytes in order to obtain reconstitution of functional
neuronal circuits using cell-based therapies (Brundin et al., 2008).
A Nurr1/CoREST transrepression pathway mediates feedback regulation of inflammatory
responses
Members of the NR4A family have been reported to both positively and negatively regulate
pro-inflammatory genes (Bonta et al., 2006; Doi et al., 2008; Pei et al., 2006). The present
studies demonstrate a potent anti-inflammatory activity of Nurr1 in microglia and astrocytes.
We propose that this anti-inflammatory activity is mediated by a Nurr1/CoREST
transrepression pathway that operates in a feedback manner to restore transcription of NF-κB

target genes to a basal state (Fig. 7B). In this pathway, Nurr1 is recruited to NF-κB on
inflammatory gene promoters dependent on GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of S468 of p65.
Nurr1 subsequently recruits the CoREST co-repressor complex in an NLK-dependent manner.
Since HDAC1-mediated deacetylation is known to regulate the duration of p65 transcriptional
activity, and HDAC1 is a component of the CoREST complex, the Nurr1-CoREST axis might
have essential roles in terminating inflammatory responses by p65 clearance from the target
promoters. These studies thus establish an unexpected biological role for the CoREST complex,
previously considered to mainly be involved in the repression of neuronal genes in NSCs or
non-neuronal cells (Ballas et al., 2005). We also find that overexpression of Nurr77 and Nor1
in a macrophage cell line can suppress iNOS activation in response to LPS (K.S., unpublished),
suggesting that the CoREST transrepression pathway may be widely used by members of the
NR4A family. Of interest, reduction of most of the well-established components of the CoREST complex severely compromises the anti-inflammatory activity of Nurr1. Quantitative
defects in the expression or activities of these proteins could thus predispose certain organ
systems to inflammation-sensitive pathologies, such as PD.

Experimental Procedures
Mice and isolation of primary cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River or Harlan and housed according to UCSD
or Salk Institute protocols, respectively. Mouse primary microglia cells and astrocytes from
the cerebrum of P0 pups. After 10–14 days of culture, microglia cells were isolated from
astrocytes by the magnetic sorting using anti-mouse CD11b beads (Miltenyi). Purity of each
population was over 98%, as determined by FACS. Murine microglial BV2 cells (kindly
provided by Katerina Akassoglou) and macrophage RAW264.7 cells were maintained with
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (low endotoxin, Hyclone) and penicillin/streptomycin.
For other cells, details appear in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Reagents
All smart-pool siRNAs and GIPZ lentivirus shRNAmir were purchased from Dharmacon and
Open Biosystems, respectively. LPS E. coli 0111:B4 used at 0.1 μg/ml final, SB216763 as
indicated, and Cycloheximide used at 10 μg/ml final were obtained from Sigma. Human and
mouse IL1β used at10 ng/ml final and TNFα used at 50 ng/ml final were from R&D system.
Stereotaxic Injection of lentivirus and LPS

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

LPS and/or lentiviruses were delivered to the right SN by stereotaxic injection at AP−3.3 mm,

performed as described before (Pascual et al., 2005). For endogenous co-IP experiments, antiNurr1 (E-20, Santa Cruz), anti-CoREST (E-15, Santa Cruz and Millipore) and anti-p65 (C-20,
Santa Cruz) were used for IP and Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation of tagged proteins,
M2 anti-Flag-agarose (Sigma) beads were used. NLK (Millipore) in vitro kinase reaction
(Kanei-Ishii et al., 2004) was performed using GST-fusion substrates.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For each experimental condition, 2 × 107 BV2 cells or 6 × 106 mouse primary astrocytes were
used. Cells were stimulated with LPS for BV2 cells and IL1β for astrocytes for the indicated
time before crosslinking for 10 minutes with 1% formaldehyde. Anti-Nurr1 (E- 20, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) anti-p65 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-CoREST (Millipore) or
control rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for IP. See details in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
