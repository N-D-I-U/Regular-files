GLUCOCORTICOID ATTENUATES BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC
FACTOR-DEPENDENT UPREGULATION OF GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS
VIA THE SUPPRESSION OF MICRORNA-132 EXPRESSION
MicroRNAs (miRs) are endogenous ⬃22 nt RNAs that
regulate various gene expression profiles via targeting
mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression (Bartel,
2004). A growing number of reports suggest that miRs are
important for various cellular processes, including differentiation, apoptosis, and metabolism in both animals and
plants (Schratt et al., 2006; Chapman and Carrington,
2007; Pillai et al., 2007). Recently, the neuronal roles of
miRs have been proposed. MiR-132 is increased by (brainderived neurotrophic factor) BDNF and is involved in the
promotion of neuronal outgrowth (Vo et al., 2005). Conversely, miR-134 negatively regulates the size of postsynaptic sites through inhibiting the translation of an mRNA
encoding a protein kinase, Limk1 (Schratt et al., 2006).
BDNF, a neurotrophin, is essential for a variety of
neuronal aspects, including proliferation, differentiation,
and survival in the CNS. In addition, BDNF promotes synaptic maturation and modulates synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP) (Bibel and Barde, 2000).
Importantly, BDNF may be a key molecule related to the
pathophysiology of mental disorders. For example, expression of BDNF is low in the brains of suicide victims with
depressive disorder (Karege et al., 2005). Reduction in the
level of BDNF was also observed in chronically stressed
rats (Smith et al., 1995; Hansson et al., 2003). Interestingly, a failure in the control of glucocorticoid (a stress
hormone) homeostasis is thought to be involved in the
symptoms of depressive disorder (Holsboer, 2000; Kunugi
et al., 2006). We have recently reported that glucocorticoid
suppressed the BDNF-induced synaptic maturation and
excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate release (Kumamaru
et al., 2008; Numakawa et al., 2009), while antidepressants reinforced the BDNF-triggered glutamate release
(Yagasaki et al., 2006). Collectively, these results suggest
that the prevention of BDNF action by increased glucocorticoid is closely related to depressive disorders.
It has been suggested that miR-132 is involved in
BDNF function; however, the mechanism underlying the
induction of miR-132 and the change in its function after
exposure to glucocorticoid has not been fully elucidated.
Here, we investigated the effect of BDNF on expression of
miR-132 and its function with or without glucocorticoid
pretreatment.

Abstract—Brain-specific microRNAs (miRs) may be involved
in synaptic plasticity through the control of target mRNA
translation. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) also
contributes to the regulation of synaptic function. However,
the possible involvement of miRs in BDNF-regulated synaptic
function is poorly understood. Importantly, an increase in
glucocorticoid levels and the downregulation of BDNF are
supposed to be involved in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. Previously, we reported that glucocorticoid
exposure inhibited BDNF-regulated synaptic function via
weakening mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase1/2 (MAPK/ERK) and/or phospholipase C-␥ (PLC-␥) intracellular signaling in cultured neurons
[Kumamaru et al (2008) Mol Endocrinol 22:546 –558; Numakawa et al (2009) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 106:647– 652].
Therefore, in this study, we investigate the possible influence
of glucocorticoid on BDNF/miRs-stimulated biological responses in cultured cortical neurons. Significant upregulation of miR-132 was caused by BDNF, although miR-9, -124,
-128a, -128b, -134, -138, and -16 were intact. Transfection of
exogenous ds-miR-132 induced marked upregulation of glutamate receptors (NR2A, NR2B, and GluR1), suggesting that
miR-132 has a positive effect on the increase in postsynaptic
proteins levels. Consistently, transfection of antisense RNA
to inhibit miR-132 function decreased the BDNF-dependent
increase in the expression of postsynaptic proteins. U0126,
an inhibitor of the MAPK/ERK pathway, suppressed the
BDNF-increased miR-132, suggesting that BDNF upregulates
miR-132 via the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway. Interestingly, pretreatment with glucocorticoid (dexamethasone, DEX) reduced BDNF-increased ERK1/2 activation, miR-132 expression, and postsynaptic proteins. We demonstrate that the
exposure of neurons to an excess glucocorticoid results in a
decrease in the BDNF-dependent neuronal function via suppressing miR-132 expression. © 2010 IBRO. Published by

solved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). DMSO alone had no effect compared
with no treatment (data not shown). U0126 (an inhibitor for MEK,
an upstream molecule of MAPK/ERK1/2) was purchased from
Promega (WI, USA), and used at a final concentration of 10 ␮M.
PD98059 (an inhibitor for MEK, Calbiochem-Novabiochem
GmbH, CA, USA) was used at 50 ␮M. LY294002 (a PI3 kinase
inhibitor, Calbiochem-Novabiochem GmbH) and U73122 (a phospholipase C-␥ (PLC-␥) inhibitor, Wako) were applied at 1.0 ␮M,
respectively. D-(⫺)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV),
and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) were purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). Other reagents were
obtained from Sigma (MO, USA). Regeneron Pharmaceutical Co.,
(NY, USA), Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and
Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) donated
the BDNF.

Cell cultures
Primary cultures were prepared from postnatal 2 day-old rat (SLC,
Shizuoka, Japan) cerebral cortex, as reported previously (Numakawa et al., 2002a,b). Dissociated cortical cells were plated at
a final density of 5⫻105/cm2 on polyethyleneimine-coated culture
dishes (Corning, NY, USA). The culture medium (5/5 DF) consisted of 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% heated-inactivated horse
serum, 90% of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Medium and Ham’s F-12 medium containing 15 mM HEPES
buffer, pH 7.4, 30 nM Na2SeO3 and 1.9 mg/ml NaHCO3. All
animals were treated according to the institutional guidelines for
the care and use of animals. All efforts were made to minimize
animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.

Drug application
Cortical cultures were maintained for 7 days (7 days in vitro, DIV7)
before DEX (final 1.0 ␮M) application. Seventy two hours later (at
DIV10), BDNF was applied, and an additional 24 h of maintenance
was carried out before sample collection for Northern blotting,
RT-PCR, and immunoblotting. U0126, PD98059, LY294002, or
U73122 was applied 20 min before BDNF addition.

Transfection of miR-132 antisense or ds-miR-132
To examine the function of endogenous miR-132, 2=-o-met-miR132 antisense oligonucleotide (5=-CGACCAUGGCUGUAGACUGUUA-3=, Hokkaido system science, Hokkaido, Japan) transfection was carried out at DIV9 for 24 h prior to BDNF addition at
DIV10. As a control, 2=-o-met-negative control oligonucleotide
(5=-AGACUAGCGGUAUCUUAAACC-3=) (Tsuchiya et al., 2006)
was used. Ds-miR-132 (double-stranded synthesized mature microRNA “miCENTURY OX miNatural,” B-Bridge, Tokyo, Japan,
sense strand 5=-CAACCGUGGCUUUCGAUUGUUACU-3=, antisense strand 5=-UAACAGUCUACAGCCAUGGUCGCC-3=), or
negative control siRNA (5=-ATCCGCGCGATAGTACGTA-3=, BBridge) was also transferred. The ds-miR-132 transfection was
conducted at DIV9. Forty eight hours later, the cortical cultures
were harvested for immunoblotting. When an influence of U0126
was examined, U0126 (10 ␮M) was applied just after the ds-miR132 transfection. RNA transfection (final 100 ng/ml, respectively)
was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, CA,
USA). After estimating the efficiency of transfection using Lipofectamine in our cortical neurons (with GFP plasmid, pAcGFP1N1, Clontech, CA, USA), we confirmed at least 39.1⫾4.6% (n⫽9)
of cells were transfected.

Northern blotting
Small RNAs (⬍200 nt) were isolated using a mirVanaTM miRNA
Isolation Kit (Ambion, TX, USA). The RNAs were separated on

15% acrylamide TBE-urea mini-gel and then electroblotted onto a
Hybond N⫹ nylon filter membrane (Amersham, Buckinghamshire,
UK). Antisense oligonucleotides for miR-9 (5=-TCATACAGCTAGATAACCAAAGA-3=), miR-124a (5=-TGGCATTCACCGCGTGCCTTAA-3=), miR-128a (5=-AAAAGAGACCGGTTCACTGTGA-3=),
miR-128b (5=-GAAAGAGACCGGTTCACTGTGA-3=), miR-132
(5=-CGACCATGGCTGTAGACTGTTA-3=), miR-134 (5=-CCCTCTGGTCAACCAGTCACA-3=), miR-138 (5=-GATTCACAACACCAGCT-3=), and miR-16 (5=-CGCCAATATTTACGTGCTGCTA3=) were labeled with [␥-32P] ATP using T4polynucleotide kinase
and hybridized to the filter in ULTRAhyb®-Ultrasensitive Hybridization Buffer (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To confirm equal loading, the blots were reprobed to detect
U6 snRNA. Quantitation was performed using a Bioimageanalyser
(BAS2500, Fuji film, Tokyo, Japan) system. In the present study,
we quantified the mature miR-132 (around 20 nt) because the
expression of pre-miR-132 (around 60 nt) could not be detected
(Supplemental figure).

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Total RNAs were isolated using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit
(Ambion). Quantitative analysis of miR-132 was carried out on
RNA samples using the specific stem-loop primers for reverse
transcription, followed by real-time TaqMan reagents (Applied
Biosystems, CA, USA). All values were normalized to achieve
endogenous control of miR-16. All amplicons were analyzed using
Prism 7900HT sequence detection system 2.2 software (Applied
Biosystems).

Immunoblotting
Cultured cells were lysed in a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) lysis
buffer containing 1% SDS, 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA
(pH 8.0), 10 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 0.5 mM phenylarsine oxide,
and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After boiling for 5 min,
lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 60 min, and the supernatants were collected. For equal loading, the protein concentration of the supernatants was determined with a BCA Protein Assay
Kit (Pierce, IL, USA). As primary antibodies, anti-NR2A (1:500,
Sigma, MO, USA), anti-NR2B (1:500, Sigma, MO, USA), antiGluR1 (1:1000, Chemicon, CA, USA), anti-synapsin I (1:2000,
Chemicon, CA, USA), anti-syntaxin (1:10,000; Sigma, MO, USA),
anti-SNAP25 (1:1000, Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany),
anti-TUJ1 (1:5000, Berkeley antibody company, CA, USA), antiphospho-ERK (1:1000, Cell Signaling, MA, USA), anti-ERK (1:
1000, Cell Signaling), anti-TrkB (1:1000, BD Biosciences, CA,
USA), and anti-phospho-Trk antibodies (Stephens et al., 1994,
1:1000, Cell Signaling, MA, USA) were used. The n indicates the
number of experiments performed with separate cultures. The
intensity of the immunoreactivity was quantified by using Lane and
Spot Analyzer software (ATTO Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).

Immunocytochemistry
The cortical neurons were fixed with methanol at ⫺20 °C for 10
min. The cells were permeabilized, and the non-specific binding of
antibodies was blocked with 10% goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100
in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. As the primary antibody,
anti-MAP 2 (1:1000, Sigma) was applied overnight at 4 °C. Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Invitrogen) was
used as a secondary antibody. For the Hoechst staining, nuclei of
cells were stained with 2 mg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) at 37 °C for 1 h before the number of
condensed and/or fragmentation nuclei were counted (Hetman et
al., 1999).

MTT assay
To measure the cell viability, the metabolic activity of mitochondria
was estimated by measuring the mitochondrial-dependent conversion of the tetrazolium salt, MTT (Sigma) as described previously
(Numakawa et al., 2007). Seventy two hours DEX incubation was
started at DIV7 before BDNF addition at DIV10. Twenty four hours
later, cultured neurons were incubated with MTT solution. Two
hours later, cultures were lysed and the metabolic activity of the
mitochondrial reductase was determined. To investigate the effect
of intracellular signaling inhibitors, 24 h U0126, LY293002, or
U73122 incubation was started at DIV10. Twenty four hours later,
neurons were incubated with MTT solution for estimating the cell
viability.

Statistical analysis
Data shown in this study are expressed as mean⫾standard
deviation (SD). Statistical significance was evaluated using Student’s t-test, or one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple
comparison test performed by GraphPad Prism ver.5 (GraphPad
Software Inc., CA, USA). The probability values less than 5%
were considered significant.

RESULTS
BDNF increased the expression of miR-132 in
cultured cortical neurons
We first investigated the changes of expression of various
miRs after BDNF application in cultured cortical neurons.
Mir-9, -124, -128a, -128b, -132, -134, and -138 are brainspecific miRs (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002); on the other
hand, miR-16 is known to be ubiquitously expressed
(Hayes et al., 2008). As shown in Fig. 1A, northern blot
analysis indicates that an increase in the expression of
miR-132 was induced by BDNF application for 24 h in
cortical neurons. In contrast, the levels of the other miRs,
including miR-9, -124, -128a, -128b, -134, -138, and -16
were unchanged. Quantitative analysis was performed
(Fig. 1B). Using the RT-PCR method, we checked the
upregulation of miR-132 after BDNF stimulation for various
durations. A significant increase of miR-132 was observed
after BDNF application for 6 –24 h, although acute BDNF
stimulation (10 min, or 1 h) failed to increase the miR-132
(Fig. 1C). In the following experiment, incubation with
BDNF was performed for 24 h. In our cultures, we examined the changes in the expression of miR-132 during
maturation in vitro (at DIV 3, DIV7, and DIV 10), however,
significant increase in the endogenous miR-132 during in
vitro maturation was not observed (DIV7, 116⫾2.2; DIV10,
111⫾3.6, % (per DIV3), n⫽3).
Many BDNF actions are dependent on the activation of
a specific receptor, TrkB, which is broadly expressed in the
brain. In contrast, the expression of TrkA, a receptor for
NGF (nerve growth factor), is restricted and limited neuronal populations (for instance, cholinergic neurons in the
basal forebrain) exhibit biological responses to NGF (Hatanaka et al., 1988; Fagan et al., 1997). BDNF increased
the expression of miR-132 in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 1D). Importantly, NGF had no effect on the miR-132
expression, suggesting that BDNF-stimulated miR-132 upregulation is via the activation of TrkB. In cortical neurons,
BDNF induces rapid and transient release of glutamate

(Numakawa et al., 2009), implying that activation of glutamate receptors may be involved in the miR-132 upregulation. Therefore, we confirmed that BDNF still increased
miR-132 in the presence of APV (an N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor inhibitor) and CNQX (an AMPA receptor

inhibitor), indicating that BDNF has a direct effect on miR132 upregulation, not via activation of glutamate receptors
(Fig. 1E).
DEX pretreatment suppressed BDNF-increased
miR-132 expression
Next, we investigated whether chronic DEX (a synthetic
GR-selective agonist) exposure influences BDNF-increased
miR-132 in cultured cortical neurons. We monitored the
effect of various durations of DEX pretreatment on BDNFincreased miR-132 using the RT-PCR method. As shown
in Fig. 2A, the upregulation of miR-132 by BDNF was
decreased by the DEX pretreatment for 48 or 72 h. We

found a trend for decreasing levels of miR-132 after 24 h
DEX pretreatment, although a significant decrease was not
detected. By using northern blot analysis, we confirmed
the suppression of the BDNF-increased miR-132 after 72 h
exposure to DEX (a, b in Fig. 2B). U6 is displayed as a
control.
To check the influence of DEX exposure on neuronal
survival, immunocytochemistry with anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2, a neuronal cell marker) antibody
was performed, and no change in the number of MAP2positive cells was observed (a in Fig. 2C). Consistently,
none of the treatments increased apoptosis, as measured
by Hoechst staining [BDNF, 99⫾12; DEX, 99⫾9.7; DEX⫹

results suggest that the inhibitory effect of DEX on the
BDNF-increased miR-132 is not due to a decline in the cell
viability.
MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway was important for
BDNF-increased miR-132
BDNF exerts its biological effects through activating intracellular signaling, including MAPK/ERK1/2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and PLC-␥ pathways, after the
activation of TrkB. To identify essential signaling for the
BDNF-dependent miR-132 increase, the effect of each

pathway inhibitor was examined. We found that the BDNFdependent miR-132 increase was reduced by the ERK1/2
pathway inhibitor, U0126, by northern blot analysis (Fig.
3A). The dose-dependency of U0126 on the decrease in
the miR-132 expression was confirmed (Fig. 3B). PD98059,
a distinct inhibitor of the ERK1/2 pathway, also decreased
the BDNF-dependent miR-132 increase (Fig. 3C). The
contribution of the other pathways activated by TrkB, i.e.,
the PI3K and PLC-␥ pathways, were also examined. As
illustrated, BDNF still increased the miR-132 level in the
presence of LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor (Fig. 3D). U73122,
a PLC-␥ pathway inhibitor, did not inhibit BDNF-increased
miR-132 expression (Fig. 3E). As shown in Fig. 3F, the
viability of the cultured cells after a 24 h incubation with the
U0126, U73122, or LY294002 was not changed. These
results suggest that activation of the ERK1/2 is necessary,

1306

and functions as the upstream regulator of the BDNFpotentiated miR-132 expression.
The miR-132 was involved in the BDNF-dependent
increase in expression of postsynaptic proteins
Previously, we reported that BDNF increases synaptic proteins via the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway (Matsumoto et al.,
2006; Kumamaru et al., 2008). Therefore, to verify the
possible involvement of miR-132 in the regulation of preand postsynaptic protein expression, the effect of an antisense oligonucleotide to inhibit the miR-132 function was
examined. Consistent with our previous studies, BDNF
significantly increased postsynaptic proteins (ionotropic
glutamate receptors) NR2A, NR2B, and GluR1. Interestingly, these increases were weakened by the antisense
transfection (Fig. 4A). As shown, miR-132 antisense partly
reduced the BDNF-induced upregulation of glutamate receptor subunits. There may be an alternative mechanism
(including regulation by other unknown miRs) that also
controls the BDNF-increased glutamate receptors. The
level of TUJ1 (class III ␤-tubulin, a neuronal marker) is
shown as a control (Fig. 4A). Levels of presynaptic proteins, including synapsin I, SNAP25, and syntaxin were
also checked. In contrast to postsynaptic proteins, no
change in the levels of these presynaptic proteins was
caused by miR-132 antisense with or without BDNF (Fig.

Fig. 4. Antisense RNA transfection to obstruct the function of endogenous miR-132 inhibited the BDNF-increased postsynaptic proteins,
and the transfection of ds-miR-132 mimicked the BDNF action. (A)
BDNF-increased NR2A, NR2B, and GluR1 were decreased by the
miR-132 antisense transfection. TUJ1 (a neuronal marker) is shown as
a control. Samples for immunoblotting were collected after BDNF

Quantification was performed by densitometry after Western blotting. Antisense and BDNF were applied as indicated in the legend for
Fig. 4. To quantify Western blot, normalization using response to sole
BDNF application was performed. Increase in NR2A and GluR1 expressions by BDNF was significantly attenuated by the antisense for
miR-132. The decreasing tendency in the NR2B levels by the antisense was also observed although the statistical significance was not
confirmed. In contrast, the levels of presynaptic proteins, including
synapsin I and SNAP25 were not changed. Data represent the

4B). Quantification of these pre- and postsynaptic proteins
was performed (Table 1). Furthermore, the effect of exogenous ds-miR-132 (double-stranded synthesized precursor of mature microRNA) transfection was examined. As
shown in Fig. 4C, marked upregulation of NR2A, NR2B,
and GluR1 was induced by the transfection of ds-miR-132.
These results suggest that miR-132 is involved in the
BDNF-mediated upregulation of postsynaptic proteins.
Previously, we showed that DEX inhibits BDNF-increased synaptic proteins via inhibiting ERK1/2 activation
in immature hippocampal neurons (Kumamaru et al.,
2008). Thus, in the present system, we examined whether
there was a decline in the BDNF-stimulated ERK1/2 activation after DEX pretreatment. As expected, DEX suppressed the BDNF-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2
(activated ERK1/2 form, pERK1/2) in cultured cortical neurons (a in Fig. 5A). Total ERK1/2 expression was not
affected (a in Fig. 5A). Quantification of pERK1/2 levels
was carried out (b in Fig. 5A).
As shown in Fig. 3, it is possible that miR-132 expression was regulated via the ERK1/2 pathway. Thus, to
further clarify whether ERK1/2 activation is upstream of the
BDNF-potentiated miR-132 expression, the effect of miR132 antisense transfection on the ERK1/2 activation was
examined. Surprisingly, ERK1/2 activation by BDNF was
diminished by the miR-132 antisense (a, b in Fig. 5B),
implying that miR-132 also affects ERK1/2 activation. We
examined an effect of miR-132 antisense transfection on
the level of TrkB protein because the TrkB receptor is
upstream of ERK1/2 activation. As shown, TrkB expression was not influenced by the antisense transfection (a in
Fig. 5C). Furthermore, we examined whether BDNF-induced Trk activation is altered by miR-132 antisense.
Western blotting using phospho-Trk antibody (Stephens et
al., 1994) revealed that an inhibitory effect of miR-132
antisense on Trk activation was not induced (b in Fig. 5C).
Lastly, the effect of U0126, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2

partly but significantly decreased the upregulation of these
glutamate receptors, implying that unknown regulation, including involvement of other unknown miRs downstream
of ERK1/2 activation, may also contribute to the BDNFstimulated increase in glutamate receptors (Fig. 6).

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we found that BDNF induced the
upregulation of miR-132 through the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway in cultured cortical neurons. Transfection of antisense
RNA to inhibit the miR-132 function diminished the BDNF-

1307

dependent increase in the expression of postsynaptic proteins. Transfection of ds-miR-132 upregulated these synaptic proteins in the absence of BDNF. Remarkably, pretreatment with DEX, a synthetic glucocorticoid, decreased
BDNF-increased ERK1/2 activation, miR-132 expression,
and postsynaptic protein levels.
MiR-132 is critical for BDNF-stimulated dendritic outgrowth (Vo et al., 2005). Morphological change in dendrites might be associated with synaptic connections.
Thus, a possible involvement of miR-132 in the maintenance of pre- and postsynaptic protein expressions is an
interesting issue. We previously reported that BDNF upregulates synaptic proteins in cultured hippocampal and
cortical neurons (Matsumoto et al., 2006; Kumamaru et al.,
2008). Thus, in the present study, a possible role of miR132 in the BDNF-regulated expression of synaptic proteins
was examined. BDNF dramatically increased various synaptic proteins, including NR2A, NR2B, GluR1, and synapsin I in cultured cortical neurons. Importantly, the inhibitory
effect of miR-132 antisense on the BDNF-increased
postsynaptic proteins (especially, NR2A and GluR1) was
considerable. On the other hand, presynaptic synapsin I
was not influenced by the miR-132 antisense. These results suggest that miR-132 plays a role in postsynaptic
protein expression regulated by BDNF, although roles of
miR-132 in presynaptic regulation may be further elucidated if neuronal maturity or cell type is altered.
In the present study, upregulation of post-synaptic proteins following the ds-miR-132 transfection occurred. Le et
al. reported that endogenous levels of miR-125b are relatively low, and that consequent transfection of the miR125b duplex brings miR-125b levels up by ⬃27 fold (Le et
al., 2009). In their study, ectopic expression of miR-125b
downregulates the target protein p53 by ⬃40%. Notably,
the suppression of p53 achieved by the miR-125b duplex
was not stronger compared to the p53 siRNA, implying that
a higher concentration of ectopic miR is required. In our
case, though endogenous miR-132 was also relatively low,
the miR-132 level was significantly upregulated by BDNF
application. In our preliminary experiment (using a SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cell line), transfection of ds-miR-132
caused the upregulation of miR-132 expression by ⬃210
fold. As a result, the strong expression of miR-132 may
influence the expression of post-synaptic proteins via suppression of target gene expression. Recently, Wayman
reported that the miR132-p250GAP pathway plays a key
role in activity-dependent dendrite growth in cultured hippocampal neurons (Wayman et al., 2008). In their system,
bicuculline-mediated inhibition of GABAA inhibitory tone (to
increase spontaneous synaptic activity) and transfection of
miR-132 increased total dendritic length. Interestingly, in
their data, inhibition of miR-132 by 2=-O-methyl RNA antagonists blocked the bicuculline and exogenous miR-132
actions. However, marked decrease of dendritic length
was not achieved by solo 2=-O-methyl RNA antagonist
application compared with control. In our present study,
the significant downregulation of post-synaptic proteins
was not induced by the miR-132 antagonist alone. It is
possible that the amount of the miR132 above threshold

may be required for enhanced action of miR-132 in dendritic outgrowth and upregulation of post-synaptic proteins.
Moreover, there is a possibility that the miR-132 is important for enhancement of expression of these proteins, but
not for basal level maintenance of these proteins.
Chronic stress and glucocorticoid administration causes
dendritic atrophy in hippocampal neurons (Woolley et al.,
1990; Watanabe et al., 1992; Magariños et al., 1996; Liu et
al., 2006). The MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway is important for
dendritic formation (Miller and Kaplan, 2003) and we had
also confirmed the importance of the activation of ERK1/2
in the neurite outgrowth in developing cortical neurons
(Numakawa et al., 2004). Furthermore, we recently found
that DEX exhibits an inhibitory effect on BDNF-increased
synaptic proteins through preventing ERK1/2 activation in
immature hippocampal neurons (Kumamaru et al., 2008).
In the present study, we found that BDNF-increased miR132 was decreased by DEX in mature cortical neurons,
and that the BDNF-dependent increase in the miR-132
level was repressed by MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors
(U0126 and PD98059). In addition to the MAPK/ERK1/2
pathway, the TrkB receptor activates the PI3K pathways,
which is critical for cell survival (Patapoutian and Reichardt,
2001; Rodgers and Theibert, 2002; Zheng and Quirion,
2004). In our system, LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) had no
effect on BDNF-stimulated miR-132 increase. Consistently, neuronal survival was not changed after DEX exposure. Inhibition of the PLC-␥ pathway, another downstream
signaling of TrkB, had no effect on the miR-132 increase.
Therefore, the DEX-dependent prevention of the increase
in postsynaptic proteins may be due to diminishing MAPK/
ERK1/2 signaling, especially. In our recent study, neurotransmitter release and the activation of PLC-␥ stimulated
by acute BDNF application after long-term glucocorticoid
exposure (24 – 48 h) were decreased in developing cortical
neurons (Numakawa et al., 2009). Collectively, it is possible that glucocorticoids play a variety of functions depending on exposure time to glucocorticoids, neuronal cell
types, or their maturity.
The MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway is an important intracellular signaling for the upregulation of miR-132 during BDNF
stimulation. With regard to a blocking experiment, the
BDNF-dependent miR-132 increase was prevented by
U0126 in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that

ERK1/2 activation is upstream of miR-132 upregulation.
Unexpectedly, the decrease in the ERK1/2 activation was
observed after transfection of the miR-132 antisense, implying that miR-132 has a positive influence on the ERK1/2
activation. Actually, following the miRNA specific target
detection algorithm (TargetScan, available at: http://www.
targetscan.org/) was used to identify the predicted mRNA
targets, we found two putative binding sites of miR-132
within 3= UTR of ERK1 mRNA (unpublished data). As the
first binding site was conserved among vertebrates, we
focused on the first binding site for reporter analysis and
found that miR-132 decreased reporter activity (unpublished data). However, as shown above, total protein level
of ERK1/2 was not affected by DEX and miR-132 antisense in our cultured neurons. In general, it is reasonable
that miR-132 antisense blocks the endogenous miR-132
action and increases the levels of both pERK1 and total
ERK1, if ERK1 is a target for miR-132. Furthermore, we
confirmed that the level of TrkB after miR-132 antisense
application was not altered. In addition, BDNF-stimulated
Trk activation was not altered by miR-132 antisense. Thus,
other molecules including phosphatase targeted by miR132, that prevents the activation of ERK1/2 or up-stream
molecules of ERK1/2, might be a potential target of miR132 (Fig. 7). Taken together, it is possible that a positive
feedback system functions between ERK1/2 signaling and
miR-132 for BDNF-dependent upregulation in expression
of postsynaptic proteins.
Interestingly, miR-21 regulates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in cardiac fibroblasts (Thum et al., 2008). The
miR-21 is increased selectively in fibroblasts of the failing
heart, augmenting MAPK/ERK activity through inhibition of
sprouty homologue 1 (Spry1). Indeed, after the miRNA
specific target detection algorithm (TargetScan, available
at: http://www.targetscan.org/) was used, a putative binding site of miR-132 within 3= UTR of Spry1 mRNA was
found (data not shown). As Spry1 is a potent inhibitor of
the MAPK/ERK pathway (Hanafusa et al., 2002), it is
possible that Spry1 may be involved in miR-132-regulated MAPK/ERK signaling, although additional investigation is necessary.
In our cortical cultures, miR-132 expression could be
detected, although its level was very low compared with
that of miR-9, -124, -128a, or -128b. Interestingly, miR-132

Fig. 7. A positive feedback system functions between ERK1/2 signaling
and miR-132. In our system, the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway is important
for the upregulation of miR-132 during BDNF stimulation. Pretreatment
with DEX declined BDNF-increased ERK1/2 activation and miR-132
expression. The BDNF-dependent miR-132 increase was attenuated
by U0126 and PD98059 (both are ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors), suggesting that activation of ERK1/2 is upstream of miR-132 upregulation.
In contrast, miR-132 antisense transfection resulted in decrease in the
ERK1/2 activation, implying that miR-132 also has a positive influence
on the ERK1/2 pathway. In our cultures, total level of ERK1/2, and
expression and activation of Trk were not changed by DEX and
miR-132 antisense application. Therefore, unknown phosphatase, that
prevents the activations of ERK1/2 or up-stream molecules of ERK1/2,
might be targets of miR-132. It is possible that a positive feedback
system functions between ERK1/2 signaling and miR-132.

expression was significantly upregulated after BDNF addition. In contrast, the levels of miR-9, -124, -128a and -128b
were not affected by BDNF. Thus, it is possible that the
function of miR-132 in the cortical system is strictly controlled by BDNF. Computer analysis predicted many candidate genes as targets of miR-132; however, we were
unable to identify a direct target involved in the upregulation of ERK1/2 activation or postsynaptic protein expression. In primary human preadipocytes and in vitro differentiated adipocytes, miR-132 plays a role in activation of
nuclear factor-kappaB (Strum et al., 2009). Very recently,
Tai et al. reported that serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible
kinase 1, SGK1, directly phosphorylates IKK␣ at Thr-23
and indirectly activates IKK␣ at Ser-180, and that the
SGK1 phosphorylation of IKK␣ results in the phosphorylation and activation of nuclear factor-kappaB that consequently upregulates NR2A and NR2B expression (Tai et
al., 2009). Klein et al. showed that methyl CpG– binding
protein 2 (MeCP2) translation is regulated by miR132
(Klein et al., 2007). Importantly, MeCP2 controls excitatory
synaptic strength by regulating the glutamatergic synapse
number in hippocampal neurons (Chao et al., 2007). In our
cortical cultures, BDNF significantly induced the increase
in miR-132 levels and it is possible that miR-132 is important for the BDNF-induced postsynaptic protein expression. The miR-132 is also increased in an activity-dependent manner (Wayman et al., 2008). They showed that

1309

neuronal activity inhibited translation of p250GAP (Rho
family GTPase-activating protein), a miR-132 target, and
siRNA-mediated knockdown of p250GAP mimicked miR132-induced dendrite growth in hippocampal neurons
(Wayman et al., 2008). Taken together, it may be valuable
to study whether these miR-132-regulated molecules including nuclear factor-kappaB, MeCP2, and p250GAP are involved in the BDNF-induced postsynaptic protein expression.
Here, we found that DEX exposure negatively regulated BDNF/miR-132 system-mediated glutamate receptor
expression in cortical cultures. BDNF is produced and
secreted in an activity-dependent manner (Schinder and
Poo, 2000; Hartmann et al., 2001; Balkowiec and Katz,
2002). Thus, continuous weak synaptic activity due to the
downregulation of glutamate receptors, which is induced
by exposure with increased glucocorticoid, may result in
the reduction of BDNF protein levels, as observed in depressive disorder (Gervasoni et al., 2005; Karege et al.,
2005). Thus, our system, where the upregulation of synaptic proteins occurs through the BDNF/miR-132-dependent signaling, could be used as an in vitro model for
evaluating novel analogs as antidepressant candidates.
