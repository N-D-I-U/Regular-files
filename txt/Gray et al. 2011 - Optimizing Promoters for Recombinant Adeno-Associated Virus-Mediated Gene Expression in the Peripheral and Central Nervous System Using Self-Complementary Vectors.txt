Abstract

With the increased use of small self-complementary adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, the design of compact
promoters becomes critical for packaging and expressing larger transgenes under ubiquitous or cell-specific
control. In a comparative study of commonly used 800-bp cytomegalovirus (CMV) and chicken b-actin (CBA)
promoters, we report significant differences in the patterns of cell-specific gene expression in the central and
peripheral nervous systems. The CMV promoter provides high initial neural expression that diminishes over
time. The CBA promoter displayed mostly ubiquitous and high neural expression, but substantially lower
expression in motor neurons (MNs). We report the creation of a novel hybrid form of the CBA promoter (CBh)
that provides robust long-term expression in all cells observed with CMV or CBA, including MNs. To develop a
short neuronal promoter to package larger transgenes into AAV vectors, we also found that a 229-bp fragment of
the mouse methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MeCP2) promoter was able to drive neuron-specific expression
within the CNS. Thus the 800-bp CBh promoter provides strong, long-term, and ubiquitous CNS expression
whereas the MeCP2 promoter allows an extra 570-bp packaging capacity, with low and mostly neuronal expression within the CNS, similar to the MeCP2 transcription factor.

Introduction

A

deno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have been used
in research, preclinical, and clinical gene delivery studies
primarily because these vectors transduce nondividing cells
and confer long-term stable gene expression without associated inflammation or toxicity (Haberman et al., 1998; Bessis
et al., 2004; Goncalves, 2005). AAV has a single-stranded 4.7kb genome, and after removal of 4.4 kb of the viral genome
recombinant vectors can be packaged with a similar-sized
foreign piece of DNA. A more recent advance in AAV vector
technology has been the self-complementary (sc) vector, the
genome of which is composed of complementary copies of the
DNA insert linked in cis through a mutated AAV inverted

terminal repeat (ITR). scAAV vectors have 10- to 100-fold
higher transduction efficiency compared with traditional
single-stranded AAV (ssAAV) vectors (McCarty et al., 2001,
2003), facilitating more global applications, such as intravenous or intracerebrospinal fluid injection. However, a potential drawback of scAAV vectors for some genes is that the
packaging capacity is cut in half, to approximately 2.2 kb of
foreign DNA. Thus, a major challenge in effectively using
scAAV vectors has been to combine minimal promoter, intron, and polyadenylation [poly(A)] elements in order to
maximize the remaining space for the transgene-coding sequence (Wu et al., 2008). To simplify our descriptions and
discussion of the regulatory elements including the enhancer,
promoter, and 5¢ untranslated region (UTR), throughout this

text these combined elements will often be referred to simply
as the ‘‘promoter.’’
The cytomegalovirus (CMV) early enhancer/promoter
and the hybrid CMV enhancer/chicken b-actin (CBA)
promoter are commonly used in gene transfer studies with
both therapeutic and reporter genes. These promoters are
typically used to provide robust, long-term expression in all
cell types. The 800-bp CMV enhancer/promoter has often
been used to achieve rapid and ubiquitous expression, with
the caveat that it is prone to silencing over time in some
tissues, specifically the hippocampus, striatum, and substantia nigra in the brain (McCown et al., 1996; Klein et al.,
1998; Paterna et al., 2000; Tenenbaum et al., 2004). Although
promoters such as the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and
neuron-specific human platelet-derived growth factor-b
(PDGF-b) chain can provide strong and long-term expression, their larger sizes make them less preferable for scAAV
vectors. The 1.6-kb hybrid promoter composed of the CMV
immediate-early enhance, CBA promoter, and CBA intron
1/exon 1 (commonly called the CAGGS promoter; Niwa
et al., 1991) has been shown to provide ubiquitous and longterm expression in the brain (Klein et al., 2002). An 800-bp
miniature version of this CMV enhancer/CBA promoter
was made by replacing the CBA 5¢ (UTR) with a smaller
simian virus 40 (SV40) intron (Wang et al., 2003). The
smaller size of this promoter proved especially useful for
scAAV vectors. However, we report that this shortened
version of the CBA promoter does not support the same
level of motor neuron (MN) gene expression as seen with
the CMV promoter.
Given this difference, the following studies sought to determine whether the shortened CBA promoter contributed to
this differential tropism and how one might overcome this
limited cellular expression. We found that the mini-CBA
promoter was deficient for MN expression and that the CMV
promoter, although giving robust initial MN expression, was
silenced by 10 weeks in the spinal cord. Our studies resulted
in the development of a novel version of the CBA promoter,
called CBh, which provides long-term transgene expression
in all cell types seen with the CBA or CMV promoter, at
levels matching or exceeding each. In a separate effort to
develop a smaller neural promoter to aid in packaging larger
transgenes at lower regulated expression levels, we tested a
truncated 229-bp promoter fragment from the murine
methyl-CpG-binding protein-2 (MeCP2) gene that can drive
neuronal expression. As a result of these studies, two novel
promoters are now available to drive long-term neural expression: one with strong ubiquitous expression and one
with an advantageous smaller size and weak neuronal expression.

method in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells as
described (Grieger et al., 2006). All recombinant vectors packaged self-complementary genomes with enhanced GFP.
Highly pure recombinant virus containing self-complementary
genomes was recovered by passage through two sequential
CsCl gradients, and then the peak fractions were dialyzed in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% d-sorbitol.
Viral titers were determined by quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR) (Gray et al., 2010).
Analysis of promoters in cultured rat
hippocampal slices
Rat hippocampal slices were prepared as described by
Fuller and Dailey (2007). Briefly, postnatal day 5 (P5) SpragueDawley rat pups were killed and the hippocampi were manually dissected. Harvested tissue was sliced into 250-lm-thick
sections, using a McIlwain tissue chopper, and plated on
PICM0RG50 0.4-lm membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA)
with full complement medium. Slices were cultured for 7 days
before infection. Each viral vector was diluted to 1 · 107 vector
genomes (VG)/ll in PBS and individual slices were infected
with approximately 5 ll (5 · 107 VG) by direct application.
Slices were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37C and imaged daily.
Average fluorescence intensity from each slice was measured
with a stereomicroscope (Lumar; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany) with a 0.5 numerical aperture (NA) objective. The
observed fluorescence was normalized to a control test strip
(available upon request from Chroma Technology, Bellows
Falls, VT). In addition, each image was scaled on the basis of
exposure time, and detector linearity was measured each day.
High-resolution images were obtained by two-photon nondescan detection microscopy on a Zeiss Axio Examiner with
710 confocal scanning unit. All images were recorded with
either a · 20 Apochromat 1.0 NA or · 63 Plan-Apochromat 0.8
NA lens set for Nyquist sampling with a non-descan photomultiplier tube detector.
To evaluate GFP levels per cell (see Fig. 2), high-resolution
images of hippocampal neurons in organotypic configuration were examined. The images were collected as a threedimensional data set, and individual cells were manually
selected by outlining the area for a cell on each plane within
the z stack. The total intensity and thresholded area were
calculated at each plane and summated to provide the total
integrated intensity and summated area, respectively. Cell
size is directly related to the summated area for the individual cell across the entire z stack. The integrated intensity/
summated area is directly related to the GFP concentration.
For data presentation (see Fig. 2), cells were sorted into exponentially larger bins based on cell size. Here we set a
threshold that all bins must contain three individual cells to
be considered significant and included in Fig. 2.

All vectors used enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)
as the packaged gene. The sources of enhancer, promoter,
intron, and polyadenylation signal are provided in Table 1.

All investigations were approved by the University of
North Carolina (UNC)-Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (Chapel Hill, NC). All injections were
done in 8- to 12-week-old female BALB/c mice weighing
approximately 20 g, purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar
Harbor, ME). For intravenous delivery, 200 ll of scAAV9
vector (2 · 1011 total VG) was injected into the tail vein. Four
or 14 weeks after vector injection, each mouse was killed and

transcardially perfused with PBS containing heparin at 1 U/
ml (Abraxis Pharmaceutical Products, Schaumburg, IL).
For intrathecal delivery, 3.75 ll of scAAV9 vector
(1.25 · 109 total VG) was mixed with 1.25 ll of 60% lidocaine
(MPI Biomedicals, Solon, OH) in PBS, to make a vector solution containing 15% lidocaine in 1 · PBS plus 3.75% sorbitol. This 5-ll solution was then injected into the intrathecal
space of the lower lumbar cord of a nonsedated mouse, as
described in Hylden and Wilcox (1980). Needle penetration
into the intrathecal space was indicated by a tail flick, and
then successful injections were confirmed by transient (10–
15 min) bilateral paralysis of the hind limbs, from the lidocaine. Mice were killed 3 or 10 weeks later, and then transcardially perfused with PBS.
Tissue processing, immunohistochemistry,
and immunofluorescence
For all immunohistochemistry, samples were processed as
follows. After 48 hr of fixation in freshly made PBS with 4%
paraformaldehyde, the entire brain and lumbar spinal cord
were sectioned at 40 lm, using a vibratome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) at room temperature. To enhance the signal observed with GFP, every fifth section was
processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC). Samples were
incubated for 1 hr with shaking at room temperature in
blocking solution (10% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 ·
PBS), and then incubated for 48–72 hr at 4C in primary
antibody solution (3% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 ·
PBS, rabbit anti-GFP [AB3080, diluted 1:500; Millipore]).
After washing three times in 1 · PBS, secondary amplification was performed with a VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit
(#PK-6101; Vector Laboratories) with 3,3¢-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride (DAB) (04008; Polysciences, Warrington,
PA) substrate and nickel–cobalt intensification of the reaction
product.
For the MeCP2 promoter (MeP)–GFP colocalization
studies, blocking and primary antibody incubations were
done as described previously, except that donkey serum was
used for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) labeling. After
washing, the sections were incubated with shaking for 1 hr at
room temperature in secondary antibody solution (3% goat

or donkey serum, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 · PBS, secondary
antibodies), and then washed three more times in 1 · PBS.
Primary antibodies were as follows: rabbit anti-GFP (AB3080,
diluted 1:500; Millipore) with either mouse anti-neuronspecific nuclear protein (NeuN) (MAB377, diluted 1:500;
Millipore) or goat anti-ChAT (AB144P, diluted 1:100; Millipore). Secondary antibodies were as appropriate, each at
1:1000 dilution: goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (A11008; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat antimouse (A11032; Invitrogen), and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated
donkey anti-goat (A11058; Invitrogen). Confocal imaging
was performed at the Michael Hooker Microscopy Center at
UNC-Chapel Hill, using a Zeiss Axiovert LSM 510 laser
confocal microscope. Images were processed with Zeiss LSM
Image Browser software. Dual-label immunofluorescence
images were reconstructed from at least five consecutive
steps in a z series taken at 1.3-lm intervals through the
section of interest, using a · 20 objective.
To examine MeP-mediated GFP expression in peripheral
organs, samples were prepared as for IHC described previously (48 hr of paraformaldehyde fixation, 40-lm vibratome
sections), and incubated with or without rabbit anti-GFP as
done for IHC brain samples. Both sets of tissue sections were
then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat antirabbit (A11008; Invitrogen), and then washed and mounted
to slides. GFP fluorescence was visualized with a Leica
DM IRB wide-field fluorescence microscope, using a · 20
objective.
For studies regarding the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) after
intrathecal injection, lumbar levels L2 to L6 were removed
from each animal and immersion-fixed for 4 hr in cold 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After
cryoprotection in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffer,
ganglia were sectioned at a thickness of 20 lm and collected
on SuperFrost Plus slides. Every fourth section was incubated overnight with a cocktail containing a chicken IgY to
GFP (GFP-1020, diluted 1:600; Aves Labs, Tigard, OR) and a
rabbit IgG to substance P (20064, diluted 1:600; ImmunoStar,
Hudson, WI). After several buffer rinses, slides were incubated for 3 hr with a mixture containing a goat anti-chicken
IgY coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (A11039, diluted 1:200; Invitrogen), a goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 633

1146
(A21070, diluted 1:200; Invitrogen), and isolectin GS-IB4
coupled to Alexa Fluor 568 (I21412, diluted 1:100; Invitrogen). After rinses, slides were coverslipped with Fluoro-Gel
(17985-10; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA).
Images were obtained with the UNC Neuroscience Center’s
Zeiss LSM 510 laser confocal microscope and collected as
maximal projections.
Results
Construction of a modified mini-CBA promoter,
termed CBh
Discrepancies in the literature (Duque et al., 2009; Foust
et al., 2009), our own preliminary observations, and those of
our colleagues (Snyder et al., 2011), suggested that the miniature CBA promoter expressed poorly in MNs. The miniature CBA promoter has reduced expression relative to the
full-length CAGGS promoter (data not shown), so we hypothesized that when the b-actin 5¢ UTR in the CAGGS
promoter was replaced with the truncated SV40 intron, this
resulted in reduced MN expression specifically, in addition
to the overall reduced expression. To test whether a better
version of the CBA promoter could be made, we replaced
this intron with another sequence to produce an 800-bp
modified CBA promoter with the potential for ubiquitous
expression in the CNS. The minute virus of mice (MVM) VP
intron was previously shown to provide enhanced liver expression compared with a panel of other small introns (Wu
et al., 2008), and therefore it served as an initial candidate to
replace the truncated SV40 intron. The construct resulting
from these studies replaced the SV40 intron in the CBA
promoter with a hybrid intron composed of a 5¢ donor splice
site from the chicken b-actin 5¢ UTR and a 3¢ acceptor splice
site from MVM. This new version of the chicken b-actin
‘‘promoter’’ (enhancer, promoter, and 5¢ UTR) was termed
‘‘CBh’’ for CBA hybrid intron (for construct compositions,
see Table 1).
CMV, CBA, and CBh promoters show different
expression kinetics and cell-type specificity
in cultured rat hippocampal slices
To define a time course of early CNS expression comparing the CMV, CBA, and CBh promoters, an ex vivo assay
was used to compare these AAV vectors in the rat hippocampus. Rat hippocampal organotypic slices were infected
with AAV9 vectors using a CMV, CBA, or CBh promoter
driving the expression of GFP. Promoter efficacy was monitored by evaluating GFP production daily over a 5-day time
course. All three promoters demonstrated weak fluorescence
24 hr after infection (Fig. 1P; signal-to-background ratio, 2:1).
The CMV and CBh promoters provided a significant increase
in fluorescence 48 hr after infection, and the CBA promoter
was less effective at the equivalent time point (Fig. 1). Over
the next 72 hr the CMV and CBh promoters demonstrated
equivalent GFP expression, whereas the CBA promoter system was at a consistently lower level (Fig. 1). High-resolution
images were collected on day 5 after infection to ascertain
cell specificity of expression for each promoter. These data
indicate that all three promoters (CMV, CBh, and CBA) did
not demonstrate any selectivity for cellular subtypes within
the hippocampus (data not shown). To gain better resolution

of individual cell morphology and to assess relative GFP
concentration in individual cells, a 1:100 dilution of vector
was applied to hippocampal organotypic slices and visualized for GFP expression after 5 days. Individual cells with
each promoter treatment were randomly selected and the
total GFP fluorescence intensity was plotted against the total
three-dimensional area for each cell (Fig. 2A). By binning the
cells according to size, the relative GFP concentration could
be assessed in different cell types in an unbiased fashion, and
for each promoter there was no more than a 2-fold variation
in GFP concentration among bins of different sizes. These
data indicate that the CBA, CMV, and CBh promoters express GFP at homogeneous levels within different cell types
of the hippocampus. This analysis also recapitulated the
findings in Fig. 1, that is, that the CBA promoter expresses at
consistently lower levels than the CMV or CBh promoter. No
apparent differences in cell specificity were observed by visual inspection, although the intensity of GFP expression was
reduced in CBA compared with CMV and CBh (Fig. 2B–D).
CMV, CBA, and CBh promoters differ in their in vivo
cell-specific expression profiles
To compare the CMV, CBA, and CBh promoters for cell
type-specific expression in the CNS in vivo, mice received a
tail vein injection of scAAV9/GFP vector (2 · 1011 VG), using
each of the promoters to drive GFP expression. Four weeks
later the mice were killed, and sections of the brain and
spinal cord were assessed for GFP expression. We observed
neuronal and glial expression throughout the CNS with all
promoters, but the cell-specific expression and intensity of
expression differed, in some cases substantially, on the basis
of which promoter was used (Fig. 3). Compared with the
CBA and CBh promoters, the CMV promoter showed reduced expression in hippocampal neurons 4 weeks postinjection, consistent with observations made by McCown and
colleagues and Klein and colleagues that the CMV promoter
is silenced over time in the hippocampus after direct intracranial injection (McCown et al., 1996; Klein et al., 1998). In
the striatum, however, neuronal expression from the CMV,
CBA, and CBh promoters was equivalent. In general,
throughout the entire CNS, stronger GFP expression in astrocytes was observed with the CBA and CBh promoters
than with the CMV promoter. A striking difference was seen
in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The CBA promoter
showed a small number of GFP-positive cells with neuronal
morphology, approximately two to four per 40-lm slice at
this dose. In contrast, the same dose of vector using the CMV
promoter resulted in 30–40 GFP-positive neuron-like cells
per 40-lm slice. The CBh promoter also provided a large
number of GFP-positive neuron-like cells, similar to that
observed with the CMV promoter, but an accurate count was
obscured by the large number of strongly GFP-positive astrocytes. On the basis of their morphology, large size, and
location in the ventral horn, most of these neurons appeared
to be motor neurons (MNs).

MNs and DRG, but the CBh promoter provides robust,

FIG. 1. CMV, CBh, and CBA promoters demonstrate distinct kinetics in cultured rat hippocampal slices. Rat hippocampal
slices were infected with 5 · 107 VG after 7 days in culture, and GFP expression was monitored for 5 days. The time course of
GFP expression was examined for the CMV (A–E), CBh (F–J), and CBA (K–O) promoters at five time points. All images are
mapped to the pseudo-color gray wedge depicted in (O). All images are set to equivalent scales with the scale bar in (O) set to

day. The values are scaled to account for exposure time required for each image. Note: The exposure times were adjusted to

and CBh promoters, we delivered scAAV9/GFP vectors intrathecally in mice. In the ventral horn of the lumbar spinal
cord, mice killed 3 weeks postinjection showed a cell-type
bias similar to that seen with intravenous vector administration. CMV expression was detected mostly in cells with
neuronal morphology, CBA expression was detected mostly
in cells with glial morphology, and CBh expression could be
detected in both cell types (Fig. 4, row A). In the DRG, expression was observed in multiple cell types with all three
promoters (Fig. 4, row C). At 10 weeks postinjection in the
spinal cord and DRG, expression of GFP with the scAAV9/
CMV vectors was significantly reduced, but the scAAV9/

CBh vectors showed unchanged levels of expression (Fig. 4,
rows B and D).
Within the CNS, the 229-bp murine MeCP2 promoter

The CMV and miniature CBA enhancer/promoters are
each approximately 800 bp long, making them amenable for
high expression in scAAV vectors, which have a packaging
constraint of approximately 2.2 kb of foreign DNA. Smaller
neural promoters would have an advantage for certain CNS
applications, when a larger transgene must be packed in

FIG. 2. GFP expression remains constant independent of cell size, and the CMV, CBA, and CBh promoters express in a broad
range of cells. Rat hippocampal slices were infected with 5 · 105 VG after 7 days in culture, and GFP expression was monitored
after 5 days. (A) Cell size was measured by summating the area for each cell throughout the three-dimensional data set.
Individual cells were outlined manually, and the total intensity was measured for each plane. A relative GFP concentration
was determined by dividing integrated intensity values by the summated area values. The individual cells were subsequently
binned according to summated area to depict the size of these cells. Because of the large range of cell sizes, the individual bins
increase in size based on an exponential scale. The CBA, CMV, and CBh promoters all demonstrate a homogeneous GFP
concentration independent of the size of the cell. (B–D) Images are z-stack maximal projections of native GFP fluorescence.

scAAV vectors. A promoter fragment from the murine
MeCP2 gene has been characterized as having primarily
neuronal expression, although low expression has also been
documented in glial cells (Adachi et al., 2005; Rastegar et al.,
2009). On the basis of the studies by Adachi and colleagues,
we hypothesized that the core components of the murine
MeCP2 promoter (MeP) were contained in a 229-bp fragment. An AAV construct was created to use this 229-bp
fragment to drive GFP expression. A 49-bp synthetic poly(A)
signal (Levitt et al., 1989) was also used, providing approximately 1.9 kb of space to package a foreign gene in place of
GFP in scAAV. Transfection of constructs using this promoter in HEK293 cells showed low expression relative to the
CBA and CMV promoters, indicating some potential for low
nonneuronal expression (data not shown). When packaged
into scAAV and injected intravenously into mice, the MeP
promoter provided neuron-specific gene expression in the
CNS (Fig. 5). Visualization of expression by native fluores-

cence was not readily apparent (data not shown), but positive cells were apparent by IHC and immunofluorescence
(IF), all with neuronal morphology. Co-IF with NeuN in the
hippocampus confirmed that positive cells were neurons,
and expression in spinal cord MNs was identified by colabeling with ChAT (Fig. 5). An identical expression profile
with the MeP promoter was observed at 14 weeks postinjection, indicating that MeP provides long-term expression
(Fig. 6). At 14 weeks postinjection, expression was also seen
in the liver, heart, and kidney, but not the spleen, indicating
that the promoter is not neuron specific outside of the CNS
(Fig. 7).
Discussion
Consistent with published reports (McCown et al., 1996;
Klein et al., 1998; Paterna et al., 2000; Tenenbaum et al., 2004),
we conclude from our results that AAV vectors using the

CMV promoter provide rapid and strong transgene expression that is prone to diminish significantly over time in certain cell types. The CBA promoter, for most CNS
applications, provides ubiquitous expression in a wide variety of cells. Relative to the CMV promoter, however, the
800-bp CBA promoter used in our studies expressed poorly
in MNs in the brainstem and spinal cord, resulting in an
underestimate of the number of MNs targeted by AAV9.
We genetically narrowed the cause for poor MN expression
to the approximately 200-bp SV40 intron used to reduce the
1.6-kb CAGGS promoter to 800 bp, and functionally replaced it with a hybrid intron from the chicken b-actin intron 1 and MVM VP intron. In the context of the same
AAV2 ITRs, CMV enhancer, CBA promoter, and bovine
growth hormone (BGH) poly(A), the hybrid CBA/MVM
intron supported expression in MNs comparable to the
CMV promoter and significantly better than the CBA promoter with the SV40 intron. Moreover, the CBh promoter
provided stronger expression in ex vivo rat hippocampal
slices compared with CBA. Overall, our results indicate that
the CBh promoter is a strong and ubiquitous promoter for
CNS applications, equal to or better than the CMV or CBA
promoter in these regards. It is important to clarify that our
studies used the 800-bp miniature CBA promoter, and we
would not extrapolate the findings of this study to the fulllength 1.6-kb CBA (CAGGS; Niwa et al., 1991) promoter.
Moreover, the cell-specific expression patterns observed in
these studies were influenced by the route of administration, because intraparenchymal brain injection of AAV9
leads to almost exclusive neuronal expression (Gray et al.,
2010).
Intravenous injection of scAAV9/GFP vectors leads to
extensive AAV delivery to the brain and spinal cord (Duque
et al., 2009; Foust et al., 2009). The differential promoter activity we observed in the spinal cord with CBA and CMV

could explain the discrepancies in adult mouse MN transduction reported by Foust and colleagues and Duque and
colleagues after intravenous injection (Duque et al., 2009;
Foust et al., 2009). Foust and colleagues used the CBA promoter and reported only *5% of MNs transduced at a dose
of 1 · 1014 VG/kg. Duque and colleagues used the CMV
promoter at the same dose and reported 5–19% of motor
neurons (MNs) transduced in adult mice. Our results suggest
that the higher percentage of MN transduction reported by
Duque and colleagues could be a reflection of the promoter
choice. Both reported strong MN expression when neonatal
mice were injected, which suggests that the developmental
stage also might influence promoter regulation. Furthermore,
studies with other AAV serotypes might have underestimated the extent of potential transduction. For example,
Vulchanova and colleagues tested intrathecal injections of
AAV5 and AAV8 vectors using the CBA promoter, and reported extensive transduction of DRG but only minimal
transduction of neurons in the spinal cord ventral horn
(Vulchanova et al., 2010).
When using scAAV vectors, which package only
*2.2 kb of foreign DNA, the choice of regulatory elements
such as promoters and polyadenylation signals becomes
limited. The CMV, miniature CBA, and CBh promoters
described in this study are each approximately 800 bp, and
with a 200-bp poly(A) sequence an scAAV vector will accommodate only approximately 1.2 kb of coding sequence.
The neuron-specific synapsin and weak ubiquitous bglucuronidase (GUSB) promoters are smaller alternatives
at 480 and 378 bp, respectively (Shipley et al., 1991; Kügler
et al., 2003; Husain et al., 2009). The 229-bp murine MeCP2
promoter in these studies offers additional packaging
space as well as long-term, weak, and neuron-specific
expression. MeCP2 is a transcriptional regulator expressed
primarily in neurons in the CNS, although it is also

mately 1.9 kb of genome capacity remained to package a
transgene coding sequence in an scAAV vector. This extra
packaging capacity could be critical for packaging therapeutic genes such as gigaxonin (1797 bp) for giant axonal
neuropathy or tripeptidyl-peptidase I (1686 bp) for neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Moreover, the low expression
levels could be necessary when overexpression of the gene
product could be deleterious, such as for Rett syndrome
and fragile X syndrome (Peier et al., 2000; Collins et al.,
2004).
In summary, these studies demonstrate potential confounders that can arise from variable promoter tropisms. We
conclude that the 800-bp CBh promoter we developed is a
ubiquitous promoter that is advantageous overall, relative to
the CMV and CBA promoters, in terms of the range of cell
types transduced, the strength of expression, and the duration of expression. We further report that the 229-bp MeP
promoter fragment, when used in AAV vectors in the CNS,
displays primarily low-level neuronal expression along with
an advantageous small size.
