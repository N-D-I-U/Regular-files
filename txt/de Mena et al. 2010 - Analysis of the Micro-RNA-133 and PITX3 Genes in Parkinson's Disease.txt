MicroRNAs are small RNA sequences that negatively regulate
gene expression by binding to the 30 untranslated regions of
mRNAs. MiR-133b has been implicated in Parkinson’s disease
(PD) by a mechanism that involves the regulation of the transcription factor PITX3. The variation in these genes could
contribute to the risk of developing PD. We searched for DNA
variants in miR-133 and PITX3 genes in PD patients and healthy
controls from Spain. We found common DNA variants in the
three miR-133 genes. Genotyping of a ﬁrst set of patients
(n ¼ 777) and controls (n ¼ 650) showed a higher frequency of
homozygous for a miR-133b variant (90 del A) in PD-patients
(6/575; 1%) than in healthy controls (0/650) (P ¼ 0.03). However,
this association was not conﬁrmed in a second set of patients
(1/250; 0.4%) and controls (2/210; 1%). No common PITX3
variants were associated with PD, although a rare missense
change (G32S) was found in only one patient and none of the
controls. In conclusion, we report the variation in genes of a
pathway that has been involved in dopaminergic neuron differentiation and survival. Our work suggests that miR-133 and
PITX3 gene variants did not contribute to the risk for PD.

processed to the single-strand mature miRNA. Mature miRNAs
are incorporated into the RNA induced silencing complex that
regulates mRNA expression [Bartel, 2004].
MiRNAs can play a role in dopaminergic neurons (DN) differentiation and survival [Kosik, 2006; Hebert and De Strooper, 2007].
A quantitative analysis of 224 miRNAs identiﬁed a loss of miR-133b
expression in PD subjects. This miRNA was speciﬁcally expressed in
the midbrain of normal mice and markedly reduced in mice
dopamine-deﬁciency models, and regulates the maturation and
function of DNs within a negative feedback circuit that includes the
transcription factor Pitx3 [Kim et al., 2007]. Recent reports
have provided evidence for the association between PITX3 polymorphisms and PD [Bergman et al., 2008; Fuchs et al., 2009;
Haubenberger et al., 2009; Le et al., 2009].
DNA variants at miRNA genes and at the 30 UTR regions where
miRNAs bind have been associated with the risk for diseases [Duan
et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009]. A DNA polymorphism in the 30 UTR of
FGF20 that disrupted a binding site for miR-433 and increased the
translation of FGF20 was associated with PD [Wang et al., 2008].
However, this association was not detected by other authors
[Clarimon et al., 2005; Wider et al., 2009].
We hypothesized that DNA variants in the miRNA-133 and
PITX3 genes could contribute to the risk for PD. We searched for
DNA variants in these miRNA genes in PD-patients, and compared
the genotype frequencies between patients and healthy controls.

METHODS
Patients and Controls
The study included a total of 1,027 Parkinson’s patients (mean age at
diagnosis 58  13 years; 52% male) recruited in the period
2002–2008 by Neurologists from the Movement Disorder Units of
four reference Hospitals (Central de Asturias, Mieres, Aviles,
and Clınica Universitaria Pamplona) from two regions in Spain:
Asturias and Navarra. The control group consisted of 860 healthy
individuals (mean age 59  16 years; 54% male). These controls were
from the general population, Hospital staff, or spouses of the patients,
and did not have symptoms of PD or any other neurodegenerative
disorder. However, they were not subjected to a detailed examination

by a specialist on movement disorders to exclude the existence of
asymptomatic PD. The cohort from Asturias was composed by
777 patients (mean age at diagnosis 58  13 years) and 650 controls
(58  18 years), and the cohort from Navarra consisted on
250 patients (mean age at diagnosis 57  12) and 210 controls
(72  9 years) (Table I). Patients and controls were Spanish Caucasians and signed an informed consent to participate in the study,
approved by the Ethical Committee of Hospital Central Asturias.

Analysis of miRNA-133a-1, -133a-2,
and -133b Genes
Genomic DNA was obtained from 10 ml of blood, and 350–450
nucleotides of the miR-133a-1, 133a-2, and 133b genes were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-ampliﬁed with primers derived from
the corresponding sequences in the Ensembl database
(www.ensembl.org) (Supplementary Table). The genetic analysis was
performed in two steps: search for DNA variants and genotyping of
speciﬁc variants. To search for DNA variants the PCR fragments from
350 patients and 200 controls (randomly chosen from total patients
and controls) were analyzed through denaturing high performance
liquid chromatography (DHPLC) in a Varian Helix system, and
eluted with a linear binary gradient created with buffers Varian Helix
A (triethylammonium amine—TEAA) and B (TEAA þ 25%
acetonitrile) (www.varianinc.org). Primers and PCR and DHPLC
conditions are available upon request to the corresponding author. To
identify the nucleotide changes, fragments with multiple elution
peaks were sequenced using BigDye chemistry in an automated
ABI3130 capillary system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Genotyping of miR-133 Polymorphisms
To determine the association between three DNA variants in the
miR-133a-1, -133a-2, and -133b, we genotyped 575 patients and
650 controls through PCR-RFLP: a PCR-fragment was digested
with a restriction enzyme which target sequence was affected by the
nucleotide change, followed by electrophoresis on 3% agarose gels
to visualize the different alleles. Because we found an statistical
trend toward the association of the miRNA-133b polymorphism

Patients with a family history of PD were those with at least one or second degree relative also diagnosed with PD. Patients with an age at the onset of symptoms 50 years had an early onset PD (see
http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/parkinsons_disease for the diagnostic criteria and the deﬁnition of early and late-onset PD). The frequencies of carriers of the common LRRK2 mutations are also

and PD, we extended the genotyping of this variant to a total of
1,027 patients and 860 controls.
For the 133a1 þ85 A/C variant the DNA was PCR ampliﬁed with
primers CAGTGACTGAAGCATTGGTATGATAA (forward) and
AAGTTATTTGATTATAATCACA GTCTGCTT (reverse). The reverse primer had a mismatched nucleotide in the penultimate
position (T instead of A) to introduce and AﬂII site (CTTAAG)
on fragments with þ85 C. After digestion with this enzyme and
electrophoresis on agarose gels, alleles were visualized as fragments
of 360 bp (A) or 330 þ 30 bp (C). The 133a2 191 G/A polymorphism was genotyped by digestion with MspI (CCGG) of a PCR
fragment generated with primers 133a2 F and R (Supplementary
Table). In addition to two constant fragments of 55 and 35 bp,
alleles were visualized as bands of 354 bp (A) and 212 þ 142 bp (G).
The 133b 90 ins/del A was genotyped by MboI (GATC) digestion
of PCR fragments generated with primers 133b F and R
(Supplementary Table). Alleles were visualized as fragments of
306 bp (insA) and 231 þ 75 bp (delA).

PITX3 Genotyping
We searched for DNA variants in the entire coding and 30 UTR
sequence of PITX3 (exons 2–4) in 350 patients and 250 controls
through single strand conformation analysis (SSCA). Brieﬂy, fragments 300–450 bp were ampliﬁed (see the primers in the Supplementary Table), and subjected to SSCA as reported [Garcıa-Castro
et al., 2003; Gasser et al., 2007]. Fragments that showed different
SSCA patterns were sequenced to determine the nucleotide variation. To determine the frequency of the G32S variant, SSCA of the
exon 2 fragment was performed on 1,027 patients and 860 controls.

LRRK2 R1441G and G2019S Genotyping
All the patients were characterized for three LRRK2 mutations:
R1441G and R1441C in exon 31 and G2019S in exon 41 [Mata et al.,
2006]. Genomic DNA was PCR-ampliﬁed with primers that
matched intronic sequences ﬂanking exons 31 and 41 of LRRK2,
followed by sequencing. Primers and PCR and sequencing conditions for the analysis for these mutations are available upon
request to the corresponding author.

Statistical Analysis
Allele and genotype frequencies in patients and controls were
compared through a Chi-squared test. For those comparisons with
any expected frequency below 1, we used the Yate’s correction.
The Chi-squared was also used to analyze the deviation from the
Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium of the genotype frequencies. The
ANOVA was used to compare the mean age between the groups. All
statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS statistical package
(v.11.0). A P < 0.01 was considered as statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
MiRNA-133 Variation
DHPLC analysis of 350 PD-patients and 200 controls showed multiple elution peaks for the 133a-1, 133a-2, and 133b PCR-fragments.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART B
We found two new (non previously reported) polymorphisms:
90 ins/del A in 133b and þ85 A/C in 133a-1. In the 133a-2 gene
we found four previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs): 191 G/A (SNP rs45547937), 171G/A (rs13040566), 88
G/A (rs13040413), and þ78 T/C (rs6062251). We sequenced 30
patients and 30 controls and found that they were homozygous for
the 191/171/88 polymorphisms (191AA/171AA/88AA,
or 191GG/171GG/88GG), or heterozygous for these SNPs. This
suggested that the three 133a-2 SNPs were in complete linkage
disequilibrium (LD), deﬁning two haplotypes: 191A/171A/
88A and 191G/-171G/-88G. We found þ78 T/C heterozygotes
among individuals homozygotes for the 191G/171G/88G haplotype, but all the 191AA/171AA/88AA were also þ78CC.

MiRNA-133 Genotype Frequencies
We genotyped three nucleotide variants in the miR-133a-1, 133a-2
(rs45547937), and 133b in 575 patients and 650 controls. Allele and
genotype frequencies for the 133a-1 and 133a-2 SNPs did not differ
between PD-patients and controls. Homozygotes for the miR-133b
90 delA were more frequent among the patients (6/575, 1% vs. 0/
650; P ¼ 0.03) (Table II). This suggested that homozygosity for 90
delA could be a risk factor for PD. We extended the analysis of this
variant to a total of 1,027 patients and 860 controls (including
patients/controls from a second population) and we found two
healthy controls (aged 66 an 78 years) who were delA-homozygotes.
We evaluated these controls to exclude they had symptoms of PD.
In addition, they did not have a family history of PD. Although the
frequency of 90 delA/delA was higher among the patients, the

difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (P ¼ 0.03)
(Table III).
To exclude that incomplete restriction enzyme digestion could
result mistyping of some delA homozygotes (that should be genotyped as heterozygotes), we conﬁrmed the genotype for all the
delA/insA patients and controls by DHPLC analysis, obtaining a
two elution peak that conﬁrmed the heterozygosisty for all these
samples.
All the patients were genotyped for three LRRK2 mutations
associated with PD: R1441G, R1441C, and G2019S were found in
4% of the patients from Asturias and in 6% of the patients from
Navarra. In Table III we summarized the 133b frequencies in
patients with and without these LRRK2 mutations.

PITX3 Variation
We searched for PITX3 variants in a total of 350 patients and 250
controls. The full coding and 30 UTR sequence was ampliﬁed with
primers that matched the intronic ﬂanking regions, and subjected
to SSCA. Fragments from exons 2 and 3 showed heterogeneous
SSCA patterns, and after sequencing we characterized ﬁve nucleotide variants: c.94G>T (exon 2), G32>S, IVS þ6 bp C>T (intron
2), IVS þ70 bp G>T (intron 3), IVS þ71 bp C>T (intron 3), and
c.285 T/C (SNP rs2281983; exon 3, silent for I 95). The three
intronic nucleotide changes were new and only found in one patient
and one control. SNP rs2281983 had been previously described and
allele and genotype frequencies did not differ between patients and
controls, suggesting that this variant did not contribute to PD risk.

In addition, rs2281983 allele and genotype frequencies did not
differ between early-onset and late-onset patients, or between
patients with and without a family history of PD (data not shown).
The exon 2 c.93G>T was a missense change (G32S) found in only
one of the 1,027 patients (a 52 years old female, negative for the two
LRRK2 mutations, and without relatives affected by PD). Its
absence among the 860 controls and the fact that 32G was conserved
among species suggests a contribution of this PITX3 change to PD
in this patient, although functional studies should be necessary to
conﬁrm a functional effect.

DISCUSSION
Micro RNA 133b and pitx3 have been involved in dopamine
neurons survival in mice. MiRNA-133b was speciﬁcally expressed
in midbrain DNs and was deﬁcient in midbrain tissue from patients
with PD [Kim et al., 2007]. MiRNA-133b binds to the 30 UTR of
pitx3, a transcription factor that regulates the maturation and
function of midbrain DNs. Pitx3 in turn binds to the miRNA133b promoter, enhancing its expression. This negative feedback
circuit could be essential to maintain DNs survival, and its deregulation could result in behaviors related with dopaminergic loss, such
as locomotion [Kosik, 2006; Hebert and De Strooper, 2007; Kim
et al., 2007]. The human genes that encode miRNA-133b and PITX3
are thus candidates to modify the risk for PD. In this report we
searched for DNA variants in the three miRNA-133 and the PITX3
genes, and analyzed the association between these gene variants and
PD.

We ﬁrst searched for DNA variants in PD patients and healthy
controls, and found several nucleotide changes in PITX3 and
miRNA-133b, 133a-1, and 133a-2. We used DHPLC and SSCA to
analyze the variation in PCR-fragments, two indirect techniques
with a low rate for false negatives [Buyse et al., 2000; Garcıa-Castro
et al., 2003; Gasser et al., 2007]. Thus, we cannot exclude that some
DNA variants in the four genes were not identiﬁed in our study. We
compared the allele and genotype frequencies for three miRNA-133
variants between PD patients and controls. Allele and genotype
frequencies for two miRNA-133a-1 (þ85 A/C) and 133a-2
(rs45547937) polymorphisms did not differ between the two
groups. We cannot exclude an association between the three
133a-2 SNPs (rs13040566, rs13040413, and rs6062251) not
genotyped in our patients and controls, although this is unlikely
for the 171 G/A and 88 G/A that were in complete linkage
disequilibrium with 191 G/A.
In a ﬁrst comparison of 575 patients and 650 controls, homozygotes for the rare miRNA-133b 90 delA were signiﬁcantly more
frequent among the patients. However, this difference was based on
the absence of 90 delA/delA among the controls. We extended the
analysis to a second set of 452 patients and 210 controls, and
we found also two 90 delA homozygotes among the controls.
These homozygous controls were 66 and 78 years old, above the
mean age of delA/delA patients (55 years; range 35–66) and they did
not have symptoms of PD. Thus, although we found a higher
frequency of the 90 delA/delA among the patients the difference
with the controls was not signiﬁcant, and this suggested that
miRNA-133b variants did not contribute to the risk for PD.
Our search for PITX3 variants identiﬁed ﬁve nucleotide variants.
One was a reported SNP in exon 3 (rs2281983, silent for I 95I), and
allele and genotype frequencies did not differ between patients and
controls. Three intronic PITX3 nucleotide changes were found in
only one patient and one control, and a missense change in exon 2
(c.94 G>T, G32S) was found in only one patient and none of the
controls. We determined the presence of this change in a total of 1,027
patients and 860 controls, and we did not ﬁnd the rare c.94T in the
controls. This, in addition to the conservation of 32G among species,
suggested that 32S could be associated with PD in this patient.
Two recent reports described a positive associations between a
SNP (rs3758549) in the PITX3 promoter and PD [Fuchs et al., 2009;
Haubenberger et al., 2009]. However, a third study failed to
replicate this association [Bergman et al., 2008]. A study involving
265 patients and 210 controls reported an association between SNP
rs2281983 and PD, and the association was more robust among
early onset patients [Le et al., 2009]. In our population, allele
and genotype frequencies for this PITX3 polymorphism did not
differ between patients and controls, or between early-onset and
late-onset patients.
Finally, several genome wide association (GWA) studies have
identiﬁed a number of SNPs signiﬁcantly associated to PD [Fung et
al., 2006; Gao et al., 2009; Latourelle et al., 2009; Maraganore
et al., 2005]. Two recent reports conﬁrmed the association to
known genes (i.e., SNCA and MAPT), and identiﬁed two new risk
regions on 1q32 and 4p15 [Satake et al., 2009; Sim
on-Sanchez et al.,
2009]. Consistent with our results, none of these GWA studies
identiﬁed the regions containing the three miRNA-133 and the
PITX3 genes associated with PD.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS PART B
In conclusion, we report a search for DNA variants in the miRNA
-133 and PITX3 genes in PD patients. We did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant
associations between these genes variants and PD-risk. Overall, our
data indicate that mutations/polymorphisms in these genes involved in dopaminergic neurons survival did not contribute to the
risk of suffering PD.
