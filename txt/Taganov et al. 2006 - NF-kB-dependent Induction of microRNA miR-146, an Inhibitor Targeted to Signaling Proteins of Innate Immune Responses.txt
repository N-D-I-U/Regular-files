Activation of mammalian innate and acquired immune responses
must be tightly regulated by elaborate mechanisms to control their
onset and termination. MicroRNAs have been implicated as negative regulators controlling diverse biological processes at the level
of posttranscriptional repression. Expression profiling of 200 microRNAs in human monocytes revealed that several of them
(miR-146a兾b, miR-132, and miR-155) are endotoxin-responsive
genes. Analysis of miR-146a and miR-146b gene expression unveiled a pattern of induction in response to a variety of microbial
components and proinflammatory cytokines. By means of promoter analysis, miR-146a was found to be a NF-␬B-dependent
gene. Importantly, miR-146a兾b were predicted to base-pair with
sequences in the 3ⴕ UTRs of the TNF receptor-associated factor 6
and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 genes, and we found that
these UTRs inhibit expression of a linked reporter gene. These
genes encode two key adapter molecules downstream of Toll-like
and cytokine receptors. Thus, we propose a role for miR-146 in
control of Toll-like receptor and cytokine signaling through a
negative feedback regulation loop involving down-regulation of
IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 protein levels.

nnate immunity is the first line of host defense, designed to
recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns represented by conserved components of microorganisms unique to
the microbial world. The pathogen molecules are detected via a
limited number of germ line-encoded receptors expressed in
immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. In the last
decade, members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family have
emerged as the primary evolutionarily conserved sensors of
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (1). Binding of the
TLRs to their respective ligands initiates a wide spectrum of
responses from phagocytosis to production of a variety of
cytokines, which in turn shape and enhance the inflammatory
and adaptive immune responses.
All TLR receptors trigger signals in a similar fashion because of
the presence of Toll and IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains in their
cytoplasmic tails. The signaling cascade of TLR4, the founding
member of the family and a sensor of LPS, is initiated when adaptor
proteins MyD88 and TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing
IFN-␤ (TRIF) are recruited to the receptor, activating two independent branches of TLR signaling. MyD88 serves as a bridge
between TLR4 and IL-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK1) that
then recruits into the complex TNF receptor-associated factor 6
(TRAF6). This chain of events triggers activation of I␬B kinase and
JNK and, in turn, the downstream NF-␬B and AP-1 transcription
factors and results in up-regulation of immune-responsive genes (2).
The TRIF-dependent branch of signaling leads to the activation of
another group of transcription factors, the IRF family, and results
in a boost of expression of IFNs and other genes.
TLRs are double-edged swords because abnormal activation of
their signaling can be deleterious. Thus, it is not surprising that a
distinct group of TLR-activated genes is involved in modulation of
www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0605298103

TLR signal transduction by interfering with upstream signaling
pathways. Several classes of negative regulators of the TLR system
have been described in the past: soluble decoy receptors (sTLR2兾
4), cell-surface transmembrane receptors (ST2, SIGRR, and
TRAILR), and numerous intracellular proteins: IRAK-M, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), MyD88 short (MyD88s),
inhibitor of NF-␬B (I␬B), and A20 (3).
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an evolutionarily conserved class of
endogenous ⬇22-nt noncoding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional gene repression (4–6). In animals, miRNAs are processed
from long primary transcripts [pri-miRNAs (pri-miR)] through an
⬇60-bp hairpin precursor step [pre-miRNAs (pre-miR)] into the
mature forms by sequential cutting with two RNase III enzymes,
Drosha and Dicer (7, 8). Mature miRNAs are then loaded onto the
ribonucleoprotein complex dubbed RISC (RNA-induced silencing
complex), where they guide the recognition and translational
repression or degradation of target mRNAs. pri-miRNAs are
transcribed by RNA polymerase II and thus are subject to regulation by the assortment of transcription factors in the cell (9–11).
Whereas some miRNAs are widely expressed, others exhibit only
limited developmental stage-, tissue-, or cell type-specific patterns
(12). In mammals, miRNAs have been associated with diverse
biological processes, such as cell differentiation (13–15), cancer
(16–18), regulation of insulin secretion (19), and viral infection (20,
21). Studies in plants have shown that miRNAs can be involved in
responses to a variety of environmental stresses (22–25). However,
understanding of the regulation and function of the bulk of miRNA
genes await further investigation.
To examine the potential involvement of miRNAs in regulation of the innate immune response, we analyzed expression of
200 miRNAs after exposure of THP-1 cells to LPS. We show that
production of mature forms for several of them (miR-146a兾b,
miR-132, and miR-155) is induced, and we provide here a
detailed profile of expression of one miRNA family from this
group (miR-146a兾b) in response to various microbial components and proinflammatory mediators. Promoter analysis of the
miR-146a gene revealed that NF-␬B plays a critical role in
induction of its transcription by LPS, TNF␣, and IL-1␤. In
addition, we have determined that TRAF6 and IRAK1 represent potential molecular targets of miR-146 through experiments
with 3⬘ UTR luciferase reporters. These findings suggest that
miR-146a兾b may function as novel negative regulators that help
to fine-tune the immune response.

transiently transfected with pcDNA3 vector or expression plasmids for either pre-miR-146a or pre-miR-146b (marked as C, A, and B, respectively). (The faint bands

Results
To identify miRNA genes whose expression might be regulated by
innate immunity receptors, we analyzed the expression profile of
the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 using a DNA
microarray containing 200 oligonucleotide probes complementary
to mature forms of miRNAs of human, mouse, and rat origin. After
an LPS challenge, the array revealed up-regulation in the expression
of the miR-146, miR-155, and miR-132 genes (Fig. 1A). This result
was validated by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis of levels of
miR-146, miR-155, and miR-132 in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells
using primers that recognize their respective mature forms (data
not shown). miR-146 was chosen for detailed analysis in the present
study.
The rapid induction of miR-146 in response to LPS, as shown by
qPCR, suggested that miR-146 might be an LPS primary-response
gene (Fig. 1B). Its expression reached a plateau ⬇8 h after LPS
challenge.

The human genome contains two miR-146 genes [miR-146a (26)
and miR-146b (27)] on chromosomes 5 and 10, respectively, and
their mature products differ only by 2 nt in the 3⬘ region (Fig. 4,
which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web
site). To study them individually using qPCR proved difficult
because primers were unable to distinguish between the mature
species (data not shown). Thus, we resorted to Northern blot
analysis using DNA oligonucleotide probes complementary to the
mature sequences. Hybridization of total RNA from 293兾IL1R兾
MD2兾TLR4 cells expressing either pre-miR-146a or pre-miR-146b
under the control of the CMV promoter confirmed the ability of the
probes to discriminate between the two miR-146 isoforms (Fig. 1C,
lanes 5–7). Northern blot analysis of miR-146a expression in two
human cell lines of myeloid origin (THP-1 and HL-60) has shown
that it is strongly induced after 8 h of LPS treatment (Fig. 1C Top,
lanes 1–4). By this method, miR-146b could not be detected before
or after induction (Middle). As a control, miR-16 was not affected
by LPS (Bottom). Levels of LPS-induced miR-146a comparable to

origin, e.g., human U937, Mono-Mac-6, and mouse WEHI-3 (data
not shown). At the same time, human B cell lines Ramos, Bjab, and
Namalwa showed no increase in mature miR-146a levels in response to LPS (data not shown).
LPS signals through TLR4 (28), a member of the Toll family of
pattern-recognition receptors, which consists of 10 members in
humans (29). We investigated whether miR-146a兾b expression
might be regulated by other TLRs as well as the proinflammatory
cytokines IL-1␤ and TNF␣. Ultrapure LPS (from Escherichia coli
strain K12 and Salmonella minnesota) consistently produced lower
levels of miR-146 up-regulation than did crude preparations of LPS
(Fig. 1D), suggesting that other components of the bacterial cell wall
in crude preparations of LPS might contribute to miR-146 induction. Indeed, we found that miR-146 expression was significantly
induced after exposure of THP-1 cells to peptidoglycan and its
synthetic analog, Pam3CSK4, both of which trigger TLR2 signaling
Taganov et al.

(Fig. 1D). Peptidoglycan is characteristic of both Gram-negative
and Gram-positive bacteria but is highly enriched in the bacterial
cell wall of the latter. Treatment of THP-1 cells with flagellin, a
major component of the bacterial flagellar filament and agonist of
the TLR5 receptor, also resulted in increased miR-146 expression
(Fig. 1D). In contrast, stimulation of TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 by
their respective agonistic ligands did not affect miR-146 expression
(Fig. 1D). Proinflammatory cytokines TNF␣ and IL-1␤ produced
modest increases in miR-146 levels in THP-1 cells, whereas treatment with CD40L or with the phorbol myristyl acetate兾ionomycin
combination showed no effect.
Human miR-146a resides in the LOC285628 gene on human
chromosome 5. Analysis of the two ESTs encompassing
LOC285628 (GenBank accession nos. BQ430527 and BQ425371)
suggests that the gene consists of two exons separated by ⬇16 kb of
genomic sequence, with the mature miR-146a sequence situated in
the second exon (Fig. 2A). Notably, the LOC285628 transcript

contains no significant ORF, implying that it probably belongs to a
class of noncoding RNAs. Using the 3⬘- and 5⬘-RACE technique we
confirmed the two-exon structure of the miR-146a primary transcript (pri-miR146a). However, we noticed that its previous characterization was incomplete, and its full length is, in fact, 2,337 bp.
Human miR-146b is located on chromosome 10, yet its sequence
is not included in any of the previously cloned ESTs. Our 5⬘-RACE
results indicate that its transcript consists of only one exon with the
transcription start site located ⬇700 bp upstream of the mature
miR-146b sequence (Fig. 2 A).
To determine the effect of LPS on pri-miR-146a expression, we
analyzed total RNA from LPS-stimulated and control THP-1 cells
by Northern blot with a probe corresponding to pre-miR146a. We
found that whereas the basal level of pri-miR-146a expression is
undetectable in untreated cells, exposure of THP-1 cells to LPS for
8 h resulted in the appearance of four distinct bands. Two of these
bands were of high molecular weight (⬎9 kb), probably corresponding to unspliced miR-146a transcripts, whereas one of the lower
bands with the calculated size of 2.3 kb exactly matched the size of
pri-miR-146a determined by our RACE experiments (Fig. 2B).
Analysis of the same RNAs from THP-1 cells with a pre-miR-146b
probe revealed that the primary transcript of this miRNA is also
inducible by LPS despite our inability to visualize its mature form.
To understand the pathway by which pri-miR-146a was induced
by LPS, we first characterized the miR-146a promoter region using
the Genomatix MatInspector software package, focusing on those
transcription factors that are common to TLR4, IL-1␤, and TNF␣
signaling. A scan of 1.5 kb of genomic sequence located upstream
of the predicted pri-miR-146a start site identified three putative
NF-␬B (30) and two IRF3兾IRF7 consensus binding sites (31) (Fig.
2 A). One of the identified IRF3兾7 sites overlaps with the site for
C兾EBP␤ (NF-IL6) (32). We examined the role of the predicted
transcriptional binding sites in induction of miR-146a expression by
generating a series of miR-146a promoter constructs (Fig. 2 A) and
testing them in a luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 2C, a
miR-146a promoter is found in the upstream 550 bp, and its LPS
responsiveness is totally dependent on the NF-␬B binding sites.
Activation of the miR-146a promoter construct by TNF␣ and IL-1␤
was also impaired by mutations in these sites (Fig. 2C). In contrast,
we found no role for the IRF3兾7 site because mutations of the site
had no effect on induction of the luciferase reporter (Fig. 2C).

To study the functional consequences of miR-146 induction by
LPS we searched for predicted mRNA target sites. 3⬘ UTRs of
mRNAs encoding IRAK1, TRAF6, and COT兾Tpl2兾MAP3K8
proteins were found to contain miR-146 target sequences by several
prediction algorithms (33–36). Whereas COT兾Tpl2兾MAP3K8
mRNA had only one miR-146 target sequence, TRAF6 and
IRAK1 mRNAs contained multiple sites (Fig. 5, which is published
as supporting information on the PNAS web site). IRAK1 and
TRAF6 are key adapter molecules in TLR and IL-1 receptor
signaling cascades, mediating activation of NF-␬B and AP-1 pathways. COT兾Tpl2 is a serine兾threonine protein kinase that is
essential for ERK activation downstream of TLRs IL-1 and TNF
receptors (37).
To test the possibility that expression of these three miR-146a兾b
target genes is regulated posttranscriptionally by miR-146, we
generated reporter constructs that contain the firefly luciferase
gene fused to ⬇500 bp of the 3⬘ UTRs from IRAK1, TRAF6, and
COT1 mRNAs containing putative miR-146 target sites (IRAK1UTR, TRAF6-UTR, and COT1-UTR, respectively) (Fig. 5). These
reporter constructs were transiently transfected into 293 cells
together with an expression plasmid for either miR-146a or miR146b under the control of the CMV promoter. We observed a
marked reduction in luciferase levels in cells coexpressing miR-146a
together with IRAK1-UTR and TRAF6-UTR (Fig. 3A). In contrast, no changes in COT1-UTR reporter plasmid expression were
observed in the presence of miR-146a. We also found that miR146b is capable of repressing the IRAK1-UTR and TRAF6-UTR
reporter constructs despite having a 2-nt difference from miR-146a
at its 3⬘ end. Specificity of the miR-146a兾b effect on IRAK1-UTR
and TRAF6-UTR reporters was suggested by the lack of change of
their levels of expression in the presence of an irrelevant miRNA,
miR-21. Moreover, mutation of 4 nt in the miR-146a兾b target
sequences led to a complete abrogation of the negative effect of
these miRNAs on expression of IRAK1-UTR and TRAF6-UTR
reporter constructs (Fig. 3). These data suggest that the IRAK1 and
TRAF6 genes are targets for posttranscriptional repression by
miR-146a兾b in vivo.

regulation of the miR-146 genes, which, upon processing, could
down-regulate levels of IRAK1 and TRAF6 proteins, reducing the
activity of the pathway. It is noteworthy that in this scenario the
TRIF-dependent, antiviral pathway induced by TLR4 and others
will remain intact. In agreement with current knowledge on the
miRNA mode of inhibition, it seems likely that miR-146 regulatory
circuit fine-tunes TLR and cytokine signaling, rather than totally
abrogating the signal. Loss of function and overexpression studies
in cell culture as well as in animal models will help to identify the
exact role for miR-146 in immune and inflammatory responses.
Thorough analysis of the regulatory mechanisms maintaining the
balance of TLR signaling can identify key pathway molecules and
contribute to rational target selection for therapeutic intervention.

strongly or for too long the response can be harmful, causing the
pathological manifestations of both acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. Thus, cells of the immune system must employ a
multilayered control system to keep innate immunity and inflammation in check. Although some of these negative regulation
mechanisms have been uncovered in the past (3), we are probably
far from unveiling the last of them. Here we report the discovery
of a potentially new class of TLR and cytokine receptor signaling
regulators: miRNAs.
We have identified by means of expression profiling several
miRNA genes, namely miR-146a兾b, miR-132, and miR-155, which
are induced in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 by LPS, as well
as other microbial components and proinflammatory mediators.
Through promoter studies we have determined that LPS-mediated
elevation of miR-146a expression occurs in an NF-␬B-dependent
manner. Finally, we have identified IRAK1 and TRAF6 as target
genes of miR-146 posttranslational repression, suggesting a novel
mechanism of negative feedback regulation of TLR and cytokine
receptor signaling.
Induction of miR-146a兾b by the TLR system displays a suggestive
pattern: TLRs that recognize bacterial constituents and reside on
the cell surface (1, 38) (like TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5) trigger
miR-146a兾b induction; those TLRs that mainly sense viral nucleic
acids and localize intracellularly (1, 38) (TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9)
have little effect on miR-146a兾b expression.
The dual occurrence of miR-146 found in humans is not evolutionarily conserved. Search of the miRNA registry (release 7.1) (39)
reveals that the chicken and fish genomes also have two copies of
miR-146 but that rodents possess only one (Fig. 4). All miR-146
species that have been cloned differ by only 1 or 2 nt at their 3⬘ end,
a region that is believed to play only a compensatory role in the
target recognition mechanism (33). It will be interesting to determine whether these minor variations in miR-146a and miR-146b
sequences affect their target specificity and physiological role or
whether these two genes have redundant functions and are only
differentially regulated at the transcriptional and transcript processing levels.
The results from computational miRNA target prediction algorithms included many more potential targets than we tested, but the
TRAF6 and IRAK1 genes yielded particularly high scores. Thus,
miR-146, like many mammalian miRNAs, may target a wide
spectrum of gene targets, suggesting that it could be involved in
regulation of multiple independent physiological processes. It is
noteworthy that miR-146 already has been implicated in a number
of cellular processes (14, 40, 41), and it will be important to
determine whether all of them converge on TRAF6 and IRAK1
and perhaps a few other targets.
It has been reported that miR-146a expression might be involved
in cell fate determination in mouse lymphocytes, because its level
is substantially increased in T helper 1 cells and decreased in T
helper 2 cells relative to its expression in naı̈ve T cells (14). T helper
1 differentiation and secretion of IFN␥ by this T cell subset are
controlled primarily by the synergistic action of the IL-12 and IL-18
cytokines (42), thus suggesting a possible explanation for the
elevated levels of miR-146a in T helper 1 cells. IL-18 receptor
triggers NF-␬B signaling among other pathways and employs
TRAF6 and IRAK1 for its activation (43). On the other hand,
miR-146a transcription might also be regulated by the STAT family,
which mediates IL-12 effects in T cells (42).
Although the inflammatory response is valuable for dealing with
pathogens, it takes a toll on the body and, if unregulated, can lead
to serious disease. Thus, understanding the negative regulators of
the response is critically important. Most of the studied attenuating
mechanisms of inflammation involve negative transcriptional feedback loops, like the proteins I␬B and A20 (3). We can now add
miRNAs to the list of potential negative regulators of inflammation.
This is a feedback system whereby bacterial components induce

miRNA expression was measured and quantified by using the
mirVana qRT-PCR miRNA Detection Kit (Ambion) or by TaqMan MicroRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)
according to the manufacturers’ protocol and normalized by 5S
rRNA levels.
Northern Blot Analysis and Cloning of miR-146a兾b Primary Transcripts.

Cells were starved for 24 h before stimulation in RPMI medium
1640 containing 0.5% FBS and then stimulated with LPS for 8 h.
Total RNA was isolated from cells by using the mirVana miRNA
Isolation kit (Ambion) or TRI-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). For detection of mature miRNA species, 20
␮g of total RNA was loaded on 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gel
along with ␥-32P-labeled Decade Marker (Ambion) and transferred
to GeneScreenPlus membrane (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) by
electrotransfer using semidry Transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were hybridized in ULTRAhyb-Oligo
solution (Ambion) as recommended by the manufacturer using
␥-32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotide probes complementary to mature forms of tested miRNAs. For pri-miR-146a兾b detection, 15 ␮g
of total RNA was separated on 1.2% formaldehyde-containing
agarose gel and transferred to GeneScreenPlus membrane by
capillary transfer. Hybridizations were performed in ULTRAhyb
solution (Ambion) with probes corresponding to pre-miR-146a兾b.
The probes were ␣-32P-labeled with the HexaLabel DNA Labeling
Kit (Fermentas, Hanover, MD). To determine the sequence of
pri-miR-146a兾b, we carried out 3⬘- and 5⬘-RACE using the
SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH, Mountain
View, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

bp) corresponding to pre-miR-146a兾b isoforms and pre-miR-21
were amplified from human genomic DNA and cloned into expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). When transfected into 293兾IL-1R兾TLR4兾MD2 cells, these constructs produce
mature miRNA, as assessed by Northern blot and qPCR. For
promoter luciferase reporter assays, 293兾IL-1R兾TLR4兾MD2 cells
were plated at 105 cells per well in 24-well dishes and transfected
24 h later by the calcium phosphate method. Each transfection
reaction contained 100 ng of miR-146a promoter fragment in
pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and 200 ng of pcDNA3
as carrier. For normalization of transfection efficiency and extract
recovery, all samples included 10 ng of the pCSK-lacZ vector, which
constitutively expresses ␤-galactosidase and is unaffected by NF␬B. Luciferase and ␤-galactosidase activities were measured as
described elsewhere (44). To create 3⬘ UTR luciferase reporter
constructs, fragments (⬇500 bp) of 3⬘ UTRs of IRAK1, TRAF6,
and COT1 genes were cloned downstream of CMV-driven firefly
luciferase cassette in pMIR-REPORT vector (Ambion). Mutated
versions of these constructs, carrying 4-bp substitutions in the
miR-146 target sites, were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis.
For miRNA target validation studies, 105 293兾IL-1R兾TLR4兾MD2
cells in a 24-well dish were transiently transfected with 10 ng of each
firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, 10 ng of pCSK-lacZ vector, and
300 ng of cmv-146A, cmv-146B, or cmv-21.
