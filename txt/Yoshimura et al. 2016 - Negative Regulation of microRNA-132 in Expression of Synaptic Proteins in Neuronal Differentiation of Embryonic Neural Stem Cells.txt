MicroRNAs (miRs) play important roles in neuronal differentiation, maturation, and synaptic function in
the central nervous system. They have also been suggested to be implicated in the pathogenesis of
neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. Although miR-132 is one of the well-studied brain-speciﬁc
miRs, which regulates synaptic structure and function in the postnatal brain, its function in the prenatal
brain is still unclear. Here, we investigated miR-132 function during differentiation of rat embryonic
neural stem cells (eNSCs). We found that miR-132 expression signiﬁcantly increased during the fetal rat
brain development and neural differentiation of eNSCs in vitro. Furthermore, miR-132 expression was
increased during differentiation through MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation resulted
in increased levels of synaptic proteins including PSD-95, GluR1 and synapsin I. Silencing of miR-132 also
increased PSD-95 and GluR1. Considering that miR-132 increases synaptic proteins in differentiated
cortical neurons, our result shows a novel function of miR-132 as a negative regulator for synaptic
maturation in the neuronal differentiation of eNSCs.

1. Introduction
Neural stem cells (NSCs) have the ability of self-renewing and
differentiating into neurons and glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) in the developing and adult brain. MicroRNAs (miRs)
are small (~22 nt) non-coding RNAs that act as post-translational
regulators through target mRNA degradation and/or translational
repression by binding to the 3’ untranslated region of mRNAs
(Bartel, 2004). miRs are essential for developmental and physiological processes including cell apoptosis, differentiation and
metabolism in animals and plants (Carrington and Ambros, 2003).
The miRs studies in the developing brain and differentiating
cultured embryonic NSCs (eNSCs) have demonstrated that brainenriched miRs are important regulators for neuronal

differentiation (Krichevsky et al., 2003; Sempere et al., 2004; Miska
et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2010; Kawahara et al., 2012; Meza-Sosa
et al., 2014). Moreover miRs offer novel insights into brain-related
disease research. Recently, the crucial roles of miRs are increasingly reported in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases (Im and Kenny, 2012; Rao et al., 2013).
As a single microRNA can repress several targeting mRNAs,
multiple functions of a miR has been shown, depending not only on
cell types but also on spatial and temporal factors. For example, our
group recently reported that glial miR-134 enhanced by bFGF
positively regulated astroglial cell maturation (Numakawa et al.,
2015). On the other hand, it was demonstrated that miR-134 targets Chordin-like 1 (Chrdl-1) and Doublecortin (Dcx) in the
developing brain, and it has important roles in the stage-speciﬁc
modulation of eNSC proliferation, neuron migration and neuronal
differentiation via interacting with Chrdl-1 and Dcx (Gaughwin
et al., 2011).
In this study, to investigate further functions of miRs speciﬁcally
expressed during fetal neurodevelopment, we investigated miRs

expression during differentiation of rat eNSCs in vitro. Among
examined miRs, miR-132 showed the most dramatic increase during the differentiation into neuron from eNSCs. miR-132 is a wellstudied miR in the central nervous system (CNS). It functions in
neurotrophin signaling pathway including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and enhances neurite outgrowth (Wanet
et al., 2012). Interestingly, miR-132 has been implicated in
depression disorder (Li et al., 2013) in addition to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Wong et al., 2013)
and Parkinson's disease (PD) (Lungu et al., 2013). Methyl-CpGbinding protein 2 (MeCP2), a transcriptional repressor, was reported as a target of miR-132 (Klein et al., 2007). Mutation in
MeCP2 causes progressive neurological disorder Rett syndrome
(RTT) in female as a result of deﬁcits in synaptic maturation.
Whereas functions of miR-132 associated with postnatal CNS have
been well studied, its role in the prenatal brain still uncertain. Here
we examined the function and the induction mechanism of miR132 during neuronal differentiation of eNSCs in vitro. Our results
suggested that miR-132 negatively regulated the expression of
synaptic proteins in the neuronal maturation of eNSCs.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
All animals used in this study were Wistar rats, and were treated
according to the guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committee for the
care and use of animals in the National Institute of Neuroscience,
National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Japan. Brain samples
for the quantitative PCR were harvested from embryonic stage day
14.5 and 19.5 (E14.5 and E19.5) rats (CLEA JAPAN, Tokyo, Japan). The
tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen quickly and stored at 125  C
until RNA extraction.
2.2. Neural stem cell culture, differentiation, and transfection
eNSCs were obtained from telencephalon tissues of E14.5 rats
(Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan). Isolated eNSCs were maintained as
neurospheres in proliferation medium, KBM neural stem cell
(KOHJIN BIO, Saitama, Japan) with 0.2% KBM supplement containing EGF and bFGF (KOHJIN BIO), at 37  C in 5% CO2. After 4 days,
these neurospheres were dissociated by trypsin (SigmaeAldrich,
MO, USA), and cells were subsequently seeded onto tissue culture
dishes pre-coated with 0.2% polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Wako, Osaka,
Japan), with differentiation medium, KBM containing 2% B-27
serum-free supplement containing vitamin A (Life technologies,
CA, USA). Dissociated cells were plated at the density of
6  105 cells/35 mm culture dish (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA). For
immunocytochemistry, 9.375  104 cells/0.2 mL were re-seeded on
glass region of pre-coated glass-bottom dish (Matsunami, Osaka,
Japan). The culture medium was changed at 3 days in vitro (DIV3).
The differentiated eNSCs were treated with 10 mM U0126 (Millipore, MA, USA) at DIV3 to DIV7 to inhibit MAPK/ERK signaling
pathway. To activate TrkB signaling pathways, 100 ng/mL BDNF
(kindly gifted from Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., and Dainippon
Sumitomo Pharma Co. Ltd.) was applied to the cells at DIV4 and 6,
and 1 mg/mL TrkB-Fc chimeric protein (R&D Systems, MN, USA) was
added daily during DIV3-7 to block endogenous BDNF/TrkBmediated signalings. The eNSCs differentiation was observed using an inverted microscope (IX71, OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan) with a
microscope digital camera (DP21, OLYMPUS).
miRNA mimics (50 nM) (ID: MC10166, Life technologies), or
miRNA inhibitors (25 nM) (ID: MH10166, Life technologies) for
miR-132 or each negative controls (NC) (Life technologies) were
transfected into differentiating eNSCs at DIV3 using Lipofectamine

27

2000 or Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life technologies). After 6 h, the
transfection medium was replaced with fresh differentiation medium to reduce cellular toxicity of the reagent, and the transfected
cells were collected at DIV7.
2.3. Rat primary cortical culture
Primary cortical neurons were prepared from the cerebral cortex of postnatal 1e2 old (P1-2) rats (Japan SLC) as described previously (Numakawa et al., 2009). Primary neurons were maintained
in DMEM/F12 (Life technologies) containing 5% fetal bovine serum,
5% horse serum, and penicillin-streptomycin at 37  C in 5% CO2.
U0126 (10 mM) treatment in the neuronal cell cultures was performed at DIV3 to DIV7.
2.4. Immunocytochemistry
eNSCs undergoing differentiation were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The ﬁxed
cells were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution
containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (SigmaeAldrich) and 10% FBS in PBS,
overnight at 4  C. Triple staining was performed to estimate the
degree of differentiation to neuron. Anti-nestin monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Millipore) was used as neural stem cell marker. The
differentiation to neurons or glial cells was conﬁrmed by neuronal
marker, anti-MAP2 monoclonal antibody (1:500, SigmaeAldrich),
or astrocyte marker, anti-GFAP polyclonal antibody (1:1000,
Abcam, Cambridge, UK). After three times wash by PBS, the cells
were incubated with following secondary antibodies for 1 h at
room temperature: Alexa Fluor 647 mouse IgG2A (1:200, Life
technologies), Alexa Fluor 546 mouse IgG1 (1:2000, Life technologies) and Alexa Fluor 488 rabbit IgG (1:200, Life technologies).
Furthermore, to conﬁrm the developmental maturation of the
synapse during the cell differentiation, the cells at DIV7 were
incubated with anti-PSD-95 monoclonal (1:500, Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, CA, USA), anti-synapsin I monoclonal (1:500, Synaptic
Systems, Goettingen, Germany) and anti-bIII-tubulin (TUJ1) polyclonal (1:1000, SigmaeAldrich) antibodies followed by the incubation with secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 647 rabbit IgG
(1:200, Life technologies), Alexa Fluor 546 mouse IgG1 (1:2000, Life
technologies) and Alexa Fluor 488 mouse IgG2a (1:200, Life technologies). DAPI was also used to stain cell nuclei. The images were
obtained using a ﬂuorescence microscopy (Axiovert 200, Carl Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany).
2.5. Immunoblotting
For total protein extraction, cultured cells were lysed using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM TriseHCl pH
7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM Sodium Pyrophosphate, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM
PMSF and 2 mM Na3VO4). The cell lysates were heated at 100  C for
5 min and sonicated, then, the lysates were centrifuged and the
supernatants were collected. Protein concentration was measured
using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Life technologies).
Total proteins were separated in 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore). After
blocking in 5% skim milk, membranes were incubated with primary
mouse monoclonal antibodies for syntaxin (1:1000, SigmaeAldrich), TrkB (1:500, BD), TUJ1 (1:1000, Berkekey Antibody
Company, CA, USA), and b-actin (1:5000, SigmaeAldrich) or primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies for DCX (1:2000, Cell Signaling
Technology, MA, USA), GFAP (1:1000, Millipore), GluR1 (1:500,
Millipore), PSD-95 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), SOX1
(1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), SOX2 (1:1000, Abcam),

synapsin I (1:1000, Millipore), anti-phospho-MAPK/ERK (1:1000,
Cell Signaling Technology), anti-MAPK/ERK (1:1000, Cell Signaling
Technology) and GAPDH (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology).
Membranes were subsequently incubated with peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Jackson Immuno Research,
PA, USA) or rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:1000, Rockland, PA,
USA) for 1 h at room temperature. The relative intensities of bands
were quantiﬁed using Lane and Spot Analyzer soft ware (ATTO
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
2.6. RNA isolation and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)
Total RNAs including mRNAs and small RNAs from brain tissues
and cultured cells were extracted by mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit
(Ambion, TX, USA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) for miRNAs was
generated using TaqMan microRNA Reverse Transcription (RT) kit
(Applied Biosystems, MA, USA) and SuperScript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Life technologies) for mRNAs. The cDNA was subjected to
StepOnePlus Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with
TaqMan® MicroRNA Assays or TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays;
miR-9 (ID: 000583, Life technologies), miR-124a (ID: 001182), miR132 (ID: 000457), miR-134 (ID: 001186), miR-206 (ID: 000510), and
BDNF mRNA (ID: Rn02531976). The relative expression levels of
RNAs were calculated by the DDCt method. MicroRNAs and BDNF
mRNA levels were normalized to miR-16 (ID: 000391) and GAPDH
(ID: 4352338E) levels, respectively.
2.7. Statistical analysis
The statistical differences were compared by the Student's t-test
or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post-hoc test in SPSS (SPSS
Japan, Tokyo, Japan). A P-value of <0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. The expression of miRs in the developing fetal brain
To investigate changes in miRs expression levels, we analyzed
ﬁve miRs (miR-9, -124a, -132, -134 and -206) in the developing fetal
brains by real-time qPCR. These miRs are suggested to be involved
in psychiatric and/or neurological disorders (Mouillet-Richard
et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2012; Rao et al., 2013). Total RNAs were
isolated from the rat telencephalon (TE) at E14.5, cerebral cortex
(CTX) and hippocampus (HIP) at E19.5. BDNF mRNA expression
levels was increased, especially in HIP, with the growth of the fetal
brain (P < 0.01) (Sup. Fig. 1A). miR-132 levels in CTX and HIP at
E19.5 showed dramatic increase (nearly twentyfold) compared
with TE at E14.5 (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1).
3.2. eNSC in vitro and differentiation to neurons
To investigate the mechanisms underlying the miRs expression
changes observed in the fetal brain, we established an in vitro
model for eNSCs differentiation. eNSCs obtained from E14.5 rat TE
formed neurospheres in the presence of EGF and bFGF. Dissociated
neurospheres were re-seeded and differentiated in EGF- and bFGFfree medium. After 7-days differentiation, the eNSCs developed
neuronal morphology with long and branched neurites (Fig. 2A).
The differentiated eNSCs showed decreased expression of nestin, a
neural stem cell marker, and most cells differentiated into neuron
(MAP2 only, 77.23%) while little population became astrocyte
(GFAP only, 1.98%) (Fig. 2B and D). Synapses were observed by
immunostaining with post- (PSD-95) and presynaptic (synapsin I)
markers at DIV7 (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis conﬁrmed
decreasing expression of neural stem cell markers SOX1 and SOX2,

and upregulation of neuron speciﬁc proteins DCX and TUJ1, presynaptic proteins (synapsin I and syntaxin), and postsynaptic proteins (GluR1 and PSD-95) during in vitro differentiation (Fig. 2E).
3.3. Increased miR-132 expression required activation of MAPK/ERK
pathway
Using in vitro differentiation model for eNSCs, we examined the
expression of ﬁve miRs (miR-9, -124a, -132, -134 and -206) by realtime qPCR. While miR-9 (data not shown) and miR-134 levels
showed no signiﬁcant changes during the differentiation, ~30-fold
elevated expression level of miR-132 was conﬁrmed (P < 0.001)
(Fig. 2F). Both miR-124 and miR-206, showed a tendency to increase the expression at DIV4 and DIV3 to DIV7, respectively (data
not shown).
We previously reported that exogenous BDNF stimulated miR132 expression via MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway and subsequently
upregulated synaptic proteins in cultured cortical neurons
(Kawashima et al., 2010; Numakawa et al., 2011). To determine
whether BDNF and MAPK/ERK pathway were involved in the
upregulation of miR-132 and synaptic proteins in differentiating
eNSCs, the relationships among BDNF, ERK1/2, and miR-132 were
investigated. Interestingly, BDNF mRNA showed a similar expression pattern to miR-132 (Sup. Fig. 1B). BDNF receptor TrkB, leading
to the activation of MAPK/ERK signaling, was increased from DIV4
to 7 (Sup. Fig. 1C). ERK1/2 activity was transiently reduced at DIV3
and increased again after DIV4 (Fig. 3A). When spontaneous ERK1/2
activity was suppressed by 10 mM U0126 (an inhibitor of MAPK/ERK
kinase) during DIV3-7 (Fig. 3B), miR-132 expression was dramatically reduced at DIV7 (Fig. 3C) and synaptic proteins including PSD95 (P < 0.05), GluR1 (P < 0.05) and synapsin I (P < 0.01) were
signiﬁcantly increased (Fig. 3D). Immunostaining analysis with
synaptic markers (PSD-95 and synapsin I), however, did not show a
signiﬁcant difference in the number of synaptic sites after U0126
treatment because of the variation in the number of synaptic
puncta among neurites even in the same neuron (Fig. 3E). On the
other hand, primary cortical neurons (already differentiated) did
not show any miR-132 increase during neuronal maturation
without exogenous BDNF (Sup. Fig. 2A), despite upregulation in
ERK1/2 activation and synaptic proteins (PSD-95, synapsin I, and
syntaxin) after DIV5 (Sup. Fig. 2B and C). In contrast to eNSCs,
U0126 slightly reduced synaptic proteins such as PSD-95
(P < 0.001) and synapsin I (P < 0.05) in cultured cortical neuron
(Sup. Fig. 2D, E and F). To examine whether the elevation of miR132 during the eNSCs differentiation was regulated through
MAPK/ERK1/2 activation by “endogenous” BDNF, a BDNF scavenger
TrkB-Fc chimeric protein was used. Although TrkB-Fc treatment
from DIV3 to 7 reduced ERK1/2 activation (Sup. Fig. 3A), it had no
effect on the expression of miR-132 (Sup. Fig. 3B). Exogenous BDNF
application also did not have a signiﬁcant effect on the miR-132
expression although it signiﬁcantly induced ERK1/2 activation
(Sup. Fig. 3C and D). These results suggested different regulatory
systems for miR-132 expression in differentiating and differentiated neurons, and indicated that miR-132 in eNSCs negatively
regulated synaptic proteins expression.
3.4. Downregulation of synaptic proteins by miR-132 during
differentiation of eNSCs
We next determined miR-132 function in synaptic maturation of
eNSCs. Transfection of miR-132 mimic at DIV3 decreased expression levels of synaptic proteins compared with negative controls, by
13e20% in presynaptic proteins, synapsin I (P < 0.05) and syntaxin
(P < 0.01), and 22e28% in postsynaptic proteins, PSD-95 (P < 0.05)
and GluR1 (P < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). Cytoskeleton-associated proteins

(TUJ1 and b-actin) also showed a decreased expression while
GAPDH, a house keeping gene, was unchanged. Conversely, miR132 inhibitor upregulated postsynaptic proteins PSD-95 and
GluR1 (P < 0.05) while it did not change levels of presynaptic
proteins including synapsin I, syntaxin, SNAP25, and synaptotagmin (Fig. 4B and C, and data not shown). These results supported
that miR-132 played a suppressive role in synaptic maturation of
eNSCs.
4. Discussion
Previous studies have reported positive effects of miR-132 on
neuronal functions including synaptic plasticity, dendrite
outgrowth, and cell survival (Edbauer et al., 2010; Magill et al.,
2010; Luikart et al., 2011; Wanet et al., 2012; Remenyi et al.,
2013; Hwang et al., 2014). Down-regulation of miR-132 has also
been implicated in several neurological disorders such as AD (Wong
et al., 2013), PD (Lungu et al., 2013), schizophrenia (Miller et al.,
2012) and depression (Li et al., 2013). Most of the studies, however, focused on the miR-132 functions in differentiated neurons.
Here we found a novel function of miR-132 during neuronal differentiation of eNSCs to negatively regulate expression of synaptic
proteins. We also showed that miR-132 signiﬁcantly increased
during both prenatal brain development and differentiation of
eNSCs into neurons while it showed little change during maturation of cultured cortical neurons. Furthermore, ERK1/2 activation
during DIV3-7 suppressed the upregulation of synaptic proteins in
eNSCs via elevating miR-132 expression.
Because miR-132 expression was increased through MAPK/
ERK1/2 signaling pathway activated by exogenous BDNF in differentiated cortical neurons (Kawashima et al., 2010; Numakawa et al.,
2011) and BDNF mRNA and TrkB were elevated in parallel with the
miR-132 increase during the neuronal differentiation observed in
this study, we had expected that miR-132 was also upregulated in
eNSCs by endogenous BDNF via ERK1/2 activation. Although miR132 expression was almost completely dependent on ERK1/2 activity during DIV4-7, both activating and inhibiting of endogenous

BDNF/TrkB signaling by exogenous application of BDNF and TrkBFc, respectively, did not cause a signiﬁcant effect on miR-132
expression. Considering that miR-132 was reported to be induced
by neuronal activity (Wayman et al., 2008) and ERK1/2 activity in
eNSCs was also partially suppressed by TrkB-Fc, the ERK signalingdependent miR-132 expression in eNSCs would be regulated by
other activity-dependent factors than BDNF/TrkB signaling, or the
other signaling pathways which repress the miR-132 expression
might be stimulated simultaneously after TrkB activation.
MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway is one of the key regulators of neuronal
differentiation and neurite outgrowth in the developing CNS (Li
et al., 2006). In the in vitro neuronal differentiation model used
here, an intriguing activation pattern of ERK1/2 was observed.
Strong ERK1/2 activation immediate after plating the dissociated
neurospheres was transiently reduced at DIV3 and the activity was
recovered during DIV4-7. It was reported that miR-34, a repressor
for neuronal differentiation of eNSC, was increased after several
hours of differentiation induction, and decreased at DIV1, then,
remained low expression levels throughout neuronal differentiation and maturation until DIV12 (Morgado et al., 2014). Furthermore, blockade of ERK1/2 signaling immediate after the induction
of differentiation lead to reduce the number of NeuN-positive cells
and expression of presynaptic protein synaptophysin (Li et al.,
2006). Based upon these results, the ﬁrst ERK1/2 activation might
be required for the initiation of the eNSCs differentiation and the
second activation (after DIV4) would be responsible for further
enhancement of neuronal differentiation and/or maturation.
Reduced ERK1/2 activation with U0126 during DIV3-7 promoted
the expression of synaptic proteins (PSD-95, GluR1 and synapsin I)
in eNSCs. Similar results were obtained in the silencing of miR-132,
in which postsynaptic proteins (PSD-95 and GluR1) were increased,
suggesting a negative regulation of ERK1/2 on these synaptic protein expression via inducing miR-132 expression. Interestingly,
miR-132 inhibitor treatment increased only postsynaptic proteins
without affecting presynaptic proteins. Our previous study reported that antisense for miR-132 changed the levels of postsynaptic proteins (NR2A, NR2B and GluR1) but not presynaptic

Fig. 3. Activity of MAPK/ERK signaling pathway induced miR-132 and suppressed synaptic proteins expression. U0126 (10 mM), a MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor, was administered
during neuronal differentiation of eNSCs. (A) Western blotting of phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) in differentiating eNSCs. (B) U0126 almost completely diminished
phospho-ERK1/2 levels in eNSCs (n ¼ 5). (C) Quantitative PCR measurement of miR-132 in differentiating eNSCs in the presence or absence of U0126 (n ¼ 4). Relative expression of
miR-132 is normalized to miR-16. (D) Increased levels of PSD-95, GluR1 and synapsin I after the U0126 treatment were observed. Data are obtained from two independent cultures
(n ¼ 5). Error bars present SD. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 versus control (t-test). (E) The cells after U0126 treatment were immunostained with antibodies against PSD-95

proteins (SNAP25 and synapsin I) in differentiated cortical neurons
(Kawashima et al., 2010). These results suggested that miR-132
tends to play a regulatory role in postsynaptic proteins in neural
cells. It is possible that miR-132 regulates indirectly expression
levels of these synaptic proteins because they have not been listed
as the targets of miR-132 in miRs’ target databases. There is a report
about a miR-132-dependent negative regulation for differentiation
of dopaminergic neurons developed from embryonic stem cells,
where miR-132 was endogenously increased after DIV6 of differentiation (Yang et al., 2012). As mentioned above, our previous
study demonstrated a miR-132-dependent positive regulation in
the expression of synaptic proteins in differentiated cortical neurons (Kawashima et al., 2010). Although the exact reason why miR132 regulations for synaptic proteins in eNSCs and differentiated
neurons were different has remained unclear, the main target of
miR-132 might be changed, depending on the developmental
stages of neural cells.
The miR-132 overexpression in this study caused a reduced level
of b-actin as well as synaptic proteins. b-actin, a cytoskeletal protein, is essential for dendritic spine structure and its synthesis in

dendrites is stimulated by local synaptic activity (Buxbaum et al.,
2014). The inhibitor for miR-132 had little inﬂuence on the
expression of b-actin compared to its reduction induced by miR132 overexpression, suggesting that an excess amount of b-actin
would be expressed in eNSCs and b-actin levels was reduced only
when miR-132 was overexpressed. PSD-95, which was also sensitive to miR-132, is a member of postsynaptic scaffolding proteins
and associates with glutamate receptors (AMPA and NMDA receptors) and cytoskeletal proteins, supporting postsynaptic structure (Chen et al., 2011). Moreover, PSD-95 plays a role to regulate
for surface expression of glutamate receptors at postsynaptic sites
(Ehrlich and Malinow, 2004). Using immature neurons, it was reported that excess expression of PSD-95 caused aberrant spine
formation (Mizui et al., 2005). These results indicate that miR-132
might have a modulating role in appropriate postsynaptic formation during neuronal differentiation of eNSCs.
Recent studies have revealed the important relationship between miRs and brain-related diseases. Zucchi and colleagues reported that prenatal stress modulated an epigenetic regulation of
expression of miRs associated with psychiatric/neurological

disorders in the offspring (Zucchi et al., 2013). Moreover, miRs
levels in the prenatal brain would also be affected by maternallymediated exposure to drug and alcohol (Ignacio et al., 2014). Our
previous study showed a stress-related hormone (glucocorticoid)induced reduction in BDNF-stimulated miR-132 expression in
cortical neurons (Kawashima et al., 2010). These ﬁndings indicate
the importance of miR functions for normal synapse formation in
the developing brain and of the future research focusing on miR
functions in stress-related brain disorders.
