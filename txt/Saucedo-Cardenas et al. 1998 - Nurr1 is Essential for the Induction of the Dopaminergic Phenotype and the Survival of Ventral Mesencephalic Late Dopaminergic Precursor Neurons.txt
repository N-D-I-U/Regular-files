underlying their development are poorly understood and are
the subject of intense investigation. The development of
mid-brain dopaminergic neurons is initiated at embryonic day
10 in the mouse in the ventrolateral neural tube adjacent to the
floor plate and is regulated by the floor plate-derived morphogenic signal, sonic hedgehog (SHH) (8–11). SHH initially
induces a general ventral cell fate characterized by the induction of ventral markers, including the SHH receptor, ptc, the
winged helix, and zinc finger transcription factors, HNF3b and
Gli-1 (11–14). Subsequently, these ventralized cells further
differentiate to adopt different specific cell fates along the
anterior–posterior axis. Indeed, ectopic expression of SHH in
the dorsal neural tube of transgenic mice is sufficient to drive
induction of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons of the
mid- and hindbrain, respectively (11). At the level of the
midbrain, this differentiation leads ultimately to the expression
of dopamine synthetic enzymes including tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) and L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). The
expression of these enzymes in the ventral midbrain at embryonic day 11.5 in the mouse is characteristic of the emergence of a dopaminergic phenotype (15).
Nurr1, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of
transcription factors (16–18), is expressed predominantly in
the central nervous system in limbic areas and the ventral
midbrain, including dopamine neurons (19–21). The onset of
Nurr1 expression in the ventral midbrain occurs at embryonic
day 10.5 before the appearance of the dopaminergic marker
enzyme, TH, at embryonic day 11.5. Expression of Nurr1
continues in mature dopaminergic neurons during adulthood,
suggesting that the protein may also be required for normal
function of mature dopaminergic neurons. Using Nurr1 null
mutant mice, Zetterstrom et al. (19) recently demonstrated
that ablation of Nurr1 leads to agenesis of midbrain dopaminergic neurons as evidenced by an absence of the dopaminergic
cell markers, TH, the retinoic acid converting enzyme, ADH2
and the receptor tyrosine kinase, c-ret, and a loss of striatal
dopamine neurotransmitter. However, the precise role of
nurr1 in this developmental cascade has not been established.
The objective of this study was to examine the role of Nurr1
in mediating the final differentiation of ventral dopaminergic
neurons. Here we demonstrate that in the absence of Nurr1,
neuroepithelial cells undergo normal ventralization, differentiate into neurons, and adopt a specific mesencephalic phenotype that is identified by the expression of the homeodomain
protein, Ptx-3 (22). However, these dopamine precursor cells
are arrested in a developmental state described by a lack of
dopamine phenotypic markers. Further, these dopaminergic
precursors do not survive and die as development progresses
to the neonatal stage. Together, these data indicate that Nurr1

ABSTRACT
Nurr1 is a member of the nuclear receptor
superfamily of transcription factors that is expressed predominantly in the central nervous system, including developing and mature dopaminergic neurons. Recent studies have
demonstrated that Nurr1 is essential for the induction of
phenotypic markers of ventral mid-brain dopaminergic neurons whose generation is specified by the f loor plate-derived
morphogenic signal sonic hedgehog (SHH), but the precise
role of Nurr1 in this differentiative pathway has not been
established. To provide further insights into the role of Nurr1
in the final differentiation pathway, we have examined the fate
of dopamine cell precursors in Nurr1 null mutant mice. Here
we demonstrate that Nurr1 functions at the later stages of
dopamine cell development to drive differentiation of ventral
mesencephalic late dopaminergic precursor neurons. In the
absence of Nurr1, neuroepithelial cells that give rise to
dopaminergic neurons adopt a normal ventral localization
and neuronal phenotype characterized by expression of the
homeodomain transcription factor and mesencephalic
marker, Ptx-3, at embryonic day 11.5. However, these late
precursors fail to induce a dopaminergic phenotype, indicating that Nurr1 is essential for specifying commitment of
mesencephalic precursors to the full dopaminergic phenotype.
Further, as development progresses, these mid-brain dopamine precursor cells degenerate in the absence of Nurr1,
resulting in loss of Ptx-3 expression and a concomitant
increase in apoptosis of ventral midbrain neurons in newborn
null mutant mice. Taken together, these data indicate that
Nurr1 is essential for both survival and final differentiation
of ventral mesencephalic late dopaminergic precursor neurons into a complete dopaminergic phenotype.
The catecholamine neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central
role in the control of voluntary movement, cognition, and
emotive behaviors (1). The majority of neurons that produce
dopamine originate in the ventral midbrain in the substantia
nigra (A9) and the ventral tegmental area (A10). Neurons
arising from the substantia nigra project to the striatum to
regulate motor control and their degeneration is associated
with Parkinson’s disease (1–3). Neurons from the ventral
tegmental area give rise to a distinct system that projects to the
limbic system and cortex, and regulates emotional and reward
behavior and motivation (4). Disturbances in this system are
implicated in schizophrenia and addictive behavioral disorders
(5–7).
While the physiological relevance and clinical significance of
dopaminergic neurons are well recognized, the mechanisms

regulates dopaminergic cell development by promoting both
survival of ventral mesencephalic neurons and their differentiation into the final dopaminergic phenotype.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Gene Targeting. The Nurr1 genomic DNA fragment ('7.6
kb) that comprised the gene targeting vector was isolated from
mouse 129Sv l Dash II genomic library (Stratagene) using as
a probe a fragment from the N-terminal region of Nurr1 cDNA
(16, 23). This mNurr1 genomic fragment contained exons 2–8
of the Nurr1 gene. Exon 3 encodes the nonconserved Nterminal domain of the receptor that contains the initiating
methionine residue, ATG. The neor gene PGKNEObpA (24)
was inserted into a unique NcoI restriction site in exon 3 that
was located downstream from the initiator codon ATG but
upstream of the DNA-binding domain in the Nurr1 gene (16).
The insertion of the neor gene into exon 3 divides the 7.6-kb
Nurr1 genomic fragment into 59 and 39 arms of Nurr1 homology that are 1.9 kb and 5.7 kb in size, respectively. The herpes
simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene (25) was
attached 59 to exon 3 and inserted with a transcriptional
orientation opposite to both the neo and Nurr1 genes. The
cloning plasmid used in this vector construction was PSP72
(Promega). The targeting vector was linearized by the restriction enzyme NotI located in a synthetic linker at the 39 end of
the long arm of homology.
Introduction of Targeting Vector into Mouse Embryonic
Stem (ES) Cells. The general procedures for culturing and
manipulating ES cells before and after the electroporation step
were followed as described (26). Briefly, 107 ES cells were
electroporated with 25 mg of linearized targeting vector in 0.9
ml of PBS at 230 V and 500 mF with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser.
Electroporations were performed routinely using the actively
growing ES cell line AB-1 (27). ES cells were cultured in the
presence of G418 (350 mgyml) and 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-b-Darabinofurnaosyl)-5-iodouracil (FIAU) drug selection. Drugresistant ES cell colonies were picked and expanded in 96-well
SNL76y7 feeder plates (master plates). A duplicate gelatinized
96 well (no feeder layer) of each master plate was also
prepared to identify targeted events by Southern blot analysis.
The master plates containing the ES cell clones for blastocyst
microinjection were frozen at 270°C until identification of
those ES cells scoring positive for the targeted event.
Generation of Chimeric Mice and Germ-Line Transmission
of the Nurr1 Mutation. Four targeted ES cell clones were
tested for germ-line transmission of the Nurr1 mutation. ES
cells (13–15) were microinjected into the blastocoel of 3.5day-old blastocyst stage embryos derived from C57BLy6 females. Embryos were transferred unilaterally into the uterine
horn (six to seven embryos per horn) of pseudopregnant F1
(CBA 3 C57BLy6) foster mothers. Approximately 10 days
after birth, the sex of the offspring was determined and the
extent of agouti coat color was evaluated. Male chimeras with
60% to 100% agouti coat color were backcrossed to C57BLy6
females, and germ-line transmission was determined by the
presence of agouti offspring.
Screening of ES Cells and Mouse Tail DNA for Targeted
Events. To identify the Nurr1 mutation in ES cells, Southern
blot analysis was performed on genomic DNA isolated from
ES cells colonies. DNA samples were digested with BamHI
overnight, resolved by electrophoresis, and transferred onto
nylon membranes for hybridization with a radiolabeled 0.9-kb
HindIII–EcoRV genomic DNA fragment located outside but
immediately 59 to the disrupted nurr1 genomic fragment (see
Fig. 1 A). Hybridization and washing conditions were as described (28). To detect germ-line transmission of the null
mutant allele, PCR analysis of tail DNA from agouti offspring
from chimeric mice was carried out. Three oligonucleotides
were used in a single PCR for genotyping. They consisted of

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 (1998)
a 59 primer (GGCACTCCTGTGTCTAGCTGCC) located on
the 59-end of the neor gene in exon 3 and two 39 primers, one
(CTGCCTTGGGAAAAGCGCCTCC) located in the neor
gene to generate a 200-bp PCR product representing the
mutated allele and the other (CAGCCCTCACAAGTGCGAACAC) located in a 39 portion of exon 3 that was deleted
in the targeting vector to allow selective detection of the
wild-type allele as a 300-bp product.
Determination of TH Activity, Catecholamine, and Related
Compounds. TH was measured using coupled nonenzymatic
decarboxylation of L-dopa (29). Briefly, mouse striatal tissues
after dissection were homogenized in 50 mM of cold TriszHCl
buffer containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.2
(1:20 volyvol) with a Teflon homogenizer. Twenty-five microliter aliquots of homogenate were incubated in a microwell
culture plate with reaction solution containing [14C]tyrosine
[NEN, specific activity 48.6 mCiymmol (1 Ci 5 37 GBq)] and
cofactors at 37°C for 20 min. The L-[14C]dopa formed was
decarboxylated by adding 33 mM potassium ferricyianide and
heating the mixture at 55°C for 30 min. The [14C]CO2 released
was absorbed on filter paper impregnated with benzethonium
hydroxide and quantified by counting the radioactivity on the
paper covering each well.
Catecholamines and related compounds in homogenized
tissue were extracted with 10% perchloric acid (1:10 volyvol),
clarified by centrifugation, and chromatographed by HPLC on
a BAS PyN reversed-phase cartridge column (Phase-II ODS 3
mm 3 100 3 3.2 mm). The acid extract was applied isocratically
and detected electrochemically according to published procedures (30).
Measurement of Choline Acetyltransferase (Chat) Activity.
Chat activity was assayed in the caudate nucleus, hippocampus,
and frontal cortex, using a slight modification of Fonnum’s
method (31). After brain tissues were homogenized in 10 mM
(1:50 volyvol) of cold PBS containing 1 mM of EDTA (pH 7.4),
and centrifuged at 10,000 3 g for 10 min, 25 ml of supernatant
was incubated with 75 ml of assay medium (150 mM NaCly0.5
mM EDTAy0.15 mM eseriney0.2 mM [3H]acetyl-CoAy5 mM
choline chloridey50 mM PBS) in 96-well plate microwells.
After 45 min incubation at 37°C, reactions were terminated by
transferring 80 ml of incubation mixtures into vials containing
Fonnum’s scintillation solution, and were counted in the
Rockbeta LKB scintillation counter.
Immunohistochemistry and in Situ Hybridization. For immunohistochemical studies, brains of wild-type and mutant
newborns were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12–24 hours
at 4°C and soaked in 30% sucrose overnight, frozen, and cut
on a cryostat to 20 mm. Frozen sections were stained according
to standard avidin–biotin immunohistochemical procedures
(Vector Laboratories). Primary antisera included polyclonal
rabbit antiserum against TH and AADC diluted 1:600 (Eugene Tech International, Inc.) and mouse monoclonal antiserum 3A10 diluted 1:200 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma
Bank). In situ hybridization with TH, Ptx-3, HNF3b, and Nurr1
riboprobes were performed as described previously (20, 22).
Apoptosis Detection. Embryos were obtained by dissection
of pregnant mice at specific stages of pregnancy [noon of the
day on which the copulatory plug was detected was designated
day 0.5 of gestation (E0.5)]. The embryos and newborn brains
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated by washing in
graded alcohol solutions, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned
at 5 mm. To identify apoptotic cells, we used the trevigen
apoptotic cell system in situ kit (TACS) from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD) according to manufacturer’s recommendations.

fragment of the mouse nurr1 gene interrupted within exon 3 by
the introduction of a neomycin resistance cassette (neor)
downstream of the initiator ATG and upstream of the DNAbinding domain of nurr1. Targeted integration of this vector
into the nurr1 genomic locus was detected by Southern blot
analysis of BamHI-digested ES cell DNA using a 32P-labeled
genomic probe (900 bp) located 59 to the nurr1 sequences used
in the targeting vector (Fig. 1 A). Using this strategy, the
wild-type nurr1 gene is represented by a 5.5-kb radioactive
band containing exons 2–4, whereas the mutated nurr1 allele
is represented by a shorter hybridizing band at 3.5-kb due to
the presence of an additional BamHI site within the neor gene
(Fig. 1B). Targeted ES cell clones were microinjected into
blastocysts to generate chimeric mice and germ-line transmission of the mutant allele was detected by PCR analysis of tail
DNA from agouti offspring of chimeras derived from one ES
cell clone. In these analyses (see Materials and Methods), the
wild-type nurr1 gene is represented by a 300-bp PCR product
while the mutated allele is represented by a 200-bp PCR
product (Fig. 1C). Genotype analysis indicated that homozygote Nurr1 null mutant (Nurr12y2) mice were born at the
expected frequency but consistent with previous findings these
mice died within 12 hours after birth (19).
Ventral Midbrain Dopaminergic Neurons Specifically Require Nurr1 for Final Differentiation. To examine the role of
nurr1 in development of the dopaminergic system, we analyzed
the expression of two dopaminergic cell markers, TH and
AADC, in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area of
wild-type and nurr12y2 neonatal mice by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2 A–D). Consistent with previous findings, ablation
of nurr1 resulted in a complete absence of both markers,
confirming that nurr1 is essential for expression of a mesen-

cephalic dopaminergic cell phenotype. Analysis of striatal
neurotransmission confirmed that this defect is associated with
a significant decrease in TH activity at the striatal axon
terminals (Fig. 2F), a complete loss of dopamine from the
striatum of Nurr12y2 mice and a significant decrease in
dopamine levels in heterozygote mice (Fig. 2E). Furthermore,
analysis of the levels of catecholamines, serotonin, and cholinergic activity demonstrated that the defect in striatal neurotransmission was specific to dopamine because levels of
norepinephrine, serotonin, and Chat were uneffected (Fig. 2 E
and G). Finally, to determine whether the defect was specific
to the mesencephalic dopamine neurons, we examined TH
expression and dopamine levels in neural crest-derived cells of
the adrenal medulla that also express Nurr1 (Fig. 3A). Comparison of TH immunoreactivity (Fig. 3 C and D) and dopamine transmitter levels (Fig. 3B) in wild-type and Nurr12y2
mice revealed no abnormalities associated with Nurr1 ablation, indicating that Nurr1 is not required for development of
these cells. Similarly, no changes in TH expression were
observed in dopaminergic neurons of the periglomerular
region of the olfactory bulb in nurr1 null mutant mice (Fig. 3
E and F) even though these neurons normally express nurr1
(21).
Nurr1 Is Essential for Terminal Differentiation of Late
Mesencephalic Precursor Neurons into a Full Dopaminergic
Phenotype. To examine the stage in mesencephalic dopaminergic cell development at which Nurr1 functions, we examined the phenotype of cells in the ventral midbrain of wild-type
and Nurr1 null mutant embryos at embryonic day 11.5 using
specific markers of the dopaminergic developmental cascade.
First, we determined whether the cells have responded to the
SSH inductive signal by adopting a general neuronal phenotype. Comparison of the expression of the ventral marker,
HNF3b, and the general neuronal marker, 3A10 (32), in
wild-type and Nurr12y2 mice showed similar expression of
both markers in wild-type and Nurr12y2 mice demonstrating
that ventralization and general neuronal induction of neuroepithelial cells in the ventrolateral neural plate are uneffected
by Nurr1 ablation (Fig. 4 A and B). Next, we examined the

that appeared to be in all cells of the ventral midbrain,

indicating that Ptx-3 expression is independent of Nurr1 (Fig.
4C). Finally, analysis of the expression of TH shows that
differentiation to the dopaminergic phenotype fails to occur at
E11.5 in Nurr12y2 mice (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data
indicate that Nurr1 functions at the later stages of dopamine
cell development to drive differentiation of Ptx-3 positive
ventral mesencephalic neurons to the final dopaminergic phenotype.
Nurr1 Is Essential for Survival of Late Dopaminergic
Precursor Neurons. To determine whether mesencephalic
dopaminergic precursors survive in the absence of Nurr1, we
examined the persistence of Ptx-3 positive neurons to the
neonatal stage (Fig. 5A). Analysis of the expression of this
marker in neonatal mice demonstrated continued strong expression of Ptx-3 in mature dopaminergic neurons of wild-type
mice. In contrast, however, Nurr12y2 mice showed few scattered cells expressing Ptx-3 in the ventral mid-brain, indicating
significant loss of Ptx-3 positive cells in the neonate (Fig. 5 C
and D). Furthermore, the loss of Ptx-3 expression was specific
to the mid-brain region and was not observed in other Ptx-3
expressing areas (data not shown). Thus, while Nurr1 is not
involved in induction of Ptx-3 expression, it is critically involved
in maintenance of Ptx-3 expressing cells. To determine
whether the loss in PTX-3 expression was associated with a loss
of ventral midbrain cells, we compared the levels of apoptosis
in wild-type and Nurr12y2 mutant neonates using a TUNEL
assay. The results of these analyses demonstrated that the loss
in Ptx-3-expressing cells was associated with an increase in the
number of apoptotic and dying cells that was specific to the
ventral midbrain of the Nurr1 null mutant mice (Fig. 5 E and
F). Quantitation of apoptotic cells in the substantia nigra and
VTA regions in three independent wild-type and Nurr1 null
mutant neonates confirmed an increase in apoptotic cells from
0.5% in wild-type mice to 7% in Nurr1 null mutant mice.
Finally, the increase in cell death was consistent with an
obvious decrease in the number of cells observed in the
neonatal ventral midbrain (see Fig. 5 C and E versus D and F).
These data indicate that Nurr1 is required for survival of

mesencephalic dopaminergic precursor cells as well as their
terminal differentiation into dopamine producing cells.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have demonstrated that the role of Nurr1 in
dopaminergic cell development is specific to the ventral midbrain where it is essential to induce final differentiation of
ventral mesencephalic dopaminergic precursor neurons into a
dopaminergic phenotype as well as for survival of these late
dopaminergic precursors.
The expression of Ptx-3 in developing dopaminergic cells
coincident with the onset of expression of a fully differentiated
dopaminergic phenotype provides an excellent marker for late
dopamine progenitor cells in the mid-brain (22). Ptx-3 is a
novel bicoid-related homeobox gene product that is strongly
expressed in dopaminergic cells of the ventral midbrain at the
time of their differentiation, suggesting that the protein may be
involved in determination of the mesencephalic dopaminergic
lineage (22). Expression of Ptx-3 and nurr1 persists in midbrain
dopaminergic neurons of the adult, indicating that both proteins may be involved in maintenance of dopamine cell function in the adult brain. The strong expression of Ptx-3 in the
ventral mid-brain of Nurr12y2 embryos indicates that induction of expression of this protein and the development of late
dopamine precursor neurons are independent of Nurr1. In
contrast, Nurr1 is essential for induction of a dopaminergic
phenotype in Ptx-3 positive precursor neurons. In this regard,
it is possible that Ptx-3 and Nurr1, although regulated independently, may function in a cooperative manner to regulate
factors required for terminal differentiation of dopaminergic
neurons. Consistent with this hypothesis, cooperative interactions between a nuclear orphan receptor (FTZ-F1) and a
homeodomain protein (FTZ) have been demonstrated recently (33, 34). In the case of Nurr1, such cooperative interactions may explain the specificity of the neuronal defects in
midbrain dopaminergic neurons because Ptx-3 is not expressed
in other Nurr1-containing neurons, including the limbic system
and dopaminergic neurons of the olfactory bulb and hypothalamus (20, 21).
The observation that Nurr1 is essential for maintenance of
Ptx-3 positive progenitors raises speculation as to the role of
Nurr1 in dopaminergic cell survival. Increased cell death in
Nurr12y2 neonates may simply be due an inability of undifferentiated dopamine progenitors to make synaptic contacts
with their targets. Previous studies using mutant mice in which
TH was ablated in dopaminergic neurons have indicated that
dopamine-mediated signaling does not appear to be required
for functional synaptogenesis of neuronal projections from the
substantia nigra to the striatum (35). However, it cannot be
ruled out that loss of all markers of the dopaminergic phenotype as is observed in the Nurr1 null mutant mice has an impact
on the establishment of such connections. A second possibility
is that Nurr1 may be required for the expression of factors that
promote survival as well as differentiation of dopamine progenitors. Dopaminergic cell survival is known to be regulated
by the neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) and neurotrophin 4y5 (36–38) and by members of the
TGFb family of trophic factors, most notably glial-derived
neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (39, 40). The trophic effects of
these factors on dopamine cell survival are apparently redundant because ablation of individual members of these families
or their receptors does not result in dopamine cell loss (41–43).
However, the role of these factors in promoting survival and
differentiation of late dopamine precursor neurons is unknown. A role for nurr1 in regulation of survival of both
dopamine precursors and differentiated dopaminergic cells at
least in part through regulation of these factors andyor their
receptors is supported by the observation that ablation of
Nurr1 results in loss of expression of the tyrosine kinase signal

transducing receptor for GDNF, c-ret (19) and by the identification of binding sites for Nurr1 in the promoter region of the
BDNF gene (44). Thus, it is possible that Nurr1 may be a
transcriptional regulator of several of these genes. Further
studies to examine the role of Nurr1 in the regulation of
neurotrophic factors and their receptors should provide important insights into the role of Nurr1 in dopaminergic cell
commitment and survival.
