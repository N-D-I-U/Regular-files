SUMMARY

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that
suppress translation of specific mRNAs. The miRNA
machinery interacts with fragile X mental retardation
protein (FMRP), which functions as translational
repressor. We show that miR-125b and miR-132, as
well as several other miRNAs, are associated with
FMRP in mouse brain. miR-125b and miR-132 had
largely opposing effects on dendritic spine morphology and synaptic physiology in hippocampal
neurons. FMRP knockdown ameliorates the effect
of miRNA overexpression on spine morphology. We
identified NMDA receptor subunit NR2A as a target
of miR-125b and show that NR2A mRNA is specifically associated with FMRP in brain. In hippocampal
neurons, NR2A expression is negatively regulated
through its 30 UTR by FMRP, miR-125b, and Argonaute 1. Regulation of NR2A 30 UTR by FMRP
depends in part on miR-125b. Because NMDA
receptor subunit composition profoundly affects
synaptic plasticity, these observations have implications for the pathophysiology of fragile X syndrome,
in which plasticity is altered.

INTRODUCTION
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (22 nucleotide) noncoding
RNAs that mediate posttranscriptional gene silencing (Filipowicz
et al., 2008; Rana, 2007). miRNAs are loaded into effector
proteins of the Argonaute family. Once loaded the Argonaute
protein is said to be ‘‘programmed’’ with the miRNA, which
guides the Argonaute protein to specific mRNA targets. miRNAs
usually bind their target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing
in the 30 untranslated region (UTR) and impact protein expression
by inhibiting mRNA translation or by promoting mRNA decay.
In mammals, several hundred distinct miRNAs have been
discovered, including those selectively expressed in the brain
(Cao et al., 2006). miRNAs play roles in early development

(Stefani and Slack, 2008) and in diseases such as cancer
(Esquela-Kerscher and Slack, 2006) and neurodegeneration
(Eacker et al., 2009), yet only a small number of miRNA targets
have been validated and shown to be functionally important
in vivo (Schratt, 2009). In mammals, miR-132 regulates dendrite
development by targeting p250GAP (Vo et al., 2005; Wayman
et al., 2008) and miR-134 and 138 have been implicated in
dendritic spine development through repression of LIMK1 and
APT1 (Schratt et al., 2006; Siegel et al., 2009).
Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited cause
of mental retardation (Bagni and Greenough, 2005; Bassell and
Warren, 2008), is usually due to a trinucleotide expansion in
the FMR1 gene that results in transcriptional silencing of FMRP
(fragile X mental retardation protein) expression. FMRP contains
multiple RNA-binding domains and is widely thought to function
as a translational suppressor of specific mRNAs, including
MAP1b, CaMKIIa, and Arc (Bassell and Warren, 2008).
FMRP is biochemically and genetically linked to the miRNA
pathway. FMRP interacts with proteins (e.g., Argonaute and
Dicer) in the RNA interference silencing complex (RISC) and
with miRNAs, but FMRP itself is not essential for RNAi-mediated
mRNA cleavage (Bolduc et al., 2008; Caudy et al., 2002; Cheever
and Ceman, 2009; Hock et al., 2007; Ishizuka et al., 2002; Jin
et al., 2004b; Okamura et al., 2004; Plante et al., 2006). Heterozygous loss of AGO1 enhances the phenotype of heterozygous
loss of FMRP in flies, suggesting AGO1 facilitates translational
repression by FMRP (Bolduc et al., 2008; Jin et al., 2004b).
One hypothesis is that specific miRNAs—as part of the FMRP
translation regulatory complex—could facilitate selection and/
or suppression of target mRNAs by FMRP (Jin et al., 2004a).
However, no specific example of such a functional association
of FMRP, mRNA, and miRNA has been identified.
Although 22 nucleotide RNA has been detected in the
FMRP-complex (Caudy et al., 2002; Ishizuka et al., 2002; Jin
et al., 2004b), it is unknown which specific miRNAs associate
with FMRP in mammals. We hypothesized that such FMRPassociated miRNAs might regulate synaptic function and
dendritic spine structure, given the well-established synaptic
abnormalities found in FMR1 knockout (KO) mice that are also
central to the pathogenesis of FXS in humans (Comery et al.,
1997; Irwin et al., 2001). Here we report that two FMRP-associated miRNAs (miR-125b and miR-132) can affect dendritic spine

targets that are also associated with FMRP and encode key
proteins involved in synaptic function.
RESULTS
FMRP-Associated miRNAs in Mouse Brain
To identify FMRP-associated miRNAs, we purified FMRP from
mouse brain using FMRP antibodies and isolated the associated
miRNAs following a protocol commonly used for the identification of mRNA targets of FMRP (Brown et al., 2001). As a control
for specificity of miRNA association, we also used FMRP antibodies to immunoprecipitate from FMR1 KO brains (Figure 1A).
We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
to measure the amount of mature miRNAs coimmunoprecipitated with anti-FMRP antibodies. A specific set of miRNAs
was quantified: the brain-specific miRNAs 9, 124, 128; miRNAs
132 and 219, which are inducible by CREB, an important
transcription factor implicated in learning and memory; and
two miRNAs previously reported to regulate spine morphology,
miRNAs 134 and 138 (Cao et al., 2006; Schratt et al., 2006; Siegel
et al., 2009; Vo et al., 2005). Additionally, we looked for broadly
expressed miRNAs of high (miRNAs 26a, 29a, 125b, 127, and
let-7c), intermediate (miRNAs 22, and 125a), and low abundance
(miRNAs 27b, 100, and 143) (Landgraf et al., 2007; Pena et al.,
2009). Twelve of these candidate miRNAs were found to associate with FMRP (Figure 1B). That is, let-7c, miR-9, 100, 124,

374 Neuron 65, 373–384, February 11, 2010 ª2010 Elsevier Inc.

125a, 125b, 127, 128, 132, 138, 143, and 219 were enriched
3- to 7-fold in FMRP immunoprecipitates from age-matched
wild-type brains as compared with control immunoprecipitates
from FMR1 KO brains. Expression levels for all tested miRNAs
were indistinguishable between brains from wild-type and
FMR1 KO mice (data not shown). In addition, a small nucleolar
RNA (snoRNA-135) and five other miRNAs (miR-22, 26a, 27b,
29a, and 134) did not show significant coprecipitation with
FMRP above the background seen in FMR1 KO brain, indicating
that there is selectivity of miRNA association with FMRP
(Figure 1B).
Effects of FMRP-Associated miRNAs
on Spine Morphology
We asked whether specific miRNAs associated with FMRP
might be involved in the regulation of spine morphogenesis. To
determine the gain-of-function phenotype of the miRNAs, we
transfected dissociated rat hippocampal neurons in culture
with DNA plasmids that express the precursor-miRNA hairpin
under the control of a b-actin promoter (Zeng et al., 2005). Overexpression of the mature miRNA in neurons was validated using
EGFP-based miRNA-sensors containing artificial miRNA target
sites in their 30 UTR (see Figure S1A available online).
Hippocampal neurons were transfected at 14 days in vitro
(DIV14) with individual miRNAs and EGFP marker for 3 days
(DIV14+3). Dendritic protrusions were differentially affected by
miR-125b and miR-132. Overexpression of miR-125b resulted
in longer and thinner protrusions (Figures 2A–2C). In neurons
overexpressing miR-125b, 20% of dendritic protrusions were
very long (>3 mm), versus 5%–10% in untransfected neurons
or in neurons transfected with other miRNAs (Figure 2E). This
difference was even more marked for protrusions > 5 mm. Protrusion density was not affected. miR-125b, let-7c, miR-22,
miR-124, miR-132, and miR-143 did not have a statistically
significant effect on dendritic growth or arborization as
measured by Sholl analysis (Figures 2A and S2).
In contrast, neurons overexpressing miR-132 were characterized by stubby and mushroom spines (Figure 2A). Overexpressed miR-132 caused an increase in average protrusion
width, without affecting the average length (Figures 2B and
2C). In addition, average protrusion density fell significantly by
15% (Figure 2D). The effects of miRNAs 125b and 132 on
dendritic spine width appear to be specific, because overexpression of let-7c, miR-22, miR-124, miR-9, and miR-128
(Figure 2 and data not shown) had no significant effect on spine
number or shape compared with vector control. Although
miR-132 has been implicated in regulating neuron morphology
(Siegel et al., 2009; Vo et al., 2005; Wayman et al., 2008), here
we show a role for miR-125b in spine morphogenesis.
FMRP Is Required for the Effect of miR-125b
and miR-132 on Spine Morphology
To test whether regulation of spine morphology by miR-125b
and 132 is dependent on FMRP, we overexpressed the miRNA
constructs in neurons either with FMRP-shRNA or control luciferase shRNA constructs (Zhang and Macara, 2006). In our
experiments, FMRP knockdown (DIV14+3) by itself did not
affect spine morphology (Figure 3). The lack of effect of FMRP

Figure 2. Overexpression of FMRP-Associated miRNAs Differentially Affects Dendritic Spine Morphology
(A) Hippocampal neurons at DIV14 were cotransfected with plasmids expressing specific miRNAs (see Figure S1A) and EGFP to outline neuron morphology.
Three days posttransfection (DIV14+3) neurons were fixed, immunostained for EGFP, and imaged by confocal microscopy to visualize dendritic arborization
and spine morphology. Low-magnification images show transfected whole neurons, and higher-magnification images show representative dendritic segments
of these cells. Scale bars represent 10 mm (upper and lower panels).

suppression might be explained by the acute manipulation
(compared with FMR1 KO mice) and by the fact that the effect
of FMRP on spine morphology declines in neurons of this age
(Nimchinsky et al., 2001). We validated FMRP-knockdown and
specificity of two shRNA constructs (#1 and #2) in HEK293 cells
and cultured hippocampal neurons (Figure S3). ShRNA FMRP #1
(and to a lesser extent #2) reduced expression of cotransfected
EGFP-FMRP (Antar et al., 2004) and endogenous FMRP immunofluorescence.
Control Luc shRNA expression did not affect the differential
spine phenotypes induced by miR-125 or 132 overexpression
(Figures 2 and 3). Compared with miR-143, a miRNA that does
not affect dendritic spines (Figure 2), miR-125b-overexpressing
neurons had significantly longer and thinner dendritic protrusions, whereas miR-132 expression increased protrusion width
and reduced spine density. In cells with knockdown of FMRP,
however, the effects of miR-125 and 132 were abolished and
spine morphology was not significantly different from miR-143
control. These data indicate that FMRP is required for miR-125b
and 132 to alter spine morphology. Because FMRP is not needed
for general RNAi function (Caudy et al., 2002; Hock et al., 2007),

these findings support the idea that the FMRP-associated
miRNAs 125b and 132 modulate dendritic spine morphology
together with FMRP through common mRNA targets.
Sequestration of FMRP-Associated miRNA Affects
Neuron Morphology
To investigate the loss-of-function phenotype of individual
miRNAs on spine morphology, we applied the plasmid-based
‘‘sponge’’ method of Ebert et al. (2007). Overexpression of
mRNA constructs containing multiple (five to seven) concatenated miRNA binding sites with central mismatches (that prevent
AGO2-mediated mRNA cleavage) results in the sequestration of
endogenous miRNAs that bind to these sequences (Figure S1B).
Because the eight 50 -most nucleotides of a miRNA, the so-called
‘‘seed’’ region, is thought to be critical for target sequence
recognition, this approach leads to cross-capture of related
miRNA isoforms with identical seed regions (e.g., let-7a through
let-7i, or miR-125a and 125b). In these cases, the sponge
constructs are denoted according to the miRNA family sequestered (e.g., let-7 and miR-125 sponge). Specificity and efficacy
of miRNA suppression was confirmed for each sponge in

hippocampal neurons, indicating sufficient sequestration and
functional suppression of targeted endogenous miRNAs. For
example, transfection of a sponge construct for miR-124, the
most abundant miRNA in brain, upregulated expression of
a sensor containing target sequences for miR-124 by 5-fold,
but had no effect on other sensors containing unrelated miRNA
target sites (Figure S1C).
The effects of individual miRNA sponges on neuron
morphology were examined in hippocampal neurons 3 days
after transfection (DIV14+3) (Figure 4). Loss-of-function of the
abundant neuronal miRNAs let-7 and miR-124, and of the less
abundant miR-125 and miR-132 (Landgraf et al., 2007), caused
a marked pruning of the dendritic arbor, as quantified by Sholl
analysis (Figures 4A and 4E). Primary dendrites ramified less
and the dendritic arbor covered a smaller area. By contrast,
sponges targeting miR-22 and miR-143 had little effect on
dendrite complexity (Figures 4A and 4E).
Conversely to miR-125b gain-of-function, which reduced
spine width (Figure 2C), miR-125 loss-of-function significantly
increased protrusion width (Figure 4C). Moreover, neurons
transfected with sponges for let-7, miR-22 and miR-124 also
showed a modest but significant increase in protrusion width.
Only the let-7 sponge significantly increased protrusion length
(Figure 4B) and none of the sponge constructs tested affected
the density of protrusions (Figure 4D). The lack of effect of
sponging of miR-132 and miR-143 could be explained by an
activity-dependent role for miR-132 and low basal expression
of miR-132 and miR-143 (Landgraf et al., 2007). Because overexpression and sponging of miR-125b had opposite effects on

protrusion width, these data corroborate the idea that miR-125b
is important for regulating spine morphology.
miR-125b and miR-132 Differentially Modify Synaptic
Strength
Spine size often correlates with synaptic strength. We therefore
measured AMPA receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in cultured hippocampal neurons
transfected with miR-125b and miR-132 constructs (Figure 5).
Overexpression of miR-125b resulted in a significant 25% drop
in mean mEPSC amplitude (Figures 5A and 5C). The weakening
of synaptic transmission is consistent with the long thin protrusions and the reduced spine width induced by miR-125b
(Figure 2C). In neurons overexpressing miR-125b, mEPSC
frequency fell relative to control neurons transfected with empty
vector, but this did not reach the level of statistical significance
(Figure 5C). Suppressing endogenous miR-125b activity with
the miR-125 sponge had no significant effect on mEPSC amplitude or frequency (Figures 5A and 5C), consistent with the modest
effect of miR-125b sponging on spine morphology (Figure 4).
In contrast to miR-125b, overexpression of miR-132 led to an
increase in mean mEPSC amplitude (Figures 5B and 5D), consistent with the wider spines induced by miR-132 (Figure 2C).
Miniature EPSC frequency was also considerably elevated by
miR-132 overexpression (Figure 5D), even though spine density
was decreased by this miRNA (Figures 2D and 3D). This could
reflect a greater number of miniature events detected with the
increased amplitude of mEPSC. The miR-132 sponge did not
affect either amplitude or frequency of mEPSCs. Overall, these

electrophysiological findings are consistent with and corroborate the effects of miR-125b and miR-132 on the structure of
dendritic spines.
mRNAs Encoding for Synaptic Proteins Are Targeted
by FMRP-Associated miRNAs
We asked which target genes might mediate the bidirectional
effects of miR-125b and miR-132 on synaptic physiology.
shRNA-mediated knockdown of the known miR-132 target
p250GAP was recently found to increase dendritic spine size
(Nakazawa et al., 2008; Vo et al., 2005; Wayman et al., 2008).
This is in accord with the spine enlargement upon miR-132
expression in our experiments (Figure 2).
We focused on miR-125b target mRNAs predicted by TargetScan (Lewis et al., 2005) that might contribute to the induction
of long thin protrusions and altered synaptic function. Target
prediction mainly relies on the presence of a seed match to a
miRNA in the 30 UTR of an mRNA that is conserved between
species. For example, the 30 UTR of the NR2A subunit of
NMDA receptors contains such a conserved sequence complementary to the seed region of miR-125b (Figure 6A).

To validate candidate miRNA targets, we fused the 30 UTRs of
the specific mRNAs to the coding sequence of firefly luciferase
(FF-luc). The FF-luc reporter construct was then cotransfected
with plasmids expressing individual miRNAs in HEK293 cells,
along with a plasmid encoding Renilla reniformis luciferase
(RR-luc) for normalization. miRNA expression was validated
using FF-luc reporters containing perfect-match miRNA targetsites (Figure S4).
Most of the tested FF-luc 30 UTR reporters of predicted target
genes were unaffected by miRNA coexpression (Figure S5). We
found slight suppression of GluR2 (by miR-124a) and Eph
receptor A4 (EphA4, by let-7c, miR-22 and possibly miR-125b).
Only the NR2A 30 UTR reporter was strongly inhibited by coexpression of miR-125b (45%), consistent with the conserved
seed match (Figures 6A and 6B). By contrast, coexpression of
let-7c, miR-22 and miR-124 had no effect on NR2A reporter
expression, and no seed matches to these miRNAs exist in the
NR2A 30 UTR. FF-luc reporter constructs containing the 30 UTR
of the other NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B (containing
no such seed region) were not affected by the tested miRNAs
(Figure 6B).

NR2B mRNA was also enriched in FMRP immunoprecipitates
from wild-type mouse brains (4-fold over the background level
from FMR1 KOs), even though NR2B is not a predicted target of
any of the miRNAs we tested in this study. NR2B may be regulated by other miRNAs or associate with FMRP independent of
miRNAs.
In contrast to NR2A and NR2B, the NR1 mRNA was not associated with FMRP by the coimmunoprecipitation assay (Figure 8A), nor was there coprecipitation of GAPDH mRNAs, a
commonly used negative control that is believed not to be regulated by FMRP (Brown et al., 2001). However, we found
p250GAP (which is reported to be regulated by miR-132) to be
significantly associated with FMRP (Figure 8A). p250GAP had
not been implicated in FXS previously.
To rule out artificial association between FMRP and mRNAs
during immunoprecipitation, we utilized a novel comixing assay
that confirms interaction in the intact brain. We homogenized
wild-type rat brain together with 5-fold excess FMR1 KO
mouse brain and determined the species distribution of mRNAs
in FMRP immunoprecipitates using diagnostic restriction analysis of cloned cDNA fragments (Figures 8B and S7). Thus,
only rat FMRP protein, but both rat and mouse mRNAs are
present during immunoprecipitation. For mRNAs interacting
with FMRP in vivo, mainly rat mRNA should be found in the
immunoprecipitation of FMRP. For GAPDH and NR1, which
were not enriched in FMRP immunoprecipitates (Figure 8A),
the ratio of rat versus mouse cDNA clones was not significantly
different in FMRP immunoprecipitates and input material,

indicating nonspecific contamination with these mRNAs (Figure 8B). In contrast, for the positive control MAP1B and the putative FMRP-target genes NR2A, NR2B, and p250GAP, the fraction of rat cDNA clones was much higher in the FMRP
immunoprecipitates than in the mixed rat/mouse brain extract.
Thus, ‘‘species-tagging’’ confirmed that the interaction of
MAP1B, NR2A, NR2B, and p250GAP mRNA with FMRP
occurred prior to homogenization in vivo.
Among the tested genes only NR2B showed a small change in
mRNA level in the FMR1 KO (133 ± 10% compared with 100 ±
5% in the wild-type, p < 0.05), which is in keeping with the belief
that FMRP mainly regulates the translation of its target genes
rather than mRNA abundance. We therefore measured the
protein levels of NMDA receptor subunits in hippocampus of
FMR1 KO mice at 7 and 14 days after birth. Consistent with
previous reports (Giuffrida et al., 2005), we found no significant
difference in NR2A, NR2B, or p250GAP total protein levels
between wild-type and KO (Figure S8).
Inappropriate development or compensatory mechanisms
(e.g., on the level of transcription or degradation) might obscure
dysregulation of NR2A in FMR1 KO mice (Yashiro and Philpot,
2008). Thus we used acute knockdown of FMRP in hippocampal
neurons and FF-luc 30 UTR reporters to circumvent these confounding factors. Acute knockdown of FMRP using shRNA #1
strongly stimulated the expression of the NR2A 30 UTR reporter
(by 2.5-fold) compared with control shRNAs targeting zinc
transporter 3 (ZnT3) or EGFP (Figure 8C). In contrast, FMRP
knockdown did not affect the NR1 reporter and even slightly
reduced NR2B reporter expression. These data suggest that
FMRP has a suppressive action on the 30 UTR of NR2A in neurons.
Because Argonaute proteins interacting with FMRP may
contribute to miRNA-dependent translational repression of

FMRP target genes, we asked whether knockdown of Argonaute
1 (AGO1) also affects the NR2A 30 UTR reporter. AGO1, which is
highly expressed in the central nervous system, lacks endonuclease activity but supports translational repression of
mismatch-containing miRNA targets (Filipowicz et al., 2008;
Lu et al., 2005). Therefore we took advantage of an shRNA target
sequence with validated specificity for AGO1 (Meister et al.,
2004b). AGO1 knockdown increased expression of the NR2A
30 UTR reporter by 70%, but had no effect on the NR2B reporter
(Figure 8C). There was also a slight increase in NR1 30 UTR
reporter expression with AGO1 suppression.
To test whether the NR2A 30 UTR is regulated by FMRP in a
miR-125b-dependent manner, we compared regulation of
NR2A reporter constructs containing or lacking the miR-125b
target site. Basal translation of the NR2A D125 reporter was
4-fold higher than wild-type, consistent with derepression
due to loss of miR-125 binding. In fold terms, the NR2A D125
reporter was significantly less induced by FMRP knockdown
than wild-type NR2A (Figure 8D), implying that miR-125 contributes in part to FMRP-dependent NR2A regulation. We attribute
the differential effect of FMRP knockdown on NR2A wild-type
versus NR2A D125 to a functional interaction between FMRP
and miR-125 on the control of NR2A 30 UTR. Other mechanisms
independent of miRNAs or dependent on other miRNAs likely
exist to regulate NR2A expression. A second shRNA (FMRP
#2) that is less effective in knocking down FMRP also induced
the NR2A 30 UTR reporter dependent on the miR-125b target
site, but to a weaker extent than shRNA FMRP #1 (Figures S3
and 8D). Together these data indicate that the 30 UTR of NR2A
(but not NR1 or NR2B) is normally suppressed by FMRP and
AGO1 as well as by miR-125, and these mechanisms show
partial functional interaction.

DISCUSSION
FMRP-Associated miRNAs in Brain
The interaction of FMRP with Argonaute proteins led to the idea
that miRNAs could facilitate the selection and/or silencing of
mRNA targets by FMRP (Caudy et al., 2002; Ishizuka et al.,
2002; Jin et al., 2004b). We found that many brain miRNAs (12
out of 17 tested) are associated with FMRP. So far, enrichment
of specific miRNAs (including miR-125) had only been reported
in FMRP immunoprecipitates from fly ovaries (Yang et al., 2009).
How do miRNAs interact with FMRP? The lack of a canonical
miRNA/siRNA binding domain in FMRP suggests that miRNAs
are indirectly associated with FMRP, possibly through Argonaute
proteins that contain a miRNA binding domain and interact with
FMRP in an RNA-independent manner (Caudy et al., 2002;
Ishizuka et al., 2002). We found that AGO1 knockdown enhanced
NR2A reporter expression similar to FMRP knockdown, which is
consistent with the genetic interaction between FMRP and Argonaute found in flies (Bolduc et al., 2008; Jin et al., 2004b). Direct
interaction with miRNA has been reported for purified FMRP
in vitro (Plante et al., 2006). It is possible that miRNA and mRNA
together could act as the ‘‘kissing complex’’ RNA structure
proposed to bind the KH2 domain (Bassell and Warren, 2008;
Darnell et al., 2005a). Our data cannot tell whether miRNAs associate with FMRP directly or indirectly (e.g., through independent
binding of miRNA and FMRP to the same mRNA complex), nor
do they reveal the molecular mechanism by which miR-125b and
FMRP collaborate to suppress NR2A 30 UTR-regulated translation.
The data that suggest a functional interaction of FMRP and
specific miRNAs in neurons can be summarized as follows. First,
knockdown of FMRP prevented the very different effects of overexpression of FMRP-associated miRNAs 125b and 132 on spine
morphology. Second, removing the miR-125b target site from
the NR2A 30 UTR dampens regulation of the latter by FMRP,
implying that miR-125b assists FMRP in regulating NR2A. We
emphasize that miRNAs 125b and 132 could also have multiple
effects in neurons that are independent of FMRP.
Regulation of Synapse Structure and Function
by miR-125b and miR-132
Remarkably, miR-125b and miR-132 showed largely opposing
effects on dendritic spines. Overexpression of miR-125b
induced long narrow spines, which correlated with a reduction
in mEPSC amplitude. Conversely, sponging of endogenous
miR-125 increased the average width of dendritic protrusions.
These results provide strong evidence that miR-125b regulates
synapse structure and function. Interestingly, endogenous
miR-125b levels are highest in young neurons (DIV3), when filopodia-like protrusions are predominant. Recent studies using
gene ontology analysis of putative miR-125b targets suggests
a role for this miRNA in neuronal differentiation and cytoskeletal
organization (Chi et al., 2009; Le et al., 2009).
We identified NR2A as a target gene of miR-125b, but unlike
NR1 and NR2B, this NMDAR subunit has so far not been linked
to spine morphogenesis (Alvarez et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2005;
Ultanir et al., 2007). NR2A overexpression did not rescue the
effect of miR-125b overexpression on spine morphology (data
not shown), suggesting NR2A downregulation is not a major

cause of altered spine morphology. In reporter assays the
EphA4 30 UTR was modestly repressed by miR-125b (Figure S5).
Because loss of EphA4 promotes the formation of filopodia-like
protrusions in hippocampal neurons (Murai et al., 2003), it is
possible that the suppression of EphA4 (together with other
unidentified targets) contributes to the miR-125b overexpression
phenotype.
In contrast to miR-125b, overexpressing miR-132 hippocampal neurons increased dendritic protrusion width and
increased mEPSC amplitude. Recently, Siegel et al. (2009) reported that miR-132 inhibition caused a slight reduction in spine
volume. In our hands, sponging of miR-132 had little effect on
dendritic spines, but caused a significant reduction in dendritic
complexity. This is consistent with the positive effect of miR132 on dendrite branching through repression of p250GAP,
which has been described in younger neurons (Vo et al., 2005;
Wayman et al., 2008). Knockdown of p250GAP has recently
been shown to enlarge dendritic spines in mouse neurons (Nakazawa et al., 2008), which could help explain the increased spine
width we observed upon miR-132 overexpression.
The fact that miR-125b and miR-132 associate with FMRP and
affect dendritic spine morphology does not necessarily mean
that these miRNAs play a key role in the spine phenotype of
FXS. The complexity of this issue is highlighted by the opposing
effects of miR-125b and miR-132 on spine size and shape.
Indeed it is unlikely that a single or a few FMRP-associated
miRNAs (or mRNAs) can fully explain the morphological and
functional features of FXS.
Regulation of NR2A by miR-125b and FMRP
The 30 UTR of NR2A contains an evolutionarily conserved site
that matches the miR-125b target sequence and that largely
mediates suppression by endogenous miR-125b in neurons.
We confirmed regulation of NR2A upon miR-125b overexpression and sponging by use of luciferase reporters, immunoblotting of endogenous protein levels and NMDAR-EPSC recordings. In addition to being controlled by miR-125, the NR2A
30 UTR reporter was also upregulated by knockdown of FMRP
or AGO1. Importantly, deleting the major miR-125b target site
within the NR2A 30 UTR impairs upregulation by FMRP knockdown, suggesting that miR-125b participates in FMRP regulation of NR2A. Consistent with NR2A mRNA being a target of
FMRP, we found NR2A mRNA to be associated with FMRP in
rodent brain. Together, these data suggest that NR2A translation
may be regulated by miR-125b and FMRP in vivo.
We could not detect significant changes in total protein levels
of NR1, NR2A, or NR2B in the hippocampus of FMR1 KO mice
(Figure S8). This is perhaps not surprising, given that FMR1
KO usually has subtle or no overt effects even on expression of
‘‘established’’ FMRP target genes (Bassell and Warren, 2008;
Darnell et al., 2005b; Muddashetty et al., 2007). Moreover,
FMRP may regulate its target mRNAs only at a specific subcellular location without altering total protein levels. Given that the
NR2A/NR2B ratio appears to be an important determinant of
NMDA receptor signaling, even subtle effects on NR2A expression by miRNAs might influence synaptic plasticity (Barria and
Malinow, 2005; Kim et al., 2005; Philpot et al., 2007). It should
be pointed out, however, that miR-125b and FMRP impact

miR-125b and miR-132 Regulate Synaptic Function

multiple targets and pathways, and altered expression of NR2A
per se is unlikely to be the key mediator of miR-125b and FMRP
effects on synapse structure and function.
What is known about NMDA receptor function in FMR1 KO
mice? Loss of FMRP enhances NMDAR function in young mice
(Pfeiffer and Huber, 2007; Pilpel et al., 2009) but not in adult
mice (Pilpel et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2005). Moreover, several
forms of NMDA-receptor-dependent plasticity are impaired by
loss of FMRP. LTP is abolished in cortex and amygdala (but
not hippocampus), the threshold for spike-timing-dependent
plasticity is increased, and ocular dominance plasticity is altered
(Desai et al., 2006; Dolen et al., 2007; Li et al., 2002; Meredith
et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2005). These are changes that could
conceivably be due, in part, to altered NMDA receptor function
or signaling at the synapse. Investigating NMDA receptor function in greater detail in FMR1 KO mice should be informative
and may lead to novel intervention strategies for FXS treatment.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Antibodies
NR1 (mouse, BD Bioscience), NR2A (rabbit, Covance), NR2B (mouse, Neuromab), PSD-95 (mouse, Neuromab), FMRP (rabbit, ab17722, Abcam), b-galactosidase (rabbit, ICN; mouse, Promega), EGFP (rabbit, MBL), b3-tubulin
(mouse, Sigma), MAP1B (mouse, Santa Cruz), EphA4 (rabbit, Santa Cruz),
and p250GAP antibody (Nakazawa et al., 2003) were used.
DNA Constructs
For miRNA expression in neurons, we cloned the complete miRNA precursor
hairpin with ten nucleotide genomic context extending to the 50 and 30 side of
the stem in each direction (to allow proper processing) using synthetic oligonucleotides (Table S1) into a vector containing the chicken b-actin promoter
(Zeng et al., 2005). These constructs were used in Figures S1, S2, 2, 3, 5,
and 7B. A second generation of miRNA expression constructs based on the
FhSynW vector (Nakagawa et al., 2006) allowed robust expression in
HEK293 cells and lentiviral packaging. Genomic miRNA precursor sequences
(165 to 376 nucleotide fragments) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the
30 UTR of mCherry (Shaner et al., 2004) driven by the human synapsin 1
promoter. These constructs were used for transfection (Figures S4, S5, and
6B) and lentiviral expression (Figure 7A). Viral particles were packaged using
a third-generation system (Tiscornia et al., 2006).
For single-cell analysis, EGFP-based miRNA sensors were constructed by
cloning several perfect match miRNA target sites into the 30 UTR of a TK
promoter-driven EGFP. mOrange (Shaner et al., 2004) was expressed from
the same plasmid to identify transfected cells regardless of EGFP expression
level. For quantification using luciferase assays, the miRNA target sites were
subcloned into the 30 UTR of FF-luc (driven by human synapsin 1 promoter).
Specific miRNA sponges (Ebert et al., 2007) were constructed by concatemerizing annealed oligonucleotides containing a bulged-match miRNA
binding site inside of two linkers, each containing restriction sites for cloning
(see Table S1). After ligation, the appropriate size concatemers were PCR
amplified and cloned (NotI-SalI) into the 30 UTR of mCherry cDNA driven by
b-actin promoter.
30 UTRs fragments of putative miRNA targets (Table S1) were cloned from rat
brain cDNA into a modified pGL3-control vector (Promega). In neurons, NR1,
NR2A, and NR2B 30 UTR FF-luc reporter were expressed under the control of
human synapsin 1 promoter to boost FF-luc activity.
shRNA targeting FMRP (rat and mouse, #1 GTGATGAAGTTGAGGTTTA and
#2 CCACCAAATCGTACAGATA), AGO1 (rat and human, GAGAAGAGGTGCT
CAAGAA) (Meister et al., 2004a), Luc (CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA) (Zhang
and Macara, 2006), ZnT3 (rat and mouse, GCCTCATCCCGGCTCTATT, gift
from J. Jaworski) and EGFP (GCAAAGACCCCAACGAGAA, gift from J. Jaworski) at the indicated sites were cloned into pSUPER (Oligoengine). All
constructs were verified by DNA-sequencing.

FMRP-IP, RNA Extraction, Reverse Transcription,
and Quantitative PCR
We followed the standard procedure for FMRP immunoprecipitation used to
identify mRNA targets (Brown et al., 2001). Mouse brains were homogenized
in 2 ml ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 200 mM NaCl, 30 mM
EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 U/ml SUPERase inhibitor, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 1:100). After removing the nuclear fraction (3000 g,
10 min), the NaCl concentration was raised to 400 mM to dissociate FMRP
from ribosomes and insoluble material was removed (70,000 g, 20 min). After
adding 100 mg/ml yeast tRNA (Sigma) to block nonspecific RNA binding, the
extracts were precleared with Protein A-Sepharose (30 min at 4 C). One part
of the extract was saved and ten parts were used for immunoprecipitation
with FMRP antibodies (15 mg with 40 ml Protein A-Sepharose slurry) for 2 hr at
4 C. Beads were washed five times with lysis buffer containing 0.1 U/ml
SUPERase inhibitor and 10 mg/ml yeast tRNA (for the first four washes only).
Bound RNA was extracted with mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystems) and subjected to real-time RT-PCR using TaqMan assays to quantify
mature miRNAs (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR green PCR (Applied Biosystems) for mRNA quantification (see Table S1 for oligonucleotides). For the latter,
RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers with the Message
Sensor kit (Applied Biosystems). miRNA recovery was calculated as the ratio of
miRNA found in FMRP-immunoprecipitation compared with brain extracts and
normalized to spliceosomal RNA U6 (also quantified using a TaqMan assay) to
compensate for unspecific RNA pulldown. mRNA recovery was calculated
accordingly and normalized to PGK1, all quantified by SYBR green PCR.
Analysis of ‘‘Species-Tagged’’ mRNA in FMRP Immunoprecipitates
Half a rat brain (containing FMRP-bound mRNA) was homogenized together
with four FMR1 KO mouse brains (lacking FMRP). An aliquot of the resulting
lysate and the FMRP immunoprecipitate (prepared as above) was subjected
to RNA extraction and reverse transcription. Specific gene fragments were
PCR amplified until saturation using bispecific primers matching rat and
mouse mRNAs (50 cycles using taq, Sigma). PCR products were TOPO cloned
into pCR4 vector (Invitrogen). After transformation the inserts from 48 individual colonies were PCR amplified (with backbone-specific primers CACA
CAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATG and GACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG).
Five microliters of the PCR reaction was analyzed using species-specific
restriction enzymes for GAPDH (rat MboI, mouse HindIII), MAP1b (rat BanII,
mouse MboII), NR1 (rat BanII, mouse PflFI), NR2A (rat MboI, mouse BsrBI),
NR2B (rat MspI, mouse BsaHI), or p250GAP (rat MboII, mouse HinP1I).
Neuron Culture, Transfection, and Immunostaining
Hippocampal neurons were cultured from embryonic day 19 rat embryos as
described previously (Tada et al., 2007). After transfection (Lipofectamine
2000, Invitrogen) neuron morphology was visualized by cotransfected EGFP
or b-galactosidase. Confocal microscopy and analysis of neuron morphology
were as described previously (Tada et al., 2007). Image acquisition and
analysis were performed blind to the experimental conditions.
Electrophysiology
Miniature synaptic events from sister cultures of hippocampal neurons cotransfected with EGFP and miRNA overexpression or sponge constructs
were recorded and analyzed as described previously (Seeburg et al., 2008).
Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures from postnatal day 8 rats were
prepared, cultured, and biolistically transfected (DIV11+4) as described elsewhere (Futai et al., 2007). Evoked NMDA receptor currents from CA1 pyramidal
neurons were recorded at room temperature (Futai et al., 2007).
Luciferase Assays
HEK293 cells were cotransfected with FF-luc 30 UTR reporters and constructs
expressing RR-luc, miRNA, and EGFP at a DNA ratio of 40:40:80:10 using Lipofectamine 2000. All experiments were performed in 96-well plates with six
replicates for each condition. Two days after transfection luciferase activity
was quantified using Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega). Relative expression of reporter constructs was determined by normalizing the ratio of FF-luc
and RR-luc activity to a control miRNA (let-7c or miR-124) and the effect of
each miRNA on a control FF-luc reporter (not containing the heterologous

Neuron

30 UTR). Similarly, hippocampal neurons (DIV4) were cotransfected with plasmids expressing shRNA or sponges, FF-luc reporters, RR-luc, and EGFP
at a DNA ratio of 60:40:40:10 using Lipofectamine 2000 and analyzed 3 days
later as above.
FMR1 KO Mice and Quantitative Immunoblotting
FMR1 KO mice (Dutch-Belgian Fragile X Consortium, 1994) in C57/B6 background were obtained from S. Tonegawa. Mouse housing and euthanasia
were performed in compliance with federal and institutional guidelines. For
each experiment age-matched male mice, if possible from the same litter,
were used. Hippocampi were homogenized in 0.32 M sucrose, 4 mM HEPES
(pH 7.4) together with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mix (Sigma). Immunoblots were quantified by densitometry and normalized to loaded protein
(SYPRO Ruby, Invitrogen).
