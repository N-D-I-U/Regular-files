SUMMARY
Previous studies have documented that orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 (also known as
NR4A2) plays important roles in the midbrain dopamine (DA) neuron development,
differentiation, and survival. Furthermore, it has been reported that the defects in Nurr1 are
associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Thus, Nurr1 might be a potential therapeutic
target for PD. Emerging evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies has recently demonstrated
that Nurr1-activating compounds and Nurr1 gene therapy are able not only to enhance DA
neurotransmission but also to protect DA neurons from cell injury induced by environmental toxin or microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Moreover, modulators that interact
with Nurr1 or regulate its function, such as retinoid X receptor, cyclic AMP-responsive
element-binding protein, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, and Wnt/b-catenin
pathway, have the potential to enhance the effects of Nurr1-based therapies in PD. This
review highlights the recent progress in preclinical studies of Nurr1-based therapies and
discusses the outlook of this emerging therapy as a promising new generation of PD
medication.

Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD), affecting 1.5% of the global population
aged over 65 years [1], is a common neurodegenerative disease
characterized by the progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in
the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta and the striatal DA deficiency. The main clinical manifestations of PD, including bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, postural instability, and nonmotor
symptoms, seriously impair patients’ quality of life. Although the
pathogenesis of PD is still far from being clearly understood, it has
been accepted that the occurrence of PD might attribute to the
interplay of genetic and environmental factors [2]. Until now, at
least 15 causal genes have been identified to be related to PD, such
as a-synuclein, parkin, LARRK2, PINK, and DJ1 [3]. In addition,
exposure to certain environmental toxins, such as 1-methyl-4phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), rotenone, and paraquat, has been found to increase the risk of developing PD. Pathologically, PD has also been characterized by the presence of Lewy
bodies containing aggregated and misfolded a-synuclein. Moreover, neuroinflammation, reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial
dysfunction, and autophagy or proteasome system impairment
are considered as major pathogenic contributors to PD [4–6].
Current available PD therapies are mainly aimed at ameliorating motor symptoms associated with DA deficiency, including levodopa, DA agonists, catechol-O-methyltransferase

inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors [7]. Unfortunately, the current pharmaceutical treatments cannot prevent
the degeneration of DA neurons and usually lose their efficacy over time, while often accompany severe side effects
such as dyskinesia, on–off fluctuation, and peripheral reactions. Other medications such as deep brain stimulation, cell
transplantation, and gene therapy have limitations too, concerning the surgery risk and potential safety hazard. In addition, the symptomatic alleviating effects from alternative
therapies lack robust improvement, so that they usually just
serve as adjunctive medications in clinic. In general, none of
these treatments can either slow the disease progression or
maintain the viability and functions of DA neurons [8].
Therefore, mechanism-based and/or disease-modifying therapies are in urgent need for better management of PD
progression. For example, several preclinical tests of molecular
targeted therapies have been conducted and the results seem
promising [8]. It is highly speculated that these therapies may
not only have symptomatic effects, but also provide neuroprotective and neurorepairable benefits in the treatment of PD
[8]. Among those, Nurr1-based therapies for PD have attracted
great attention. Thus, in this review, we will highlight the
progress of several potential Nurr1-based strategies, including
Nurr1-activating compounds and Nurr1 gene therapy, hoping
that they may become future medication against PD.

Nurr1 is a Potential Therapeutic Target for PD

Identifying Nurr1 as a Therapeutic Target
of PD
Functions of Nurr1 in DA Neurons
Nurr1 (also known as NR4A2) is a member of NR4A subgroup
of nuclear receptor superfamily. The other two members in
NR4A subgroup are Nur77 (NR4A1) and Nor1 (NR4A3), which
may possess quite different functions as compared with Nurr1
[9]. There are many studies demonstrating that Nurr1 plays an
essential role in the development, differentiation, maintenance,
and survival of midbrain DA neurons that are mostly affected in
the brain of PD [10]. Nurr1, as a transcriptional factor, seems to
express earlier than numerous phenotypic markers of DA
neurons, such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), DA transporter
(DAT), aromatic amino acid carboxylase (AADC), and vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) [10,11]. There is an agedependent reduction in Nurr1 expression in the midbrain DA
neurons, which arouses much interest because it may possibly
explain the high morbidity of PD in the elderly people [12,13].
In addition, it has been reported that Nurr1’s immunoreactivity
is significantly decreased in the SN of patients with PD [14–16]
and numerous polymorphisms and mutations in Nurr1 have
been identified to be associated with both familial and sporadic
PD [17]. In consistence with those clinical observations, preclinical studies have also demonstrated the essential role of Nurr1
in the midbrain DA neuron development and functional maintenance [11,18–21]. Genetic deletion of Nurr1 in mice can
cause the absence of DA neurons in the SN and ventral
tegmental area, which may result in the death of the newborn
mice [11]. Several DA neuronal phenotypes such as TH and
AADC that are important in the neurotransmission of nigrostriatal pathway are missing in Nurr1-deficient mice [10].
Meanwhile, the heterozygous Nurr1-deficient mice show a
higher susceptibility of DA neurons to neurotoxins and exert
the similar age-dependent DA dysfunction even before the DA
neuron loss [18–20]. Moreover, recent Nurr1 conditional ablation mice simulate the early features of PD, showing a series of
pathological changes, including DA neuronal loss, striatal DA
reduction, and motor deficiency, which could serve as suitable
model to study PD [21].
It is clear that Nurr1 works as a transcriptional factor to regulate
several genes involved in the DA neuronal phenotypes, ranging
from the DA metabolism, neurotransmission, axonal growth,
mitochondrial function, and cell survival [17,21–23]. More and
more target genes have been found that are transcriptionally controlled by Nurr1 in DA neurons, including Dlk1, Ptpru, Klhl1,
GTP, and VIP [24–26]. Emerging evidence has suggested that
there is a complicated network between Nurr1 and other essential
transcriptional factors during the DA neuron development. Pix3
and Wnt/b-catenin pathways are the two major signaling
molecules contributing to the midbrain DA neurogenesis via
cooperating with the Nurr1 transcription complex [27–29]. In
addition, the overexpression and accumulation of a-synuclein
may interrupt the function of Nurr1 through the direct or indirect
interference with the signaling of glial cell line-derived
neurotrophic factor (GDNF), whose receptor proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret is regulated by Nurr1 [30,31],

352

J. Dong et al.

and the interaction with a-synuclein makes GDNF fail to exert
neuroprotective effect in PD [32]. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction and the correlative oxidative phosphorylation impairment have been indicated as major risk factors of PD [5]. In
Nurr1-ablated DA neurons, more than 90% of genes encoding
respiratory chains are downregulated [21]. More importantly,
Saijo et al. [33] have recently identified a new pathogenic mechanism linking Nurr1 and PD, that is, the suppressive effect of Nurr1
in the production of inflammatory factors induced neuronal
injury. Corepressor for repressor element 1 silencing transcription
factor (CoREST) repressor complex is identified as an essential
modulator in Nurr1-mediated transrepression that inflammatory
signals promote the recruitment of CoREST and Nurr1 to the p65
subunit of NF-jB, resulting in the reduction in gene transcription
of inflammatory factors [33]. Interestingly, microglia and astrocytes seem to be the primary targets for the neuroprotective effects
of Nurr1, rather than DA neurons themselves [33]. These findings
provide us an insight understanding of the effect of Nurr1 in PD
pathogenesis and open a door for future research for the therapeutic strategies based on Nurr1.

Structure and Potential Activating Sites of Nurr1
Basically, Nurr1 is an immediate early gene and its transcription
can be rapidly induced by various stimuli such as cAMP, inflammatory signals, hormones, calcium, and growth factors. These
modulators can influence the Nurr1 expression by directly acting
on the promoters or transcription regulatory element (cAMPresponse element, CArG-like element, SP-1 element) [34,35].
Nurr1, as a member of NR4A subfamily, shares similar structural
features with Nur77 and Nor1, including (1) a modulator
domain, referred to as activation function (AF)-1 in the N-terminus; (2) a conversed DNA-binding domain (DBD); (3) ligandbinding domain (LBD); and its transactivation-dependent AF-2
in the C-terminus [9]. The high conserved DBD has two zinc fingers, which is able to bind to nerve growth factor-inducible
b-binding response element as monomer or homodimers, or Nur
response element as homodimers, which are involved in the
transcription process to activate TH and DAT genes [36,37]. In
addition, Nurr1 and Nur77 can bind as monomers, homodimers,
and heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR). These RXR
heterodimers bind a motif called DR5 and can be efficiently activated by RXR ligands [38]. Unlike other nuclear receptors, NR4A
subfamily does not have LBD cavity due to the occupation of
several bulky hydrophobic residues [39]. Instead, its transcriptional activity appears to be dependent on the AF-1 domain [40].
This feature of Nurr1 makes it difficult to discover compounds
that can directly activate Nurr1 through LBD. However, several
coregulator interaction surfaces in Nurr1 LBD have been identified, such as residues 592, 593, and 577, especially the groove
between helices 11 and 12, which provides the possibility in
developing Nurr1-activating compounds based on their binding
to LBD [41,42]. Furthermore, several compounds have already
been identified to activate Nurr1 or Nur77 via their LBDs
[43–45]. In general, based on the activated functions of these
regions of Nurr1 and numerous studies of Nurr1-activating compounds, it is possible to identify small molecules activating a
Nurr1 through its different domains.

Nurr1-Activating Compounds
Great efforts have been taken to explore novel Nurr1-activating
compounds in recent years (as summarized in Table 1). These
compounds can activate Nurr1 functions and further exert
neuroprotective, neurogenic, or antiinflammatory effects.
Mercaptopurine (6-mercaptopurine or 6-MP), an antileukemia drug, is the first identified Nurr1/Nor1 agonist from highthroughput screening, which stimulates Nurr1/Nor1 through
directly binding to the N-terminal AF-1 domain [46,47]. In
addition to 6-MP, a series of benzimidazole-based compounds
with Nurr1-activating properties (EC50: 8–70 nM) have been
identified and synthesized [48]. Given that no Nurr1 ligands
have been found, a group of compounds with benzimidazole
scaffold have been screened through a reporter gene (luciferase)
assay, whose expression is regulated by Nurr1-specific DNAbinding elements. However, only the Nurr1 biological functions,
not the antiparkinsonian effects of these compounds have been
tested.
Previous reports have demonstrated that 1,1-bis (30 -indolyl)-1(aromatic) methane (C-DIM) analogs can influence the
expression of NR4A subfamily in several cancer cells [49–52].
Recently, the antiparkinsonian effects of C-DIM analogs have
been identified. Interestingly, it shows similar activating capacities
with different p-substituted phenyl (OCH3, CI, CF3, Br, t-Bu, CN,
I, and OCF3), suggesting a structure-activating relation (SAR)
existing in these compounds that contain a bis (30 -indolyl) moiety.
In addition, Li et al. have demonstrated that both N- and C-terminal domains are involved in the activation of Nurr1, but without
evidence to confirm the direct binding between C-DIM analogs
and Nurr1 [52]. Among these C-DIM analogs, C-DIM5 and CDIM8 have a higher affinity for Nur77 but with opposite effect
[49,51]. After a comparative analysis, C-DIM12 (higher affinity
for Nurr1) has the most potent neuroprotective activity and antiinflammatory effect in MPTP-lesioned rat model of PD [53]. It
could enhance the expressions of Nurr1 and Nurr1-regulated proteins such as TH and DAT, and Nurr1-mediated recruitment of
CoREST and the NF-jB-mediated inflammatory gene expression
are suppressed in SN [53–55].
Another Nurr1 activator, isoxazolo-pyridinone 7e (IP7e), has
been reported to attenuate the inflammation and neurodegeneration via inhibiting NF-jB-dependent process [56]. IP7e seems to
be a promising candidate due to its high oral bioavailability of
95% plus rapid and extensive brain absorption and distribution
[57]. However, the Nurr1-activating effect of IP7e has only been
tested in multiple sclerosis models, not in PD models. As for PD,
the analog of isoxazolo-pyridinone derivative, SH1, has been
demonstrated to be effective to improve behavioral performance
in lactacystin-lesioned PD mouse model, of which inhibition of
microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and increasing the DAspecific phenotypes may be the main mechanisms to explain its
effect [58]. In addition, SA00025, another novel Nurr1 agonist
(EC50: 2.5 nM), shows a partial neuroprotective effect in PD models induced by inflammatory stimulant poly (I:C) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). It can modulate several DA target genes and
display antiinflammatory activity by reducing the activation of
microglia and astrocytes [59].

Nurr1 is a Potential Therapeutic Target for PD

While all the above compounds have been identified as Nurr1-activating compounds, none of them are shown to activate
Nurr1 by direct physical interaction with LBD. Strikingly, Kim
et al. have recently identified antimalarial drugs amodiaquine
(AQ) and chloroquine (CQ) together with a pain-relieving drug
glafenine as a novel group of Nurr1 activators and finally demonstrated that AQ/CQ (EC50: 20–50 lM) can interact with Nurr1LBD via direct physical binding [43]. They used a series of analyses, including Biacore S51 SPR sensor, fluorescence quenching
analysis, a radioligand-binding assay by [3H]-CQ, and nuclear
magnetic resonance to estimate this phenomenon. This finding
advances our current understanding of the LBD binding properties
and opens the door for further research and development of Nurr1
agonists. Interestingly, these compounds contain an identical
4-amino-7-chloroquinoline scaffold, which may predict a possible
SAR. As for the underlying mechanisms, the inhibition of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and increase in DA-specific
gene expression are involved in the antiparkinsonian effect of
AQ/CQ. Moreover, the autophagy-regulating effects of AQ/CQ
may also predict potential interactions between Nurr1 and
autophagy for their antiparkinsonian effects [60].
These Nurr1-activating compounds provide much promising
possibilities for PD treatment and most of them exert the
antiparkinsonian effect through both the activating and suppressing functions of Nurr1. Although these compounds have
the ability to activate Nurr1, it is still not clear the exact regions
of Nurr1 targeted by these compounds. Among them, only 6-MP
and AQ have been confirmed to directly bind to the AF-1 or LBD
of Nurr1, so further studies are in urgent need to discover the
specific binding regions on Nurr1. Furthermore, the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and the side effects of
those compounds are also required to evaluate. As the other two
members of NR4A subfamily, Nur77 and Nor1, share high similar
structure with Nurr1, and they are both involved in the regulation of neurological functions and inflammation, it is of importance to test the specificity of the existing Nurr1-activating
compounds [61,62]. Wei et al. have recently indicated that Nurr1 and Nur77 might present a contradirectionally coupling interaction in memantine-mediated neuroprotection [63]. This
complicated network makes it very difficult to predict the therapeutic outcome if both Nurr1 and its homologs are activated
through the conserved regions. Moreover, SAR has been a
research hotpot recently, especially after the presentation of the
Nurr1-activating effects of C-DIM analogs and AQ/CQ. Meanwhile, we should notice the fact that subtle alternations of the
functional structure might result in a great or even opposite
effects [49,51]. Only after those concerns are well addressed, we
might be able to determine whether Nurr1-activating compounds
can provide an alternative therapy for PD.

Nurr1 Modulators
In addition to activate Nurr1 by recognition on the specific target
region of Nurr1, some other compounds, such as DA agonists,
memantine, retinoic acid-loaded polymeric nanoparticles
(RA-NPs), and herbal extracts (as summarized in Table 2), have
also been demonstrated to upregulate Nurr1 expression in

report to confirm that they can activate Nurr1 by direct binding
[63–69].
The neuroprotective effect of DA agonists has been a controversial topic for decades [70]. One recent clinical trial supports
that DA agonists can exert neuroprotection by inducing Nurr1
expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [71]. Additionally, in DA neuron cell lines, D2/D3 agonist pramipexole has a
profound effect to increase Nurr1 expression, which precedes the

upregulation of DAT and VMAT2 expressions [64], suggesting
that Nurr1 may serve as a key target for DA agonist-mediated
neuroprotection.
Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has
been demonstrated to restore PC12 cell survival from 6-OHDAinduced neurotoxicity through upregulating Nurr1 and downregulating Nur77 and partially inhibit migration of Nur77 from
nucleus to mitochondria [63]. Different from Nurr1, Nur77 usually triggers apoptotic process when migrates to mitochondria

and induces inflammation via NF-jB pathway [72,73]. Interestingly, administration of DA activators could decrease Nur77
expression [74], suggesting that Nurr1 together with the
contradirectional coupling of Nurr1/Nur77 might be involved in
PD pathogenesis.
Besides those chemically synthesized compounds, several Nurr1-modulators from natural source, such as moracenin D, EGb
761, radicicol, and Bushen Huoxue decoction (BHD), are also
effective in PD therapy [65–68]. Moracenin D, an extract from
Mori Cortex radices, significantly upregulates Nurr1 expression
and downregulates a-synuclein expression [65]. EGb 761,
extracted from Ginkgo biloba leaves, has been applied in clinical
trials of treating several neuropsychiatric diseases [75,76]. It also
exerts neuroprotective effect in MPTP-lesioned mice via increasing the expression of a series of DA-related genes, of which Nurr1
is increased by 148% in SN [66]. Our previous study has shown
that radicicol could induce HSP70 expression in SH-SY5Y cells
against rotenone-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of P53
and induction of Nurr1 [67]. It has been reported that the medical

ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

decoction BHD could also increase Nurr1 expression. The
antiparkinsonian effect of BHD has been tested in clinical trials
[68,77].
Biomaterials as therapeutic tools have been developed to help
Nurr1-based PD therapy recently. Retinoic acid (RA) can enhance
the survival and maturation of neuronal cells and RA receptors
are highly expressed in DA neurons [78]. In contrast to
conventional RA formulations, the recently developed novel
nanoparticles coupled with RA could rapidly transport into cells to
release RA, and exert neuroprotection against DA neuronal damage in MPTP mouse model of PD. More importantly, RA-NP
administration increases the expression levels of Pitx3 and Nurr1,
showing its supportive effect on the development and functional
maintenance of DA neurons in PD [69].
Although the specific mechanisms for the Nurr1 upregulating
effects of the above-mentioned compounds, natural products, and
biomaterials still remain poorly understood, those candidates have
a common feature to promote Nurr1 expression or functions, and
part of those candidates have been shown to exert potent

antiparkinsonian properties in clinic [64,68]. Further exploration
of those modulators should focus on identifying their direct
binding regions to Nurr1 and the Nurr1 upstream molecules. All
of these efforts may lead to a better understanding of their Nurr1
upregulating mechanisms and discovery of more potent Nurr1modulators for the treatment of PD.

Nurr1 Gene Therapy
Recent animal trials of Nurr1 gene therapy have shown a
gratifying progress. Two months after midbrain AAV-Nurr1/
Foxa2 injection, the DA neuron density and neurotrophic factor expression are significantly increased in MPTP-lesioned
mice model of PD together with a suppression of proinflammatory cytokine secretion [79]. Remarkably, this Nurr1/Foxa2mediated cytoprotective effect is observed even 1 year after
injection, suggesting that transfection of these genes is an
intriguing approach in PD therapy [79]. Although the outcome
of this trial seems exciting, the safety and feasibility of Nurr1
gene therapy still needs further verification. Firstly, the longterm effect of constitutive overexpression is not clear. Secondly, this therapeutic strategy has only been tested in toxininduced animal models (such as MPTP), but not in transgenic
PD models that may mimic a broader pathology of PD. Thirdly,
to achieve a better therapeutic outcome, the time window of
treatment and a controllable regulation of Nurr1 expression are
yet to be further explored.
Interestingly, it has been reported that GDNF which fails to
restore DA neuron loss is due to the toxicity of a-synuclein [32].
Considering that the overexpression of Nurr1 may protect DA
neurons against a-synuclein [32], a combinatory delivery of AAVNurr1 with GDNF or neurturin into the midbrain might improve
the outcome of the existing preclinical or clinical trials, and predict
a very attractive alternative therapy for PD [80].

Prospect of Nurr1-Based Therapy for PD
Nurr1 serves as a promising target for PD therapy by promoting
the survival or genesis of DA neurons [17]. As Nurr1 is encoded
by an immediate early gene, many modulators are implicated in
the Nurr1 pathway. A wide range of physiological signals, such as
prostaglandins, fatty acids, calcium, stress, growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, and even physical stimuli, such as membrane
depolarization, have been shown to induce Nurr1 expression
[81–86]. Besides, aging is a negative factor causing the decline of
Nurr1 expression [17], which in turn may reduce the compensatory protective capability of Nurr1 and increase the susceptibility
to develop PD. Restoring the impaired Nurr1 functions by Nurr1based therapies could provide tentative therapeutic strategies for
PD.
RXR, neurotropic factors, cAMP-responsive element-binding
protein (CREB), and Wnt/b-catenin pathway seem to play
positive roles in regulating Nurr1 expression [87–89]. Thus, we
propose that it may be an alternative way to facilitate Nurr1
functions through activating or increasing those modulators.
Inspiringly, RXR ligands, such as docosahexaenoic acid,
bexarotene, LG100268, and XCT0139508, have been demonstrated to protect DA neurons through interaction with Nurr1/
RXR heterodimers [87,90,91]. Although the biological functions
of bexarotene still remain to be defined, one recent study has
revealed that bexarotene might have the capacity to rescue the
disrupted GDNF signaling and regulate oxidative phosphorylation
and Nurr1-related genes [92]. In addition, animal tests have indicated that transplantation of GDNF-pretreated NSCs could dramatically enhance the expression of Nurr1 and TH [88]. Given
that GDNF has a poor blood–brain barrier penetrating feature,
GDNF inducers, such as telmisartan, calcitriol, rhus verniciflua
stokes, and cabergoline, can stimulate GDNF expression [93–98].
Moreover, CREB as an upstream regulator of Nurr1 may play an

important role in the process of most modulator-mediated Nurr1
upregulation, such as prostaglandin E2, thromboxane A2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and N-methyl-d-aspartate
[81,84,99,100]. Thus, CREB activators or other cAMP increasing
agents may also have the capacity to restore Nurr1 functions.
However, considering that CREB activates many signal pathways,
they in general may not be suitable to treat PD. Furthermore,
several studies have indicated that activation of Wnt/b-catenin
signaling pathway could induce the transcription of Nurr1
[101–103]. Given that Wnt/b-catenin pathway is involved in the
PD pathogenesis and exogenous Wnt1 could attenuate DA neuron loss in animal models of PD [104,105], we propose that activating Wnt/b-catenin pathway, such as GSK-3b antagonists, may
be effective in treating PD through the enhancement of Nurr1
expression [103]. Furthermore, Nurr1 activity can be affected by
several PD-related molecules, such as a-synuclein and microRNA132 (miR-132) [106,107]. Therefore, these molecules may be
potential therapeutic targets against PD. Indeed, it has been
reported that oligomer selective a-synuclein antibodies and prolyl
oligopeptidase inhibitors are effective in PD models through decelerating the accumulation of a-synuclein [108–110]. It is plausible
that Nurr1 may be involved in the antiparkinsonian effects of
those compounds. Moreover, several studies have described a
potential role of microRNAs in PD pathogenesis [111,112], and
miR-132 can directly inhibit Nurr1 expression [107]; thus,
miR-132 antagonist may be a potential modulator for PD treatment [107].
Nurr1-based cell transplantation is another therapy currently
under investigation. Several animal experiments have shown the
therapeutic potential of Nurr1-based cell transplantation, not only
in ameliorating the behavioral abnormality, but also restoring the
DA neuron deficits [113–118]. However, they have not been
tested in patients with PD concerning the biosafety and long-term
efficacy of cell transplantation in general [119].
It has been noticed that Nurr1 modulators may have other functions in addition to regulating Nurr1, and most of those compounds have not been evaluated in PD models yet, nor their side

effects have been systematically determined. Furthermore, Nurr1
also expresses in nonnervous system [120]. Therefore, the nonneurological effects of Nurr1 should not be neglected.

Conclusion
In summary, Nurr1-activating compounds, Nurr1 modulators,
and Nurr1-based gene therapy have shown their therapeutic
potential for PD treatment (as summarized in Figure 1). The pharmacological effects of Nurr1-based therapies against PD are proposed as follows: (1) increase the expression of DA-related genes;
(2) protect or repair DA neurons against neurotoxins; (3) inhibit
the microglia activation and suppress neuroinflammation. These
versatile functions make Nurr1 an attracting target for treating
PD. Further studies should focus on identifying small molecules,
which can effectively activate Nurr1 functions through either
direct binding to the specific regions of Nurr1 or modulating the
Nurr1-related signaling. Furthermore, the study of Nurr1 conditional knockout mouse models would be beneficial to better
understand the critical roles of Nurr1 in PD pathogenesis, and help
screen more specific Nurr1-activating or Nurr1-modulating compounds. Although it is still a long way to go for the clinical use in
patients with PD, the Nurr1-based therapies provide a very
promising outlook as the next-generation PD treatment.
