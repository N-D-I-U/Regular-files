Human neurons are functional over an entire lifetime, yet the mechanisms that preserve function and protect against
neurodegeneration during ageing are unknown. Here we show that induction of the repressor element 1-silencing transcription factor (REST; also known as neuron-restrictive silencer factor, NRSF) is a universal feature of normal ageing in
human cortical and hippocampal neurons. REST is lost, however, in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing and expression analysis show that REST represses genes that
promote cell death and Alzheimer’s disease pathology, and induces the expression of stress response genes. Moreover,
REST potently protects neurons from oxidative stress and amyloid b-protein toxicity, and conditional deletion of REST
in the mouse brain leads to age-related neurodegeneration. A functional orthologue of REST, Caenorhabditis elegans
SPR-4, also protects against oxidative stress and amyloid b-protein toxicity. During normal ageing, REST is induced in
part by cell non-autonomous Wnt signalling. However, in Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia and dementia
with Lewy bodies, REST is lost from the nucleus and appears in autophagosomes together with pathological misfolded
proteins. Finally, REST levels during ageing are closely correlated with cognitive preservation and longevity. Thus, the
activation state of REST may distinguish neuroprotection from neurodegeneration in the ageing brain.

The preservation of cognitive function during ageing has emerged as
one of the major medical challenges of the 21st century. A fundamental question is why some individuals age with their cognitive function
relatively intact whereas others decline and develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Early studies suggested that neuronal loss was an integral
feature of the ageing brain. With the advent of stereological neuronal
quantification, however, it became clear that neuronal cell number is
largely preserved in the neocortex and hippocampus of the ageing human
brain, declining only in the setting of neurodegenerative disease1–3.
Robust stress-response mechanisms must have evolved, therefore, to
preserve neurons and cognitive function across an entire lifespan4,5.
REST is a repressor of neuronal genes during embryonic development that is downregulated once terminal neuronal differentiation has
occurred6–8. Here we show that REST is induced in the ageing human
brain and regulates a network of genes that mediate cell death, stress
resistance and AD pathology. This gene network becomes dysregulated
at early stages of AD when REST is lost from the nucleus. Conditional
REST knockout mice and C. elegans models suggest that REST protects
neurons from age-related toxic insults. In ageing humans, elevated REST
levels are associated with preservation of cognitive function and increased
longevity, even in the presence of AD pathology. Hence, REST regulates a neuroprotective stress response that may be central to cognitive
preservation during ageing.

REST is induced in the ageing brain and declines in AD
Transcriptional profiling has demonstrated significant changes in the
expression of neuronal genes in the prefrontal cortex of ageing humans9,10.
Analysis of this data set using the Ingenuity Systems IPA platform indicates that the transcription factor most strongly predicted to be activated
in the ageing brain is REST (P 5 9 3 10210). Moreover, the 21-base-pair
canonical RE1 recognition motif for REST is highly enriched in the
age-downregulated gene set (P 5 3 3 1027) (Fig. 1a).

To explore the role of REST in the ageing brain, we measured REST
levels in extracts of prefrontal cortex (PFC) from young adult (20–35
years) and aged (73–106 years) individuals without AD. REST expression was significantly increased in the ageing human PFC at both the
messenger RNA and protein levels, as determined by quantitative PCR
with reverse transcription (qRT–PCR) and western blotting (Fig. 1b, c).
Full-length REST was markedly increased; the truncated splice variant
REST4 was a minor component, comprising 0.1–0.5% of REST mRNA.
Immunofluorescence microscopy using three different antibodies against
the amino- or carboxy-terminal domains of REST showed a striking
induction of REST in the nucleus of ageing neurons in the PFC and
hippocampus (Fig. 1d, e and Extended Data Fig. 1). Much lower levels
of REST were detected in microglial cells and astrocytes (data not shown).
REST antibody specificity was indicated by ablation of immunoreactivity
after antibody preabsorption with a REST blocking peptide, absence of
immunoreactivity with matched nonspecific IgG, and loss of immunoreactivity after shRNA-mediated REST knockdown in neural SHSY5Y cells (Extended Data Fig. 1b, c).
We then investigated whether induction of REST in ageing neurons
leads to increased REST–RE1 site binding. To assess REST targeting
specifically in neurons, we isolated neuronal nuclei from the PFC by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of NeuN-positive nuclei5
(Methods). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR analysis
showed a marked induction of REST binding to canonical RE1 motifs
in REST target genes in the aged PFC (Fig. 1f). These results indicate
that REST expression and function is increased in ageing neurons.
We next examined REST in ageing individuals with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) or AD. REST was almost absent from the nucleus
of cortical and hippocampal neurons in AD (Fig. 1d and Extended Data
Fig. 1a, d). Punctate cytoplasmic REST immunoreactivity was detected
in some AD neurons, but was not detectable in other neurons (Fig. 1d).
Loss of nuclear REST was confirmed by quantitative immunocytochemical

analysis of 77 cases of sporadic AD compared with 72 age-matched
cognitively intact controls, and confirmed by FACS analysis of neuronal
nuclei in a subset of cases (Fig. 1e). In 23 out of 24 cases of amnestic
MCI, nuclear REST levels were reduced relative to the mean of aged
controls (Fig. 1e). A survey of brain regions showed significantly reduced
nuclear REST levels in affected neuronal populations in AD, including
prefrontal cortical neurons, and neurons of the CA1, CA3 and CA4 subfields of the hippocampus (Extended Data Fig. 1a, d). In contrast, nuclear
REST was not reduced in neurons of the dentate gyrus and cerebellum, which are relatively unaffected in AD (Extended Data Fig. 1a, d).
Reduced REST levels in AD were confirmed by western blotting of prefrontal cortical grey matter samples, as well as isolated cortical nuclei
(Fig. 1c, upper and far right panels, respectively). Furthermore, ChIPPCR analysis of neuronal nuclei showed significantly reduced or absent
REST–RE1 site binding in AD relative to normal ageing controls (Figs 1f
and 2a). Thus, REST is induced during normal brain ageing, but is
markedly reduced in AD in vulnerable neuronal populations.

PUMA (also known as BBC3), the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ANT1 (also known as SLC25A4) and cytochrome C. REST targets related to the pathology of AD include the genes coding for gamma
secretase complex members presenilin 2 and presenilin enhancer 2 implicated in amyloid b-protein (Ab) generation, and CDK5R1 (also known
as p35), CDK5R2 (also known as p39), p38 MAP kinase (also known as
MAPK11, 12 and 14) and 14-3-3 zeta (also known as YWHAZ) implicated in tau (also known as MAPT) phosphorylation. REST repressed
the expression of these genes in SH-SY5Y cells (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b),
and strongly inhibited tau phosphorylation at the AT8 and PHF1 epitopes associated with AD (Extended Data Fig. 3c).
We next examined the regulation of these REST target genes in the
normal ageing brain and AD. To distinguish effects at different stages
of cognitive decline, we stratified the AD population for least severe
(AD1; Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score . 18) and most
severe (AD2; MMSE score , 8). REST targets related to cell death and
AD pathology showed reduced REST binding and elevated mRNA
expression at both stages of AD (Fig. 2a, b). REST target genes related
to neurotransmission, however, showed elevated mRNA expression
in early stage AD1, but reduced expression in later stage AD2 (Fig. 2b).
Regression analysis of protein levels showed that nuclear REST is inversely
correlated with levels of pro-apoptotic (BAX and DAXX) and AD-related
(presenilin 2) proteins in normal ageing and AD neurons (Fig. 2c, d).
This was also observed for REST targets associated with neurotransmission (SST and CALB1) during normal ageing and early stage AD1,
but not in late stage AD2 (Fig. 2c). The activation-associated histone
modification H3K9ac, which is typically reduced by REST, was globally downregulated in normal ageing PFC neurons (Fig. 2e) and was
inversely correlated with REST levels (Fig. 2c, d). In contrast, neuronal

REST represses genes involved in cell death and AD
To obtain greater insight into the functional consequences of REST
induction in the ageing brain, we explored REST targets by chromatin
immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) in the neural
cell line SH-SY5Y. REST binding to a subset of the identified target
genes was confirmed by ChIP-qPCR (Extended Data Fig. 2). REST ChIPseq sites were significantly enriched among age-regulated genes in human
PFC (P 5 1.65 3 10212), and were predominantly downregulated from
the third to the tenth decades of life (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Pathway
analysis of the ChIP-seq database showed a highly significant enrichment for genes in cell death pathways and genes that are associated
with AD/dementia (Extended Data Fig. 2b, c). Cell death genes include

H3K9ac increased significantly in early AD (Fig. 2e). Thus, loss of
nuclear REST in AD is associated with epigenetic derepression of potentially pathogenic genes.

REST is neuroprotective
Because REST represses pro-apoptotic genes, we explored a role in
neuroprotection by assessing vulnerability to oxidative stress and oligomeric Ab, stressors associated with brain ageing9 and AD11. Primary
cultures of mouse E16 cortical neurons were established from NestinCre:RESTlx/lx (REST cKO) and littermate control embryos. After 1–2 weeks
in culture, neuronal differentiation was comparable in REST-deficient
and control cultures. Upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide or oligomeric Ab42, REST-deficient neurons showed markedly increased degeneration and cell death relative to controls (Fig. 3a and Extended Data
Fig. 4a). REST-deficient neurons were rescued by lentiviral transduction of wild-type REST, leading to expression levels 2–2.5-fold that of
wild type (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 4a). In contrast, a REST mutant
that is deficient in nuclear translocation (DREST)12,13 was unable to rescue
(Fig. 3a, b). REST-deficient neurons showed increased expression of
pro-apoptotic genes in response to oxidative stress and oligomeric Ab
(Extended Data Fig. 4b). Thus, endogenous REST is neuroprotective.
REST-deficient mice showed a progressive age-related neurodegenerative phenotype. At 1 month of age, neuronal numbers in the cortex
and hippocampus of REST cKO mice were not significantly different from
controls. Neuronal degeneration and apoptosis appeared by 8 months
of age, as indicated by positive neuronal labelling for cleaved caspase-3
and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL; Fig. 3c, d). This

was accompanied by significant neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex
and hippocampus, and pronounced gliosis (Fig. 3c, d). These results
indicate that REST is essential for maintaining neuronal viability in the
ageing brain.
To confirm the findings on REST-deficient neurons, we assessed
vulnerability to oxidative stress after REST overexpression or short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown in neural SH-SY5Y cells. Cell death
induced by hydrogen peroxide was significantly reduced when REST
was overexpressed by 3- to 20-fold (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Higher
levels of REST overexpression increased cell death. REST knockdown
by lentiviral shRNA transduction significantly increased H2O2-induced
apoptosis in both SH-SY5Y cells and cultured human cortical neurons,
which was prevented by shRNA-resistant mouse REST (Extended Data
Fig. 4c, d). Furthermore, shRNA-mediated REST knockdown increased
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was prevented by the
antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) (Extended Data Fig. 4e, f). Moreover, REST knockdown increased oxidative DNA damage, which was
reduced by REST overexpression (Extended Data Fig. 4g). To examine
the relationship of REST expression to oxidative DNA damage in the
human brain, we double-labelled for REST and the oxidative DNA damage marker 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). Linear regression analysis showed
a significant inverse relationship between nuclear REST and 8-oxoG
levels in normal ageing neurons and in AD (Extended Data Fig. 4h).
Thus, REST expression during ageing may reduce oxidative damage.
The nematode Caenarhobditis elegans has served as a model system
of ageing and stress resistance4. Two multi-zinc finger transcription
factors in C. elegans structurally resemble mammalian REST (spr-3 and

spr-4)14,15, and another gene is closely homologous to CoREST (spr-1)16.
To test the role of these genes in oxidative stress resistance, we placed
adult worms on nematode growth medium supplemented with paraquat, a superoxide generator. C. elegans lines with mutations in spr-1,
spr-3 and spr-4 all showed significantly reduced survival relative to
wild-type controls (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 5a). The spr-4(by105)
mutant showed the greatest vulnerability. Furthermore, depletion of
spr-4 by RNA interference significantly reduced survival in wild-type
worms after treatment with paraquat (Extended Data Fig. 5b). SPR-4
was expressed predominantly in neurons (Extended Data Fig. 5c), and
was induced by oxidative stress (Extended Data Fig. 5d).
The increased sensitivity of the spr-4 mutant worms to oxidative
stress was significantly reduced by transgenic expression of either wildtype SPR-4 or human REST (Fig. 4a, b). To ascertain whether SPR-4
and REST directly modulate ROS levels, worms were labelled with the
fluorescent ROS indicator 29,79-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
(DCFDA). spr-4(by105) mutants treated with paraquat showed significantly elevated ROS levels relative to wild-type, which was reduced
by transgenic expression of either wild-type SPR-4 or human REST
(Fig. 4c, d). To determine whether REST can substitute for SPR-4 as a
transcriptional repressor, we assessed the expression of the presenilin
gene hop-1, which is repressed by SPR-4. The expression of hop-1 was
elevated in adult spr-4 mutants relative to wild-type worms, and was
repressed by both wild-type SPR-4 and human REST (Extended Data

SPR-4 also modulated the neurotoxicity of Ab in a C. elegans line
that expresses Ab42 in glutamatergic neurons and undergoes agedependent neuronal loss17. When this Ab-expressing line was crossed
with the spr-4(by105) mutant, the resulting line expressed Ab42 in an
spr-4 loss-of-function background and showed significantly accelerated neurodegeneration (Fig. 4e). Thus, SPR-4 protects against both
oxidative stress and Ab toxicity, consistent with a general role in stress
resistance.

Induction of REST by stress and Wnt signalling
To determine whether REST might be induced by oxidative and other
forms of stress in the ageing brain, we subjected primary human cortical neuronal cultures to a variety of stressors. Incubation with redoxactive iron (Fe12), hydrogen peroxide, the glutathione synthesis inhibitor
buthionine sulphoxide (BSO), or Ab42-induced REST mRNA and protein and increased REST–RE1 site binding (Extended Data Fig. 6a–f).
To determine whether secreted factors might contribute to REST induction, cortical neurons were incubated with H2O2 followed by removal

Autophagy of REST in neurodegenerative disorders

of H2O2 and generation of conditioned medium. Addition of stressrelated conditioned medium to naive neuronal cultures resulted in a
marked induction of REST mRNA expression (Extended Data Fig. 6g).
Thus, a variety of stressors induce REST expression, which is mediated
at least in part through cell non-autonomous signalling.
To explore the role of cell non-autonomous signalling in the ageing
brain, we generated extracts of human PFC from young adult and
aged samples and assessed their effects on SH-SY5Y cells. REST was
robustly induced by extracts of aged human cortex, but minimally by
extracts of young adult cortex (Extended Data Fig. 6h). Furthermore,
extracts of AD cortex showed reduced REST-inducing activity relative
to age-matched controls (Extended Data Fig. 6h). Because REST has
been identified as a target of canonical Wnt-b-catenin signalling18, we
examined the role of this cell non-autonomous signalling pathway.
Extracts of aged cortex and conditioned medium from stressed cells
treated with H2O2, tunicamycin or wortmannin induced b-catenin in
parallel with REST (Extended Data Figs 6h and 7a, b). Induction of
REST and b-catenin was partially inhibited by the Wnt signalling antagonist Dickkopf (Extended Data Fig. 7a, b). REST was also induced by
addition of purified Wnt-3a and Wnt-7a. Moreover, the GSK3-b inhibitors lithium chloride and Chiron 99021 that activate Wnt signalling
induced REST, increased REST–RE1 site binding, and augmented nuclear
translocation (Extended Data Fig. 7c–f). To assess Wnt signalling in
the human brain, we measured nuclear b-catenin levels in the PFC of
young adult and aged cases. Nuclear b-catenin was significantly elevated in ageing PFC neurons and colocalized with REST (Extended
Data Fig. 7g, h). These results indicate that Wnt-b-catenin signalling
may contribute to the induction of REST in the ageing brain.

In AD, loss of REST from the nucleus was often accompanied by localization to punctate cytoplasmic structures that were labelled with the
autophagosome markers LC3, ATG7 and ATG12, but not the lysosomal
markers LAMP1 and LAMP2 (Extended Data Fig. 8a). To determine if
autophagy could alter the nuclear:cytoplasmic distribution of REST,
autophagy was activated in SH-SY5Y cells by serum deprivation. This
resulted in significantly reduced nuclear REST, which was reversed by
treatment with 3-methyladenine or bafilomycin, both inhibitors of autophagy (Extended Data Fig. 8b, c). Because activation of autophagy is characteristic of many age-related neurodegenerative disorders, we asked
whether REST is also depleted in other dementing diseases. Examination of cortical sections from patients with frontotemporal dementia
(FTD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) showed marked depletion
of nuclear REST (Fig. 5a).
Induction of autophagy in neurodegenerative disorders has been
associated with pathogenic misfolded proteins such as Ab (ref. 19). In
AD, many cortical and hippocampal neurons showed a notable colocalization of REST with Ab in LC3-positive autophagosomes (Fig. 5b).
In contrast, REST did not colocalize with Ab in amyloid plaques. Phosphorylated tau and TDP-43 have been implicated as abnormally folded
pathogenic proteins in FTD, whereas a-synuclein has been implicated
in DLB. Every case (8) of tau-positive FTD examined showed colocalization of REST with phosphorylated tau ( PHF1 epitope) in LC3-positive
autophagosomes (Fig. 5b). Similarly, every case (6) of TDP-43-positive
FTD showed colocalization of REST with TDP-43 and LC3 (Fig. 5b).
All ten cases of DLB examined showed partial colocalization of REST
with a-synuclein in autophagosomes (Fig. 5b). Thus, autophagy of REST,

together with pathogenic misfolded proteins, may reduce nuclear translocation in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

REST, cognitive preservation and longevity
A central question is whether loss of REST in AD contributes to cognitive decline. We explored this question by using measures of cognitive function derived from neuropsychiatric assessments performed
longitudinally in the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory
and Ageing Project (Methods). Linear regression analysis showed that
nuclear REST levels in prefrontal cortical neurons are positively correlated with a measure of global cognition, and separate measures of
episodic, semantic and working memory with high levels of statistical
significance (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig. 9a). Similar results were
obtained in pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region. For
both brain regions, REST levels were most robustly correlated with
episodic memory, which typically declines early in the course of AD. Elevated REST levels also predicted reduced AD neuropathology (Fig. 6b
and Extended Data Fig. 9b).
We then asked if elevated REST levels might confer resistance to AD
pathology. Cases with National Institutes on Aging and Reagan Institute
(NIA-Reagan) and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s
disease (CERAD) scores indicative of pathological AD, but with mild
or no cognitive impairment, were compared to cases with pathological
AD together with severe cognitive impairment. Nuclear REST levels
were significantly elevated in cognitively preserved cases relative to cognitively impaired cases, despite the fact that both groups met pathological criteria for AD (Fig. 6c). Thus, elevated REST levels are associated

with cognitive preservation in individuals who meet pathological criteria for AD.
Because REST is associated with stress resistance and preservation
of cognitive function, we explored the relationship to human lifespan.
Nuclear REST levels in PFC neurons showed a significant positive correlation with longevity (R 5 0.53; P , 1024) (Fig. 6d). This relationship
remained significant after multivariate adjustment for cognitive test scores
and indices of neuropathology. Furthermore, the expression of REST
target genes showed a highly significant inverse correlation with longevity (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Examination of the neuroanatomical
distribution of REST in individuals with extreme longevity showed
marked induction in neurons of the PFC and hippocampus, but not in
the Purkinje or granule cell neurons of the cerebellum (Extended Data
Fig. 10a). Thus, REST expression in specific neuronal populations correlates with longevity.
We then asked if REST regulates genes that have been implicated in
stress resistance and the ageing process. In addition to repressing cell
death genes, REST also promoted expression of the anti-apoptotic gene
BCL2, the antioxidants catalase and SOD1, and the FOXO transcription factor FOXO1 (Extended Data Figs 3a and 10b). As FOXO1 has
been implicated in oxidative stress resistance20 and human longevity21,
we assessed its regulation by REST at the protein level. REST knockdown by shRNA transduction in SH-SY5Y cells almost completely abolished FOXO1 expression, which was reversed by an shRNA-resistant
mouse REST vector (Extended Data Fig. 10c). Thus, REST may broadly
confer stress resistance during ageing.

Discussion
We have demonstrated a striking induction of the developmental transcriptional repressor REST in specific neuronal populations of the ageing
human brain together with epigenetic repression of REST target genes.
REST has been investigated extensively as a repressor of neuronal genes
during embryonic development, a function that persists in adult nonneuronal cells22. Our findings suggest that REST additionally plays a
role as a neuroprotective modulator, in part by repressing genes that
promote cell death and the pathology of AD. Moreover, REST increases
the expression of FOXO transcription factors that mediate oxidative
stress resistance20, as well as the antioxidant enzymes catalase and SOD1,
possibly through indirect mechanisms such as repression of micro RNAs.
Consistent with these findings, REST confers oxidative stress resistance
and protects against toxic insults associated with AD, including Ab
oligomers and tau phosphorylation. Furthermore, REST appears to be
essential for maintaining neuronal viability in the normal ageing cortex
and hippocampus. This protective function is conserved in C.elegans.
Previous ChIP-SACO23 and ChIP-chip24 studies also identified REST
target genes involved in cell death. In addition, a recent study suggests
that REST protects against the toxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a model of Parkinson’s disease25. Thus,
REST may coordinate a stress response that is broadly neuroprotective
in the ageing brain.
REST dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of a number
of different neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to AD, REST was
also significantly depleted in frontotemporal dementia and dementia
with Lewy bodies. In each of these disorders, REST was lost from the
nucleus and appeared in autophagosomes together with pathological
misfolded proteins, including Ab, phosphorylated tau, TDP-43 and asynuclein. This may represent a common pathogenic mechanism that
links altered proteostasis to aberrant gene expression.
Recent studies suggest that epigenetic regulation of chromatin may
modulate the cognitive outcome of a variety of neuropathological states26–28.
It is intriguing that ageing individuals who harbour substantial AD
pathology do not appear to progress to dementia when neuronal REST
levels are high. This raises the possibility that structural pathology, such as
Ab deposition and neurofibrillary tangles, may not be sufficient to cause
dementia. Rather, failure of the brain’s stress response system may also
be necessary, suggesting new possibilities for therapeutic intervention.

ARTICLE RESEARCH
METHODS
Brain sample procurement. Post-mortem human brain material was procured
in accordance with institutional guidelines governed by approved protocols. Tissue
samples were procured from the Rush University Medical Center, the University of
Maryland, Duke University, the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and the Massachusetts General Hospital. Tissue samples from Rush University Medical Center
were derived from participants in the Religious Order Study (ROS) and Rush
Memory and Ageing Project (MAP) at the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center, which
are longitudinal, clinical-pathological studies of ageing, cognitive decline and AD30,31.
Study participants agreed to comprehensive annual clinical and neuropsychological evaluation and brain donation at death. Informed consent was obtained and
the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Rush University
Medical Centre.
Cognitive function tests and neuropathology. Measures of cognitive function
were derived from neuropsychiatric assessments performed longitudinally in the
Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Ageing Project (MAP). This
population includes individuals across the cognitive spectrum, ranging from normal to AD. The last cognitive test scores obtained during life were related to nuclear
REST levels in post-mortem prefrontal cortical brain samples by quantitative immunocytochemistry (111 cases, Fig. 6a) and FACS analysis of isolated neuronal nuclei
(37 additional cases, Extended Data Fig. 9a). Nineteen cognitive function tests
were employed in the present study, including a summary score of all 19 tests used
as a measure of global cognition, and separate measures of episodic, semantic and
working memory, and perceptual speed. The follow-up rate exceeds 95% and the
autopsy rate exceeds 90%.
Autopsy cases in the Religious Orders and MAP studies underwent a uniform
structured neuropathological evaluation of AD, including assignment of Braak
(measure of number and distribution of neurofibrillary tangles), CERAD (Ab
plaque pathology), and NIA-Reagan (composite measure of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques) scores. The clinical diagnoses of AD and MCI have
been described in detail and pathological confirmation of AD approaches 90%32–34.
Frozen brain tissue specimens used in this study were from the prefrontal cortical
grey matter (Brodmann area 9, 10) and were snap-frozen and stored at 2140 uC.
Paraffin-embedded brain samples were also obtained from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. These samples included young
adult cases without neurological abnormalities, aged subjects that did not carry a
diagnosis of AD or another neurodegenerative disease and showed neuropathological findings within the normal range for age, and cases of AD, FTD and DLB
with clinical histories of these disorders and subsequent pathological confirmation. A total of 364 brain specimens with an age range from 19–106 years were
used for molecular and histopathological analyses. The characteristics of these
cases are provided in Supplementary Table 1.
Microarray analysis. Gene expression profiling using microarrays has been described
previously35. Human brain samples with tissue pH , 6.5 or post-mortem interval
(PMI) . 20 h were excluded. Prefrontal cortical samples with acceptable parameters
of RNA quality were hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133plus 2.0 arrays,
which were then scanned and expression data extracted using Affymetrix Microarray Suite Software. The Probe-level Linear Model (PLM) platform was used for
analysis of microarray data36. A subset of the data was additionally analysed using
RMA or dCHIP platforms yielding similar results. Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software37 was used for 2-group comparisons of young adult versus
aged with the following criteria for identifying age-related expression changes: 1,000
permutations and median false discovery rate (FDR) # 0.01. Age-regulated genes
that overlap with RE1-containing genes29 were visualized by hierarchical clustering
using dChip software38 (Fig. 1a). The display range used was 1.5 (a value greater
than 1.5 standard deviations above the mean is pure red, below is pure blue, and
equal to the mean is white.
Real time RT–PCR and PCR. Primers were designed for 90–300-base-pair (bp)
segments to span exon boundaries if possible. PCR or real-time PCR were run for
30–40 cycles (Supplementary Table 2). The purity of both PCR and RT–PCR
products were determined by single peak melting curves, and further confirmed
by agarose gel electrophoresis. To extract RNA, the Cells-to-cDNA II Kit was
used for cells, and TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used for tissue samples. All RNAs were
DNase treated. A standard curve for each primer pair was generated by serial dilution of a pool of titrated RNA or DNA. Beta-actin or GAPDH were used as internal
controls. Positive control primers for the REST ChIP assay, SYN- RE1 primers,
were from Millipore (Cat#17-641), and the C-terminal truncated splice variant,
REST4 primers: RES4-F: 59-GTGAGCGAGTATCACTGGAGG-39, REST4-R: 59CCATCTAGATCACACTCTGAATG-39 have been reported previously39. Other
primers used in this study were designed using Primer3.0, and are listed in Supplementary Table 2.
Western blotting. Tissues were homogenized, whereas cells were directly lysed
using RIPA-DOC buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors

(Complete and Phosphostop, Roche). A sonication step was performed before
centrifugation at 10,200g for 10 min at 4 uC. The supernatant was removed and
the protein concentration determined (Bio-Rad protein assay). SDS sample buffer
containing beta-mercaptoethanol was added and 20 mg protein was loaded per
lane and resolved by 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad). Western
blots were quantified by densitometry using the ImageJ software. The antibodies
used for this study are described in Supplementary Table 3.
Immunohistochemical analysis of human brain. Antibodies used in this study
are described in Supplementary Table 3, The following REST-specific antibodies
were used for immunolabelling studies: a rabbit polyclonal IgG recognizing a
region between residues 1,050 and the C terminus (residue 1,097) of REST (Bethyl
laboratories, IHC-00141), a rabbit polyclonal IgG recognizing a region between
residues 801 and the C terminus (residue 1,097) of REST (Millipore, 07-579), a
goat polyclonal IgG recognizing an internal region of REST (Santa Cruz, sc-15118),
and (4) rabbit monoclonal IgG recognizing a region near the N terminus of REST
(Abcam, ab28018).
Immunohistochemical/immunofluorescence analysis using paraffin-embedded
brain sections was performed in the following regions: the prefrontal cortex (Broadmann areas 9, 10 and 47, the hippocampal formation, including the CA1, CA3, CA4
and DG sectors, and the cerebellum. Analysis of REST expression by immunohistochemistry using paraffin-embedded sections obtained from the various sources
indicated above led to very similar conclusions.
Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were first deparaffinized in xylene, then rehydrated with decreasing concentrations of ethanol and placed in water. Sections
then underwent antigen retrieval using either citrate buffer (Vectorlabs, USA) or
the Diva decloaker (BioCare, USA). For diaminobenzidine (DAB) labelling, sections were additionally treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. They were
then washed and blocked with 3% BSA, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room
temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA, 0.1% Triton in PBS. Following overnight incubations, sections were washed three times with PBS. Secondary
antibodies, diluted in 2% BSA, 0.1% Triton in PBS were either biotin-coupled (1:200,
Vector Labs, USA) or coupled to Alexa fluorophores (1:300, Invitrogen). For DAB
labelling, sections were additionally incubated with a pre-formed biotin-avidinhorseradish peroxidase complex (1:100, VectorLabs). For immunofluorescence
labelling, sections were also incubated with 1% Sudan Black in 70% ethanol, for
10 min, to suppress lipofuscin autofluorescence. Following washes in PBS, sections were mounted and imaged using confocal or bright field microscopy. To
quantify immunofluorescence or DAB labelling, images were randomly acquired
in selected brain regions. Antigen-expressing areas within each neuron and in
cellular compartments (such as the nucleus) were selected using the MetaMorph
image analysis system and the average signal intensity measured. Values were corrected by subtracting the average slide background intensity (measured outside of
cells). Between 50 and 100 neurons were analysed for each case. The investigator
was blinded to sample origin or diagnosis.
For linear regression analysis of the relationship between nuclear REST and the
levels of proteins encoded by REST targets (BAX, DAXX, PSEN2, calbindin and
somatostatin) (Fig. 2c, d); the activating histone mark H3K9Ac (Fig. 2c, d), or
oxidative DNA damage (8-oxoguanine) (Extended Data Fig. 4h), we performed
double-label immunofluorescence for REST (Bethyl antibody) and each individual
protein or marker. Multiple 340 pictures were acquired (at various locations)
within the prefrontal cortex displaying pyramidal neurons using an Olympus Fluoview Confocal Microscope. For cases displaying a majority of pyramidal neurons
with very high (or very low) nuclear REST levels, fields were also included that
displayed lower (or higher, respectively) REST levels, to test for potential correlations between REST and each target. Antigen-expressing areas within each neuron
(such as the nucleus or the cytoplasm) were selected using the MetaMorph image
analysis system and the average signal intensity was measured. Values were corrected by subtracting the average slide background intensity (measured outside of
cells). Between 25 and 75 pyramidal neurons were quantified for each case for
linear regression.
Image acquisition. Images were acquired using an Olympus Fluoview confocal
microscope, or using a bright field microscope coupled to a CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). No image processing was performed on the acquired
images, with the exception of Fig. 3c (the haematoxylin and eosin image) and
Fig. 5b (the DAPI channel in DLB and FTD panels), which were contrasted to
allow better visualization of cell nuclei.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Antibodies against nuclear proteins,
as well as isotype-matched control IgGs, were pre-conjugated to Allophycocyanin
(APC) using lightning-link APC conjugation kit (Innova Biosciences). The monoclonal antibody against NeuN coupled to Alexa-Fluor 488 (Millipore, MAB 477X)
was used for neuron-specific labelling. The antibodies and reagents used in this
study are listed in Supplementary Table 3. Approximately 1–2 mg of antibody was
added to 106 nuclei per ml and incubated at 4 uC for 12 h with gentle rocking in the

dark. Labelled nuclei were washed twice by centrifugation and filtered to remove
clumps before performing FACS. The DNA binding dyes DAPI or propidium iodide
were used for gating of nuclei. Aggregate discrimination was achieved based on the
height, area and width parameters for front scattering (FSC) and side scattering
(SSC). The purity and identity of isolated neuronal nuclei was further confirmed by
microscopy and epigenetic analysis. For each antibody, the geometric mean value
of single-nuclei events that is above the matched nonspecific IgG control was determined. An average of 10,000 events was acquired for FACS analysis. For ChIP
assays, ,106 FACS-sorted neuronal nuclei were collected by centrifugation.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and nuclear isolation. The ChIP assay
protocol has been described previously40. Cells or tissue homogenates were crosslinked using 1% formaldehyde (37% solution, sigma) at room temperature for
10 min. Then the reaction was then stopped by adding glycine (1.25 M, 103) and
washed twice by centrifugation. The cell pellet was dissolved in SDS lysis buffer
(1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). The genomic DNA was
sheared into 300–1,000bp by sonication (Bioruptor), followed by centrifugation.
The supernatant was removed, diluted with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01%SDS, 1.1%
Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 167 mM NaCl, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and precleared with Protein A Sepharose beads (Invitrogen) before adding antibodyconjugated beads. 5% of the sheared DNA was used as input control. After incubation
with rocking at 4 uC for 12 h, chromatin bound beads were washed twice with low
salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS.1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), once with high salt wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100,
2 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), once with LiCl wash buffer
(0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.1), and twice with TE buffer (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1). The
beads were then incubated with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1M NaHCO3), followed
by de-cross-linking at 65 uC for 5 h. The eluted preparation was then treated with
RNase A and proteinase K followed by isolation of DNA using the Qiagen PCR
purification kit. For ChIP-PCR (Figs 1f, 2a and Extended Data Figs 2d, 6f), primers
were directed to binding sites identified by ChIP-seq analysis of SH-SY5Y cells.
The isolation of nuclei from human brain tissue was performed using a protocol
adapted from previously described methods41,42. Briefly, 0.5 g of frozen tissue was
Dounce-homogenized in 10 ml of NF1 hypotonic buffer (0.4% Triton X100, 0.3 M
Sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, supplemented with Complete protease inhibitors from Roche) on ice, incubated for
30 min, and then Dounce-homogenized with 30 additional strokes. The homogenates were then centrifuged in a swinging-bucket rotor at 180g for 10 min at 4 uC.
The pellet was washed once with rocking at 4 uC for 0.5 h, and then resuspended in
NF1 buffer. Crude nuclei were carefully layered onto a cushion of 5 ml sucrose solution (1.2 M (40%) sucrose, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0),
and centrifuged at 4,700g for 30 min at 4 uC. The isolated nuclear preparation was
resuspended in 1 ml NF2 buffer (0.1 M sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1%
BSA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), filtered with a 40 mm strainer (BD Falcon), and the
number of nuclei was quantified after DAPI labelling, and then diluted to a concentration of 106 nuclei per ml. For FACS-ChIP assays, 1 g of brain tissue was
Dounce-homogenized in 10 ml PBS with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche)
using pestle A, fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and
then washed twice with NF1 buffer by centrifugation and gentle resuspension. The
preparation was then treated as described above for brain tissue samples that did
not undergo fixation.
ChIP sequencing. For ChIP-seq analysis, 10 3 15 cm2 dishes of SH-SY5Y cells at
80% confluence were incubated in the absence or presence of 5 mM LiCl (to induce
REST expression) in SH-SY5Y cell culture medium (see ‘Cell cultures’ below) for
12 h. ChIP was performed as described above, except that genomic DNA was sheared
to 150–300 bp fragments, confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. For normalization and analysis of enrichment, input controls for each sample were sequenced.
ChIP-DNA (2 ng) was used for library preparation followed by deep sequencing at
the High Throughput Sequencing Facility of the University of North Carolina.
Approximately 30 million ChIP-seq reads with read length of 36 were aligned to
the hg18 genome assembly using ELAND with the default parameters. Sequence
reads within REST binding sites were identified from ChIP-seq data using the latest
version of MACS43 algorithm (1.4) with the default parameters. Genes that harbour
REST binding sites within 10 kb of transcription start sites with at least threefold
enrichment relative to the input control, statistical q value , 0.01 and P value ,
1025 were considered as putative REST targets. Binding sites showed the canonical
RE1 motif44, as well as previously identified non-canonical REST-binding motifs45,46
(Supplementary Table 4a, b). Fisher’s exact test was used to assess the statistical
significance of the overlap between REST targets and genes that are age-regulated
in the human prefrontal cortex.
REST-deficient mice. Animal housing and experimental procedures were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Harvard Medical School.
Mice carrying floxed alleles of REST flanking exon 2 were described previously47.

These mice were crossed to Nestin-Cre transgenic mice (Jackson laboratory; strain
No. 003771) to achieve REST conditional inactivation in the nervous system. The
Nes-Cre transgene is in the C57BL/6J background, and the RESTlx/lx alleles were in
a hybrid C57BL/6J and 129Sv/Ev background. The resulting Nestin-Cre:RESTlx/lx
conditional knockout mice (hybrid C57BL/6J and 129Sv/Ev background), referred
to as REST cKO, were born at expected Mendelian ratios, were viable and fertile,
and did not display any visible alterations. The control group included RESTlx/lx
and Nes-Cre mice. Mouse genotyping by PCR was performed using the following
primers to amplify a region in the REST gene flanking exon 2: re08 (59-CATGCG
AGTACTGCCATACCCAAC-39), re09 (59-GTGATGGGGCAGTCTTCTGGAG
G-39), and re11 (59-GGGCACACCTTTAATCCTAGCTTC-39); this allowed the
identification of WT (220 bp), floxed (264 bp) or recombined (375 bp) REST alleles47.
The experimental groups included both male and female mice. The REST cKO and
REST1/1 control groups were composed of littermate mice (same genetic background). Mice were identified by eartag numbers, and were randomly selected for
histological processing (perfusion, brain dissection, etc.). The investigator was
blind to age and genotype.
Immunohistochemical and histological analysis of mouse brain. Mice were
anesthetized with isoflurane and carbon dioxide and then perfused with cold PBS
buffer for 20 min. Brains were rapidly removed and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. They were then processed for paraffin embedding, according to
standard procedures. TUNEL labelling was performed following manufacturer’s
instructions. For quantification of neuronal density, randomly selected areas within
the hippocampus or the cortex, and at various depths within these structures, were
imaged at 320 magnification. The number of cells (using either haematoxylin and
eosin or NeuN labelling) was determined using the MetaMorph image analysis
software and was then divided by the area occupied by these cells. The investigator
was blind to the genotype.
Cell culture. REST cKO embryos and littermate controls were used to establish
primary cortical and hippocampal cultures as described previously48. Each embryo
was individually genotyped by PCR. Moreover, PCR analysis of DNA isolated from
primary E16 embryonic neurons confirmed the excision of the REST floxed allele
by Cre, in contrast to DNA derived from embryo tails. qRT–PCR was performed
on the corresponding neuronal cultures or brain samples for genotype confirmation (RT–PCR: forward primer, 59-CTTTGTCCTTACTCAAGCTCTC-39 reverse
primer, 59-TTCCTGAGACTCGTTTTCAGCC-39; product size is 2,034 bp).
Embryonic cultures from E16 fetuses were plated on either coverslips or culture
dishes that were pre-coated with both poly-D-lysine (Beckton-Dickinson) and
laminin, and maintained in serum-free neurobasal medium containing B27 supplements and GlutaMAX. Hippocampal cultures (7 days in vitro (DIV)) or cortical
cultures (14 DIV) were treated with either oligomeric Ab42 for 24 h or H2O2 for
5 h. Oligomeric Ab was prepared as described previously49 and confirmed by SDS
gel electrophoresis with and without boiling. Neuronal differentiation was comparable in REST cKO and control cultures after 1–2 weeks, as indicated by immunofluorescence labelling with antibody Tuj1 (MAB1637, Millipore), and western
blotting for the neuronal differentiation marker NeuN (MAB377, Millipore).
The SH-SY5Y neural cell line was maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM) with 4.5 mg l21 D-glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium
pyruvate, 100 U ml21 penicillin, 100 mg ml21 streptomycin (all from Invitrogen),
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To induce autophagy, SH-SY5Y cells
were maintained in serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) for 24 h, and
then treated with inhibitors (5 mM 3-methyladenine or 150 nM bafilomycin) or
maintained in Opti-MEM without inhibitors for an additional 16 h before fixation
and imaging. The cells did not show morphological changes or evidence of reduced
viability under these conditions. Human cortical neuronal cultures (HCNC) were
established as previously described50, and were maintained in neurobasal media
with 2 mM L-glutamine and B27 supplements (Invitrogen). Mature HCNCs (14
DIV) were used for experiments. B27 supplements without added antioxidants
were used for oxidative stress-related experiments.
Assessment of cell viability and apoptosis. Cell viability was assessed using a
chromogenic assay that involves the biological reduction by viable cells of the tetrazolium compound 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS). Cells were seeded in either 48- or 96well plates and treated at 80% confluence. After adding MTS to culture medium
and incubating for 2 h in the dark at 37 uC, absorbance was measured at 490 nm
against a blank control with a plate reader. For detection of apoptotic cells, cells
were incubated with annexin V, allophycocyanin conjugate (APC Annexin V,
Invitrogen) for 15 min in 13 binding buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.14 M
NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2). Cells were washed twice by centrifugation and resuspension
and analysed immediately by FACS.
Analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS levels were measured using the
cell-permeable fluorescent indicator CellROX Deep Red (C10422, Invitrogen) with
detection by FACS. SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in the absence or presence of

hydrogen peroxide for 1 h, which was removed followed by centrifugation and
resuspension twice. The cells were then incubated with the CellROX Deep Red
reagent for 30 min at 37 uC, placed on ice and then analysed by FACS.
Immunocytochemical analysis of cultured cells. Cells plated on laminin/polylysine-coated coverslips were fixed by incubation with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde
in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, followed by three washes in PBS, and then
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature.
After 3 additional washes in PBS, cells were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS
for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted to the appropriate concentration using 10% goat serum, and incubated overnight at 4 uC. Cells were then
washed 3 times in 1% goat serum in PBS for 10 min before adding fluorophoreconjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. Fluorophore labelled
cells were then washed in 1% goat serum in PBS for 3310 min, and then mounted
using Prolong Gold mounting medium with DAPI and anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen).
To score endogenous nuclear REST in SH-SY5Ycells, Pearson correlations between
DAPI and REST were generated from 200–300 cells from multiple coverslips using
confocal analysis software. A threshold of R . 0.6 was used to indicate positive
nuclear localization.
Single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 100 mM
hydrogen peroxide for 20 min at 4 uC and then suspended in PBS containing 1 mM
EDTA on ice. The alkaline comet assay was then performed using the CometAssay
HT kit (Trevigen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The percentage of
DNA in the comet tail was measured in 114–132 cells for each sample using CometScore image analysis software (TriTek).
Generation of cell-conditioned medium and cortical extracts. For conditioned
medium transfer experiments (Extended Data Figs 6g, h and 7a, b), cells were
incubated with stress-inducing agents, followed by removal of the medium and 2
changes of fresh medium before the final addition of conditioning medium. After
a 6 h incubation period, the medium was removed and centrifuged twice to remove
suspended cells or debris. The medium was then transferred to a new well containing naive cells. After a 10-h incubation period, the treated cells were collected and
analysed. To generate extracts of human prefrontal cortex, ,200 mg cortical grey
matter tissue samples were gently homogenized on ice using a Dounce A pestle in
2 ml of cell culture medium supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete,
Roche). Brain extracts were cleared by sequential centrifugation and resuspension
(23 110g, 23 2,700g and 20,000g, each for 10 min at 4 uC). The tissue extracts were
normalized to the DNA concentration of the starting material, and added to cultured SH-SY5Y cells at 25% of total medium volume.
Generation of recombinant lentiviruses. Viral particles were generated in HEK293T
cells by co-transfection of transfer vectors, packaging plasmid (pRSV-REV and
pMDLg) and envelope plasmid (pCMV-VSVG) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured for 2 days and the medium was collected, centrifuged
at 180g for 5 min, and passed through a 0.45 mm low protein binding filter (VWR).
Viruses were then centrifuged at 110,000g for 2 h at 4 uC (Beckman SW28) and
then resuspended in 200 ml of PBS. Viruses were titred by infecting SH-SY5Y cells
at serial dilution. The percentage of transduced cells, identified by enhanced green
fluorescent protein (EGFP) fluorescence, was measured by flow cytometry 72 h
post-infection. Cells that express REST-IRS-GFP were sorted into low, middle and
high expression populations based on GFP intensity, and the corresponding REST
levels were determined by qRT–PCR.
C. elegans strains. The N2 Bristol strain was used as the wild-type background for
these studies. C. elegans strains were cultured at 20 uC under standard conditions51.
The following mutations and chromosome rearrangements were used: LGI: spr4(by105)15, spr-4(tm465) (this study), daf-16(mu86)52, hT2[bli-4(e937) qIs48]
(I;III); LGII: sod-1(tm776)53; LGV: spr-1(ok2144); and LGX: spr-3(ok2525) (this
study). All strains, except for spr-4(tm465), were provided by the Caenorhabditis
Genetics Center (CGC), which is funded by the NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (P40 OD010440). Strains obtained from external sources which had
been outcrossed previously were outcrossed to our N2 strains twice. Worms which
had not been outcrossed previously were outcrossed six times.
C. elegans RNAi. RNAi feeding experiments were performed at 20 uC. HT115
bacterial clones from a C. elegans RNAi feeding library (Geneservice) were used
for spr-4 (C09H6.1), sod-1 (C15F1.7), and sod-2 (F10D11.1). Control RNAi was
performed by feeding HT115 bacteria carrying the empty pL440 vector. Clones
were sequence validated and knockdown was confirmed by semiquantitative
RT–PCR. The TU3270 (uIs57 [Punc-119::sid-11 Punc-119::YFP1Pmec-6::mec-6])
strain was also used to assess neuronal loss-of-function54.
C. elegans microinjection and transgenic strains. Transgenic C. elegans lines
were generated by microinjecting the relevant constructs into the gonads of the
indicated strains. Prab-3::mCherry (pGH8, Addgene: 19359) was used as a coinjection marker labelling neurons. Three independent lines that demonstrated
reliable transmission of the marker were propagated as described above for each
experiment. Transgene expression was verified by qRT–PCR (see below), using

primers that spanned exon junctions for spr-4 or human REST, normalized for
possible DNA carryover by using two pairs of primers to the ampicillin resistance
gene (present in all plasmids) and a specific site in pD152.79 (see table below for
primer sequences). The spr-4 transgene was overexpressed by 18-24-fold relative
to endogenous spr-4 expression in wild-type worms. The human REST transgene
was expressed at levels comparable to the cdc-42 housekeeping gene.
To analyse RNA from transgenic lines, 100 Prab-3::mCherry positive worms
(24 h post-L4) of each strain (including controls) were placed into 1.5 ml M9 buffer.
Worms were washed once in M9, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 200 ml
TRIzol, vortexed for 2 min and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Worms were then
freeze-cracked by thawing in a 37 uC water bath and re-freezing in liquid nitrogen.
This was repeated 2 more times. After the final thaw, 100 ml of TRIzol was added
and the tubes were maintained at room temperature for 5 min. RNA was then
extracted with 140 ml of chloroform, precipitated with an equal volume of 70% ethanol and transferred to an RNeasy spin column (Qiagen) and purified. Quantitative RT–PCR was performed directly from isolated RNA, using 1 ng of RNA
and the Qiagen One Step qPCR mix. All reactions were performed in triplicate.
Analysis of Ab toxicity in C. elegans. The UA198 Ab-expressing strain (baIn34
[Peat-4::Abeta42, Pmyo-2::mCherry]; adIs1240[Peat-4::GFP]) was provided by the
Caldwell lab55. This strain was crossed to wild-type males, and the resulting male
progeny were crossed to spr-4(by105) homozygotes. Single F1 progeny bearing
both fluorescent markers were each placed on individual plates (singled) and the
subsequent F2 generation was singled and genotyped for spr-4. Homozygous spr4(by105) mutants were then singled for several generations to ensure homozygosity of the transgenes before analysis. To assess toxicity of the Ab42 transgene,
worms were synchronized by transferring 8–10 young adults (24 h post-L4) to a
fresh plate, and allowing them to lay eggs for 12–14 h. The adults were then removed
and eggs were allowed to hatch at 20 uC. Worms were then aged by transferring
adults to fresh, seeded plates every other day. At days 3 and 7 of adulthood, approximately 25–40 worms were immobilized with sodium azide on 2% agarose pads on
slides. Confocal z-sections covering the entire depth of the worms were taken on an
Olympus Fluoview Confocal Microscope using the 488 nm laser and a GFP filter.
The image files were then assigned to randomly named folders to blind the scoring
of the number of tail neurons per worm. Control and mutant worms were always
hatched, grown, aged and imaged in parallel, and the assay was repeated three times.
Statistical significance was assessed by paired t-test on both the distribution of neuronal number and the mean percent of the population without neurodegeneration.
SPR-4 localization and induction by paraquat. To create SPR-4::GFP transgenic animals, unc-119(ed3) worms were bombarded with a cosmid that had been
subjected to recombineering to introduce a GFP cassette onto the last exon of spr-4,
creating a C-terminal fusion. Wild-type moving worms were isolated and singled.
GFP signal was examined by confocal microscopy and worms with a bright, reproducible, and stable fluorescence were propagated. As described for the stress assay,
worms were then transferred to plates containing either 5 mM paraquat and 100 mg
ml21 fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) or FUdR alone. On day four of treatment, worms
were mounted on 2% agarose pads with sodium azide, and imaged by confocal
microscopy at 360 magnification with a 31.5 digital zoom and 488 nm laser and
GFP filter. z-stacks were taken throughout the head and tail regions of the worms,
and fluorescence intensity of the punctate GFP signal was analysed in ImageJ56. To
assess statistical significance, a paired t-test between control and treated fluorescence intensity distributions was performed. Images were taken for at least 15 worms
for each condition and each strain was analysed in an independent paraquat treatment. For localization, SPR-4::GFP transgenic animals were mated to wild type
males carrying the Prab-3::mCherry extrachromosomal array, and images were
taken by confocal microscopy.
ROS detection in C. elegans. To measure ROS levels, 100 4-day old adult worms,
grown as described for the paraquat survival assays, were transferred to Eppendorf
tubes containing 1.5 ml of M9 buffer, washed once in M9, and then stained for 1 h
in 500 ml of M9 containing 25 mM 29,79-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
(DCFDA, Life Sciences/Invitrogen) while rotating in the dark. Worms were then
washed once with M9, and transferred to 1.5% agarose pads on glass slides, covered, and immediately imaged within 1 h of washing out the DCFDA. Imaging was
performed on an Olympus Fluoview Confocal Microscope using the 488 nm laser
and GFP filter. At least 15 images were taken per genotype per replicate. Images
were analysed in ImageJ, where average intensity of the head region above the
terminal pharyngeal bulb was scored and plotted using the boxplot function in R.
REST cDNA constructs and shRNAs. The pHAGE-CMV-Flag-REST-IRESZsGreen and pHAGE-CMV-ZsGreen plasmids were generously provided by Peter
Mulligan57,58. The cDNA for wild-type mouse REST in the pCS21MT vector59 was
amplified by high fidelity PCR with BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites at 59 and 39
ends, respectively. The PCR amplicon was digested with BamHI and EcoRI followed by gel purification and ligation into the FUGW lentiviral vector driven by
the human ubiquitin C gene promoter60, and sequence verified. To generate the

nuclear translocation-defective mutant DREST (Fig. 3a, b), a nuclear localization
signal (amino acids 515–525)12 and the fifth zinc finger motif (amino acids 294–
324)61 were deleted by high fidelity PCR using primers listed in Supplementary
Table 2. The restriction site XbaI replaces amino acids 515–525 and adds two new
amino acids Ser-Arg. The restriction site NheI replaces amino acids 294–324 and
adds two new amino acids Ala-Ser.
Short-hairpin RNAs against human REST were expressed from the lentiviral
plasmid pGIPZ (Open Biosystems). Mature antisense sequences of effective shRNAs
are TCGATTAGTATTGTAGCCG (663–681) (shRESTa) and TTTGAACTGTA
AATATCTG (392–410) (shRESTb). Numbers in parenthesis indicate the position
of mature antisense sequences corresponding to the coding domain sequence (CDS)
of human REST (3294 bp). As a control, the GIPZ non-silencing shRNAmir was
used (Open Biosystems).
For C. elegans studies, full-length spr-4 was isolated from fosmid DNA (WRM
0628bF09, from the Sanger Institute collection) by PCR amplification with primers
specific to the promoter regions (1.5 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site)
and the UTR. The PCR product was sequence verified and used directly for injection. Human REST was isolated from cDNA and cloned into the vector pD152.79
MCS, downstream of the dpy-30 promoter and upstream of GFP. Sequencing verified the correct reading frame. The SPR-4::GFP fusion fosmid used in bombardment
(Clone: 3167840880351681 C09) was provided by the Transgenome consortium62.
Primers for sub-cloning are listed in Supplementary Table 2.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad software
and the R program. Student’s t-tests were used to make comparisons between two
groups with a normal distribution of data points. The Mann–Whitney-Wilcoxon
Test was used for multiple samples without knowledge of their distribution. Agerelated gene expression changes were identified by the Significant Analysis of
Microarray (SAM) in R program. SAM identifies differentially expressed genes
between young adult (less than 40 years, n 5 12) and Aged (greater than 70 years,
n 5 16) by carrying out gene-specific t-tests. Power analysis was used to ensure
adequate statistical power for detecting significant differentially expressed genes
in the microarray analysis. For sample n . 12 in each group, there is 80% power to
detect 1.5-fold changes at P value , 0.01. We therefore report significant age-related
gene expression changes using the cutoff q value , 0.01 and fold change .1.5. The
overlap of age-regulated genes with REST targets genes identified by ChIP-seq was
assessed using the hypergeometric test (P value 5 1.65 3 10212). Age-downregulated
genes are enriched in ChIP-seq targets based on the binomial test (P value 5 3.5
3 1027). Pathway and upstream regulator enrichment for age-regulated genes
and ChIP-seq target genes were analysed by the hypergeometric test using Ingenuity
pathway analysis (IPA). Pearson’s correlation is used in this paper. By the central
limit theorem, the distribution of the correlation coefficient is asymptotically normally distributed when the sample size is sufficiently large (n . 30). Hence, the P
value for the Pearson’s correlation coefficient for Fig. 6a, b, d are calculated based
on the normal distribution. Figure 6a shows plots for REST protein levels versus
cognitive test scores for multiple individual subjects. The correlation coefficient
between REST protein level and cognitive variables are calculated based on n 5 111.
Figure 6b shows a plot of REST protein level versus Braak Score. The correlation
coefficient between REST protein level and Braak Score is calculated based on
n 5 37. Figure 6d shows a plot of REST protein level versus age at death. The
correlation coefficient between REST protein level and age is calculated based on
n 5 61. Extended Fig. 2a compares the weighted mean expression level of REST
target genes versus age at death. Each point represents the mean of weighted expression of 342 REST target probe-sets that are age-regulated based on microarray.
These mean values were weighted by the total expression level for each probe-set
across all samples and were further normalized to the youngest adult value (24 years;
100%).

hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (top), dentate gyrus granule neurons
(middle, DG) and cerebellar Purkinje and granule cell neurons (bottom), from
young, aged or AD cases that were labelled for REST (green). Note the increased

death and the neuropathology of AD. a, REST knockdown with either of two
distinct shRNAs (sh-RESTa and sh-RESTb) significantly increases mRNA
expression of ChIP-seq targets related to cell death and AD pathology, whereas
REST overexpression (REST) represses gene expression. Values are the

REST, respectively. c, REST knockdown (sh-REST) markedly induces
phosho-tau epitopes (PHF-1 and AT8). Induction of these epitopes is blocked
by lithium chloride (LiCl), an inhibitor of the tau kinase GSK3b.

Extended Data Figure 4 | REST protects against oxidative stress. a, Cortical
neuronal cultures from REST-deficient (REST cKO) mice show extensive
neuritic degeneration relative to control cultures after incubation with 5 mM
oligomeric Ab42 for 24 h, which is prevented by lentiviral transduction of REST
(REST cKO 1 REST). Neuritic processes are labelled with antibody TUJ1.
Scale bar, 30 mm. b, Pro-apoptotic genes show increased mRNA expression in
REST-deficient cortical neuronal cultures after treatment with hydrogen
peroxide (50 mM H2O2, 3 h) or oligomeric Ab42 (5 mM, 8 h). Increased
expression was reversed by lentiviral transduction of REST (REST
cKO1REST). Values are the mean 6 s.e.m., n 5 4. *P , 0.05 by Student’s
unpaired t-test. c, REST knockdown potentiates hydrogen peroxide-induced
apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. Increased cell death was prevented by transducing
a REST construct (mouse REST) resistant to the shRNA. Cells were incubated
with 800 mM H2O2 for 2 h, and apoptotic cells were quantified by FACS
analysis of annexin V–APC. Values represent fold change relative to the
untreated control. d, REST knockdown (Sh-REST) increases vulnerability to
oxidative stress in cultured primary human cortical neurons treated with
100 mM H2O2 for 2 h relative to control cultures (Sh-CTRL). e, REST
knockdown increases generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Shown are

FACS profiles of a fluorescent ROS indicator (CellRox). Note right-ward shift
(increased ROS) in H2O2-treated (600 mM, 2 h) SH-SY5Y cells (red) versus
untreated controls (blue) following lentiviral transduction of REST shRNA
(Sh-REST). f, Increased ROS levels in SH-SY5Y cells expressing either of two
different REST shRNAs (sh-RESTa and sh-RESTb) is reversed by the
antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 5 mM). g, REST protects against oxidative
DNA damage. Shown is a measure of DNA fragmentation in the comet assay
following treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with H2O2. Note increase in DNA
damage induced by either of two REST shRNAs (Sh-RESTa and Sh-RESTb)
relative to cells transduced with a control shRNA (Sh-CTRL). Conversely,
overexpression of REST reduces oxidative DNA damage relative to
overexpression of GFP (CTRL). Horizontal bars indicate the mean value.

Extended Data Figure 5 | Caenorhabditis elegans spr genes and oxidative
stress resistance. a, Mutations of spr-1, spr-3 and spr-4 reduce survival in the
presence of oxidative stress. Worms were continuously incubated with the
superoxide-generating agent paraquat (5 mM). Shown are representative time
courses of survival, and quantification of reduced mean lifespan relative to
wild-type in worms incubated with paraquat. Shown are mutants in spr-1 and
spr-3, two different mutants in spr-4, and a double spr-3/spr-4 mutant
(spr-4(by105);spr-3(ok2525)). The spr-4(by105);spr-3(ok2525) mutant showed
similar survival to wild-type in the absence of paraquat. Values represent the
decrease in mean lifespan as percentage relative to wild type and represent
the mean 6 s.d., n 5 3. *P , 0.05 by log-rank test. b, Depletion of spr-4 by
RNAi increases sensitivity to oxidative stress and phenocopies the spr-4(by105)
mutation. Worms were fed RNAi against the indicated genes or an empty
vector control and then transferred to plates seeded with standard OP50
bacteria and containing 5 mM paraquat. Shown is the percent decrease in
mean survival relative to the empty vector control from 3 independent
experiments. Two spr-4 RNAi-expressing bacterial strains were used
(Methods). In addition to N2, we also used a C. elegans strain (TU3270) with
enhanced dsRNA uptake in neurons (Methods). One of the spr-4 RNAi strains
generated a significantly greater reduction in survival in the TU3270

background compared with N2. The paraquat sensitivity of worms fed RNAi
against the antioxidant gene sod-1 was used as a positive control. Values are
the mean 6 s.d., n 5 3. *P , 0.05 by log-rank test. c, A stably integrated

(1PQ) from day 1 to day 4 induces expression of SPR-4::GFP. Untreated

the lower panel graph shows quantitative analysis of SPR4::GFP expression in 3
separate strains. Horizontal bars indicate the median; boxed areas represent
the second and third quartiles. n 5 3 (15 worms each); ***P , 0.001 by
unpaired t-test. e, REST represses expression of the presenilin hop-1 in
C. elegans. Expression of hop-1 mRNA was measured by qRT–PCR in 24-h post
L4 worms of the indicated genotypes. For each replicate, transcript values were
normalized to cdc-42. Note that hop-1 mRNA expression is increased in the
spr-4(by105) mutant, and that repression is partially restored by wild-type
spr-4 or human REST (REST). Values represent fold change relative to the
wild-type control (1) and represent the mean 6 s.d., n 5 3. *P , 0.05 by

Extended Data Figure 7 | Induction of REST by Wnt signalling. a, Cell
non-autonomous induction of REST by aged brain extracts is partially
inhibited by the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf (DKK). Extracts were derived
from young adult (Y), aged (O) or AD PFC of the indicated ages and then
incubated with SH-SY5Y cells in the absence (-) or presence (1) of DKK
(250 ng ml21). b, Conditioned medium transferred from SH-SY5Y cells,
treated with either wortmannin (2 mM), tunicamycin (2 mM), H2O2 (100 mM)
or LiCl (10 mM), induce REST when added to naive cells, which is inhibited
by DKK. c, REST levels are increased by treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with
Wnt3a or 7a (250 ng ml21, 16 h; upper western blot), and by LiCl (5 or 10 mM,
6 h) or Chiron 99021 (20 nM, 6 h) (lower western blot). d, REST ChIP-seq
shows that the Wnt activator LiCl (5 mM) broadly increases REST binding to
target genes. Shown are REST targets (P , 1025) with REST–RE1 site binding

within 10 kb of the transcription start site. They include genes related
to AD pathology, such as the gamma secretase presenilin 2 (PSEN2), and

Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy shows colocalization of REST
with the autophagosome markers LC3, Atg7 and Atg12, but not with the
lysosomal markers LAMP1 or LAMP2. b, Nuclear REST levels are reduced by
activation of autophagy. SH-SY5Y cells were subject to serum withdrawal
(-FBS, 40 h) to induce autophagy and maintained in Opti-MEM to preserve cell

viability. Note that serum withdrawal results in depletion of nuclear REST
(loss of green labelling that overlaps with the blue DAPI nuclear stain), which is
restored by bafilomycin (-FBS/Baf). c, The autophagy inhibitors

Extended Data Figure 10 | REST, longevity and stress resistance.
a, Prefrontal cortical (upper panel), hippocampal CA1 (middle panel) and
cerebellar (lower panel) sections of individuals ranging in age from 57–102
years were double-labelled for REST (green) and the neuronal marker MAP2
(red). Cases with extreme longevity (98, 102 years) are associated with marked
induction of REST in prefrontal cortical and hippocampal CA1 neurons,
but not in cerebellar Purkinje cell (ovals) or granule cell neurons (to the right of
the dashed line). Scale bar, 20 mm. b, REST increases the expression of genes

associated with stress resistance and longevity. Shown are fold changes in
mRNA levels for catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and FOXO1
following REST knockdown (sh-RESTa or sh-RESTb) or overexpression
(REST). Values represent the mean 6 s.d., *P , 0.05 by Student’s unpaired

almost completely abolishes FOXO1 protein, which is prevented by
shRNA-resistant mouse REST.
