Abstract

Author Manuscript

The gene silencing transcription factor REST/NRSF (Repressor Element-1 (RE1) Silencing
Transcription Factor/Neuron-Restrictive Silencer Factor) actively represses a large array of coding
and noncoding neuron-specific genes important to synaptic plasticity including miR-132. miR-132
is a neuron-specific microRNA and plays a pivotal role in synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity and
structural remodeling. However, a role for miR-132 in neuronal death is not, as yet, welldelineated. Here we show that ischemic insults promote REST binding and epigenetic remodeling
at the miR-132 promoter and silencing of miR-132 expression in selectively-vulnerable
hippocampal CA1 neurons. REST occupancy was not altered at the miR-9 or miR-124a promoters
despite the presence of RE1 sites, indicating REST target specificity. Ischemia induced a
substantial decrease in two marks of active gene transcription, dimethylation of lysine 4 on core
histone 3 (H3K4me2) and acetylation of lysine 9 on H3 (H3K9ac) at the miR-132 promoter.
RNAi-mediated depletion of REST in vivo blocked ischemia-induced loss of miR-132 in insulted
hippocampal neurons, consistent with a causal relation between activation of REST and silencing
of miR-132. Overexpression of miR-132 in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons or delivered
directly into the CA1 of living rats by means of the lentiviral expression system prior to induction
of ischemia afforded robust protection against ischemia-induced neuronal death. These findings
document a previously unappreciated role for REST-dependent repression of miR-132 in the
neuronal death associated with global ischemia and identify a novel therapeutic target for
amelioration of the neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits associated with ischemic stroke.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

REST (Repressor Element-1 Silencing Transcription factor, also termed NRSF) is a genesilencing transcription factor that is widely expressed during embryogenesis and the late
stages of neuronal differentiation and its loss is critical for elaboration of the neuronal
phenotype [1–4]. In pluripotent stem cells and neural progenitors, REST actively represses a
large array of coding and noncoding neuron-specific genes important to synaptic plasticity
and structural remodeling including miR-132 [1–4]. A subset of microRNAs including
miR-9, miR-124a, and miR-132 contain RE-1 sites within their promoter regions in mouse
and humans [5,6] and are functionally validated targets of REST in mammalian cell lines
[5]. In mature neurons, REST is quiescent, but can be reactivated in selectively-vulnerable
hippocampal neurons by ischemic insults [7–9] and seizures [10,11] and in human brain by
normal aging [12]. In Huntington’s disease, REST aberrantly accumulates in the nucleus of
medium aspiny striatal neurons [13]. However, whether neuronal insults promote activation
and recruitment of REST to the promoters of miRNAs and whether REST orchestrates
epigenetic remodeling and silencing of miRNAs in response to neuronal insults is, as yet,
unclear.

microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that serve to negatively regulate protein
expression through mRNA degradation and translational repression [14,15]. miRNAs are
particularly enriched in the nervous system, where they play a pivotal role in synaptic
plasticity and structural remodeling [16]. Emerging evidence points to a widespread role for
miRNAs as key modulators of target gene expression in neurons. microRNAs play a pivotal
role in synapse formation and maturation and dendritogenesis in early stages of brain
development [4,14,15]. A key feature of neuronal miRNAs is their ability to regulate entire
networks of nonneuronal genes in an activity- or experience-dependent manner [15].
Moreover, neuron-specific miRNAs can regulate mRNA translation locally in dendrites,
where they are thought to play an important role in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity
[4,14,15].

Author Manuscript

miR-132 is one of the best characterized miRNAs in the nervous system. In neurons,
miR-132 localizes to the presynaptic membrane, where it represses methyl CpG binding
protein-2 (MeCP2), a gene-silencing factor that recognizes methylated DNA and reads
epigenetic marks [17,18]. Repression of MeCP2 results in activation of brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which in turn activates miR-132, thereby constituting a selfregulatory mechanism [19]. miR-132 is well-known for its role in plasticity and activitydependent shaping of dendritic morphology and synaptic function [14,15]. miR-132 is
important for activity-dependent dendritic growth and remodeling, implicating miR-132 in
the development and fine-tuning of neural circuits in response to environmental cues [20].
An important mechanism by which miR-132 exerts its growth-promoting effects is by
repression of small Rho GTPases, such as p250GAP, which serve as regulators of the
dendritic actin cytoskeleton. Suppression of p250GAP by miR-132 is required for both basal
and activity-induced dendrite growth [20–22]. Dysregulation of miR-132 and its target
proteins are implicated in the pathophysiology of epilepsy [23,24], Alzheimer’s disease
[25,26], and Parkinson’s disease [27]. Whereas a role for miR-132 in the neuronal death

associated with these disorders is well-established [14], its role in the pathogenesis of global
ischemia is, as yet, unclear.

Author Manuscript

Transient global ischemia arising as a consequence of cardiac arrest in humans or induced
experimentally in animals causes selective, delayed death of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal
neurons and cognitive impairment [28–30]. The long delay between ischemic insult and
neuronal death is consistent with a role for gene transcription. Effective treatments to
ameliorate the neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction associated with global ischemia
are an unmet need. The present study was undertaken to examine a possible role for
miR-132, a neuron-specific miRNA known to play a pivotal role in brain development, in
ischemia-induced neuronal death. Our findings demonstrate that ischemic insults trigger
activation of REST and REST-dependent silencing of miR-132 in selectively-vulnerable
CA1 neurons and that REST-dependent repression of miR-132 is critical to ischemiainduced neuronal death in a clinically-relevant model of ischemic stroke in vivo.

RESULTS
Ischemia activates REST, recruits REST to the miR-132 promoter, and silences miR-132 in
CA1

Transient global ischemia in rats is a well-established model of neuronal insult in which cell
death occurs primarily in CA1 pyramidal neurons and is delayed by 3–4 d, allowing
examination of molecular mechanisms that underlie cell death [28–30]. Global ischemia
induced a marked increase in REST protein abundance in the nuclear fraction of the
selectively vulnerable CA1, evident at 24 h and 48 h (Fig.1a). Ischemia induced enrichment
of REST in close proximity to the three RE1 sites within the miR-132 promoter of rat
identified by the JASPAR CORE database (http://jaspar.genereg.net/), relative to that of
sham-operated (control) animals (Fig. 1b). To examine whether the increase in REST at the
miR-132 promoter translates into altered miR-132 expression, we performed RT-qPCR at
times after ischemia. Ischemia induced a marked decrease in miR-132 expression in CA1,
evident at 24 h and 48 h after ischemia (Fig. 1c). Whereas ischemia induced enrichment for
REST at the miR-132 promoter and repressed miR-132 expression, it did not significantly
alter occupancy of REST at the promoters of miR-9 or miR-124a (each of which contain one
or more RE1 sites), nor did it alter miR-9 or miR-124a expression (Fig. 1d–g). Moreover,
ischemia did not detectably alter REST occupancy at sites either 8.5 kb upstream or 10 kb
downstream from the miR-132 promoter (negative control sites) or at the promoter of the βactin gene, a negative control (data not illustrated). Furthermore, the expression of miR-132,
miR-9 and miR-124a was not altered in the resistant CA3 (Fig. 1h). These data indicate that
global ischemia promotes REST abundance and REST binding to the miR-132 promoter in
the selectively vulnerable CA1 in vivo in a target- and subfield-specific manner.
REST orchestrates epigenetic remodeling of the miR-132 promoter
The findings thus far indicate that REST regulates miR-132 expression in insulted
hippocampal neurons, but do not address the mechanism by which this occurs. To address
this issue, we examined alterations in epigenetic marks proximal to the RE1 sites in the
promoter region of miR-132 (Fig. 2a, upper). Toward this end, we examined dimethylation

of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me2), acetylation of lysine 9 on histone 3 (H3K9ac),
epigenetic marks of open chromatin and active gene transcription, and trimethylation of
lysine 27 on histone (H3K27me3), an epigenetic mark of gene repression, in the selectively
vulnerable CA1 after ischemia. Whereas H3K4 is demethylated by LSD1, H3K9 is
deacetylated by HDACs. Global ischemia induced a marked decrease in H3K4me2 in the
CA1, evident at 24 h and 48 h (Fig. 2a, lower), and a marked decrease in H3K9ac in the
CA1, evident at 48 h (Fig. 2b) after ischemia at the promoter of miR-132 as assessed by
ChIP-qPCR. In contrast, ischemia did not detectably alter methylation of H3K4 or
acetylation of H3K9 at sites 8.5 kb upstream or 10 kb downstream of the miR-132 promoter
(Fig. 2a,b). Moreover, ischemia did not significantly alter methylation of H3K27 at the
promoter of miR-132 (Fig. 2c). These findings indicate that the REST corepressor complex
is active and orchestrates epigenetic remodeling of the REST target miR-132 in CA1
neurons destined to die

Knockdown of REST prevents the ischemia-induced decrease in miR-132

Author Manuscript

The results thus far indicate a possible role of REST in miR-132 expression, but do not
address the causal relation between activation of REST and silencing of miR-132 regulation.
To address this issue, we designed and validated two REST shRNA constructs that
effectively suppress REST expression in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons (Fig.
3a,b) and in the CA1 in vivo [9]. We next assessed the impact of acute knockdown of REST
on miR-132 expression. Toward this end, we delivered lentivirus carrying REST shRNA
unilaterally into the CA1 by stereotaxic injection, and 14 d later, subjected rats to global
ischemia (Fig. 3c, upper). Whereas ischemia suppressed miR-132 expression in the CA1 of
rats expressing NT-shRNA, miR-132 expression was not detectably altered in the CA1 of
rats expressing REST shRNA as assessed by RT-qPCR, at 48 h after ischemia (Fig. 3c,
lower). In contrast, ischemia did not detectably alter miR-124a expression in the CA1 of
animals expressing either NT- or REST shRNA (Fig. 3d). These findings demonstrate that
acute knockdown of REST prevents the ischemia-induced decrease in miR-132, consistent
with the notion that REST is essential for the ischemia-induced decrease in miR-132.
Overexpression of miR-132 affords neuroprotection against ischemia-induced cell death

Author Manuscript

To address a possible causal relation between loss of miR-132 and ischemia-induced
neuronal death, we overexpressed miR-132 in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons at
DIV7, and 7d later, subjected neurons to OGD. OGD is a well-established model of global
ischemia in vitro. Toward this end, we examined the impact of OGD on REST abundance
and miR-132 expression. OGD elicited an increase in REST and a decrease in miR-132, but
not miR-9 or miR-132, in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons in vitro (Fig. 4a,b).
Next, we validated miR-132 overexpression in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons
transduced by means of the lentivirus expression system. Lentiviral expression was robust in
hippocampal neurons at 7 d after transduction, as assessed by GFP fluorescence (Fig. 4c,
left). miR-132, but not miR-9 or miR-124a, was overexpressed ~10-fold relative to that of
negative-miR expressing or nontransduced (control) neurons (Fig. 4c, right). Finally, we
examined impact of miR-132 on ischemia-induced neuronal death in vitro. Overexpression
of miR-132 markedly reduced OGD-induced neuronal death, as assessed by uptake of the
DNA indicator dye propidium iodide (Fig. 4d).

To establish a causal relation between the decrease in miR-132 and ischemia-induced
neuronal death in a clinically relevant model of ischemic stroke, we delivered lentivirus
carrying miR-132 or negative miR by unilateral stereotaxic injection directly into the right
CA1 of living animals; 14 d later, rats were subjected to global ischemia or sham operation.
Whereas negative miR-expressing rats subjected to global ischemia exhibited robust
neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1, as assessed by toluidine blue (Fig. 5a,b) and
Fluoro-Jade (Fig. 5c,d) staining at 7 d after insult, neuronal death was strikingly reduced in
the CA1 of rats overexpressing miR-132. Collectively, these findings indicate that miR-132
overexpression affords robust protection against global ischemia-induced neuronal death,
and document a causal relation between the ischemia-induced loss of miR-132 and neuronal
death in in vitro and in vivo models of ischemia.

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In this study we show that activation of the gene silencing transcription factor REST is
causally related to loss of miR-132 in postischemic CA1 neurons and that REST-dependent
repression of miR-132 is critical to the neuronal death associated with global ischemia.
miR-132 overexpression in hippocampal neurons or the CA1 of living rats affords robust
protection against ischemia-induced neuronal death. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that regulation of miR-132 or any miRNA by REST is causally related to
ischemia-induced neuronal death. Whereas miR-132 is implicated in the neuronal death
associated with epilepsy [23,24], Alzheimer’s disease [25,26] and Parkinson’s disease [27]
and is thought to play a role in ischemic preconditioning [31], a role for miR-132 in
ischemia-induced neuronal death has remained unclear. We show that the repressor REST is
enriched at the miR-132 promoter, where it orchestrates epigenetic remodeling and silencing
of miR-132 expression in postischemic CA1 (but not CA3). Consistent with this, ischemia
triggers a substantial decrease in two epigenetic marks of active gene transcription,
H3K4me2 and H3K9ac (but not H3K27me3, a mark of gene repression), in the selectively
vulnerable CA1 after ischemia. By contrast, neither REST occupancy at the miR-9 or
miR-124a promoters nor miR-9 or miR-124a expression is altered in post ischemic neurons,
despite the presence of RE1 sites, consistent with REST target specificity. Emerging
evidence supports the concept that REST regulates different networks of target genes in a
context-, age- and cell type-specific manner [9]. These findings document a previously
unappreciated role for REST-dependent repression of miR-132 in the neuronal death
associated with global ischemia and identify a novel therapeutic target for amelioration of
the neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits associated with ischemic stroke.

Author Manuscript

A fundamental mechanism by which REST silences target genes is that of epigenetic
remodeling [32]. REST binds the RE1 element of target genes and recruits C-terminal
cofactor for REST (CoREST) [33,34], and mSin3A [35–37], corepressor platforms that
recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 2. HDACs deacetylate core histone proteins and
affect dynamic and reversible gene silencing [1,2,38]. In addition, REST recruits the sitespecific histone protein G9a, which methylates lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9) [39,40], the
site-specific histone demethylase LSD1, which removes methyl groups from mono- or
dimethylated lysine 4 of core histone protein H3 (H3K4) [41,42], and MeCP2, a protein that
reads epigenetic marks on core histones and hotspots of DNA methylation [39,43]. Recent

studies indicate that deacetylation of H3K9 by HDACs stimulates LSD activity, which in
turn, removes methylation marks from H3K4 [2]. Our findings in the present study that
H3K4me2 and H3K9ac, marks of active gene transcription, are reduced at the miR-132
promoter in postischemic CA1 are consistent with transcriptional repression. Whereas
dimethylation of H3K4 is a functional read-out of LSD1, a reduction in acetylation of H3K9
is a functional read-out of HDAC activity. Our finding that H3K27me3, a mark of gene
repression, is not altered at the miR-132 promoter is consistent with the possibility that the
polycomb protein EZH1/2 is not recruited to the miR-132 promoter. EZH2, the catalytically
active component of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is a histone methyltransferase
that confers a trimethylation mark on Lys27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), a mark of gene
repression [44–46]. Recent studies indicate that PRC2 is recruited by REST via HOTAIR
[47] and that PRC1 interacts with REST at RE1 sites [48]. Whereas we show that REST is
causally related to ischemia-induced loss of miR-132, we do not address a causal relation
between REST and epigenetic remodeling of the miR-132 promoter.
An emerging view is that epigenetics includes DNA methylation, histone modifications and
miRNA-dependent gene silencing [3,4,49,50]. Collectively, these mechanisms influence
gene expression and phenotype. An interesting aspect of miRNA function is its ability to
induce epigenetic modifications directly and indirectly [49]. miRNAs act indirectly to
promote epigenetic remodeling by regulation of components of the epigenetic machinery
including, but not limited to DNA methyltransferases, HDACs, polycomb group proteins
and MeCP2, which in turn regulate the expression of a wide array of genes including
miRNAs [51]. Thus, miRNAs can participate in ‘epigenetic-miRNA regulatory circuits’
[51]. As an example, miR-132 represses MeCP2, leading to activation of BDNF, which in
turn functions as an activator of miR-132 [19].

Our finding that miR-132 is dysregulated in global ischemia is consistent with findings of
others that miR-132 and its target proteins are implicated in the pathophysiology of other
brain disorders including focal ischemia [31], epilepsy [23,24,52], Alzheimer’s disease
[25,26] and Parkinson’s disease [27]. Whereas findings in the present study show that global
ischemia (a paradigm that induces neuronal death) induces downregulation of miR-132 in
the hippocampal CA1, findings of others [31] show that ischemic preconditioning (a
paradigm that affords neuroprotection) induces downregulation of miR-132 in the cortex in
a model of focal ischemia. However, upon closer inspection, the same study [31] reports that
focal ischemia (which induces fulminating neuronal death primarily in the striatum and
cortex) also elicits downregulation of miR-132 expression. Thus, the two models of
ischemic stroke, focal and global ischemia, exert similar effects on miR-132 expression,
despite the fact that they induce cell death via different mechanisms and target different
populations of neurons. Studies involving unbiased, genome-wide studies and bioinformatic
analysis reveal upregulation of miR-132 in the hippocampal CA3 of animals with status
epilepticus and in humans with epilepsy [24,53,54]. Chemically-engineered oligonucleotides
or ‘antagomirs’ directed against miR-132 efficiently silenced miR-132 and afforded
neuroprotection in animal with status epilepticus, consistent with the concept that miR-132
is causally-related to seizure-induced neuronal death [24]. In contrast, in Alzheimer’s
disease, miR-132 appears to have a pro-survival function. These studies show that miR-132

is downregulated, and its targets PTEN, P300, and FOXO3, are upregulated in the temporal
cortical areas and hippocampal CA1 from humans with Alzheimer’s disease [25,26]. The
present study adds global ischemia to the growing list of brain disorders in which miR-132
is causally related to neuronal survival or neuronal death. We show that REST-dependent
silencing of miR-132 is causally related to ischemia-induced neuronal death and that
overexpression of miR-132 in the CA1 of living rats affords robust protection against
ischemia-induced neuronal death in a clinically-relevant model of ischemic stroke.

Author Manuscript

Key targets of miR-132, including transcription factors and signaling molecules, are
expressed in neurons and are implicated in neuronal death. In the present study, although we
find that global ischemia elicits a marked upregulation of REST and a marked
downregulation of miR-132, surprisingly we did not detect altered expression of several
prominent targets of miR-132 implicated in other paradigms of neuronal death (MeCP2,
PTEN, FOXO3a, DNMT3a, AchE) in the selectively-vulnerable CA1 at either 24 or 48 h
after ischemia. Future studies are warranted to identify possible targets of miR-132 that are
regulated by and/or contribute to global ischemia-induced neuronal death.

Author Manuscript

The present study was undertaken to examine a possible role for miR-132, a neuron-specific
miRNA known to play a pivotal role in brain development, in ischemia-induced neuronal
death. Our findings demonstrate that activation of REST is causally related to silencing of
miR-132 in selectively-vulnerable CA1 neurons and that REST-dependent repression of
miR-132 is critical to ischemia-induced neuronal death in a clinically-relevant model of
ischemic stroke in vivo. Notably, overexpression of miR-132 in the hippocampal CA1 of
living rats affords robust protection against ischemia-induced neuronal death. These findings
document a previously unappreciated role for REST-dependent repression of miR-132 in the
neuronal death associated with global ischemia and identify a novel therapeutic target for
amelioration of the neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits associated with ischemia.
These findings implicate miRNAs in the pathophysiology of global ischemia and point to a
role for miRNA-132 as a novel therapeutic target to reduce the hippocampal injury
associated with ischemic stroke.

MATERIALS & METHODS
Animals

Author Manuscript

Four to six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150–200 gm (Charles River
Laboratories, Inc.) were maintained in a temperature- and light-controlled environment with
a 12:12 h light/dark cycle and were treated in accordance with the principles and procedures
of the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine.
Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)
Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared from embryonic (E18) rats as
described [9]. Cultures were maintained for 7 days in vitro (DIV) before transduction with
lentiviral constructs. OGD was performed at 14 DIV. To induce OGD, neurons were

exposed to serum-free, glucose-free medium saturated with 95% N2/5% CO2 for 30 min at
37°C in an airtight, anoxic chamber (Billups-Rothenberg). Cultures were returned to
oxygenated, glucose-containing medium under normoxic conditions for 24 h and were
processed for western blotting analysis, qRT-PCR or uptake of propidium iodide to assess
neuronal death.
Global ischemia

Author Manuscript

Animals were subjected to transient global ischemia by the four-vessel occlusion method as
described [9,55]. For sham surgery, animals were subjected to the identical surgical
procedure, except that the carotid arteries were not occluded. During recovery from
anesthesia, body temperature was maintained at 37.5 ± 0.5 °C by external warming. Animals
that failed to show complete loss of the righting reflex and dilation of the pupils 2 min after
occlusion, and the rare animals that exhibited obvious behavioral manifestations (abnormal
vocalization when handled, generalized convulsions, loss of > 20% body weight by 3–7 d or
hypoactivity) were excluded from the study.
Western blots

Author Manuscript

Western blot analysis was performed as described [55–57]. In brief, neurons were washed
with ice-cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing (in mM): 25 Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 NaCl, 1
EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), 0.1% SDS and 0.5% Na deoxycholate. For
the tissue samples, hippocampi were rapidly dissected and transverse slices of dorsal
hippocampus (1 mm) were cut with a Mcllwain tissue chopper. The CA1 subfield was
rapidly microdissected and lysed in buffer supplemented with a 1% cocktail of protease
inhibitors (Sigma). Protein concentrations were measured by means of the bicinchoninic
acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). Equal concentrations of protein (30 ~ 50 µg) were separated on
4–20% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with antiREST, 1:1000 (Millipore) and anti-β-actin, 1:50000(Sigma), followed by chemiluminescent
detection(ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Band densities were normalized to β-actin. Mean
band densities for samples from experimental animals were normalized to the corresponding
samples from control neurons or sham animals.
Single-Locus ChIP-qPCR

Author Manuscript

The CA1 subfields were rapidly microdissected from hippocampi and used for the ChIP
assay as described [57]. In brief, the CA1 was immersed in 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at
room temperature to cross-link REST or histone protein to DNA and the cross-linking halted
by addition of 0.125 M glycine. The samples were lysed and sonicated to generate fragments
of chromosomal DNA in the range of 300 bp. Aliquots of chromatin were diluted with ChIP
dilution buffer to a final volume of 1 ml, and an aliquot of pre-immunoprecipitated
chromatin (“input”, 80 µl) was saved. Samples of chromatin were pre-cleared with M-280
sheep anti-rabbit IgG Dynabeads (Invitrogen) and immunoprecipitated with primary
antibody (10 µg of anti-REST, anti-H3K9ac or anti-H3K4me2, Milipore).
Immunocompelxes were collected on the Dynabeads and eluted with elution buffer (50 mM
Tris, 10mM EDTA, 1% SDS). Following elution, samples were treated with proteinase K
and purified by means of a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). For technical validation
experiments, ChIP output of anti-REST-precipitated chromatin and total chromatin were

For cultures, neurons were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and for tissue samples, the CA1
was rapidly microdissected. RNA was extracted using mirVana (Ambion), and
concentration was measured with a Nanodrop (NanoDrop Technologies). Aliquots of RNA
(10 ng) were reverse-transcribed to cDNA with the TaqMan®MicroRNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Appiled Biosystems). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed
using TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) for miR-132 (Ref: 000457); miR-9 (Ref:
000583); miR-124a (Ref: 001182); and U6 snRNA (Ref: 001973) served as an endogenous
reference. Reactions were run in triplicate in a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems). The relative change in the miRNA expression was determined by the equation:

cycle number at which the fluorescence signal crosses a threshold. Relative expression ratios
were calculated by normalization of values for experimental samples to those of the
corresponding control neurons or sham controls.
miR-132 overexpression constructs and lentiviral vectors

pRRL.PPT.hCMV.GFP.shRNA.Wpre transfer construct, pMDLg/pRRE and pRSV-REV
packaging constructs, and the envelope protein construct pMD2.G. Titers were calculated by
infecting HEK-293T cells with serial dilutions of concentrated lentivirus, and eGFP
fluorescence was evaluated by flow cytometry at 48 h after transduction; Titers were 1 × 109
transducing units. The expression of miR-132 was examined by qPCR 7 d following
transduction of primary hippocampal neurons prepared from E18 Sprague Dawley rats.
Injection of lentiviral miR-132 in vivo
Lentiviral miR-132 or negative control miR was administered to rats by stereotaxic injection
14 d prior to global ischemia or sham surgery. A total volume of 4 µl of viral solution was
injected directly into the right CA1 (3.0 mm posterior and 2.0 mm lateral to bregma, 4.0 mm
below the skull surface) using a 28-gauge needle and a Hamilton syringe at a flow rate of
0.5 µl/min.

Histology and Fluoro-Jade labeling
Neuronal cell loss was assessed by histological examination of the dorsal hippocampus from
animals killed at 7 d after sham surgery or global ischemia. Animals were anesthetized with
halothane and transcardially perfused using 0.9% saline with heparin followed by ice-cold
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4. Brains were removed and immersed in
fixative. Coronal sections (20 µm) were cut at the level of the dorsal hippocampus with a
cryotome and processed for staining with toluidine blue or Fluoro-Jade C (Millipore).
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

For qRT-PCR, significance was assessed by means of the randomization test [60] and a
Student's t-test (unpaired, two-tailed). For Western band densities and radioactive band
densities, significance was assessed by means of the Student's t-test (unpaired, two-tailed). P
< 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
