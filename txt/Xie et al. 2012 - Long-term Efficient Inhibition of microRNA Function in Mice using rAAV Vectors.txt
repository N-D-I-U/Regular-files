Abstract

Author Manuscript

Understanding the function of individual microRNA (miRNA) species in mice would require the
production of hundreds of loss-of-function strains. To accelerate analysis of miRNA biology in
mammals, we combined recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors with miRNA `Tough
Decoys' (TuDs) to inhibit specific miRNAs. Intravenous injection of rAAV9 expressing antimiR-122 or anti-let-7 TuD depleted the corresponding miRNA and increased its mRNA targets.
rAAV producing anti-miR-122—but not anti-let-7—TuD reduced serum cholesterol by >30% for
25 weeks in wild-type mice. High throughput sequencing of liver miRNAs from the treated mice
confirmed that the targeted miRNAs were depleted and revealed that TuD RNAs induce miRNA
tailing and trimming in vivo. rAAV-mediated miRNA inhibition thus provides a simple way to
study miRNA function in adult mammals and a potential therapy for dyslipidemia and other
diseases caused by miRNA deregulation.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) repress the expression of mRNAs with which they can partially base
pair; miRNAs are predicted to regulate more than half of all protein-coding genes in
mammals1,2, but few miRNA-target interactions have been experimentally validated,
especially in vivo.

Genetic disruption of a miRNA gene provides a powerful strategy to study miRNA function,
but many miRNA genes share the same seed sequence—the 6–8 nt miRNA region that
defines its target repertoire—and therefore one member of a miRNA family may
compensate for loss of another. Creating an animal model in which all members of a
miRNA family are deleted is daunting. Moreover, humans and mice share more than 276
miRNAs, requiring hundreds of conditional knockout strains to assess the function and
contribution to disease of each conserved miRNA in adult mice. Currently, chemically
modified oligonucleotides (AMOs) complementary to mature miRNAs are widely used to
inhibit miRNAs in vitro and in vivo3–5. Effective AMOs typically employ expensive or
proprietary modifications such as 2′-O-methyl, 2′-O-methoxyethyl, or 2′,4′-methylene
(LNA) and require repeated administration to suppress expression of the cognate miRNA5–8.
Current chemistries and formulations do not permit delivery of AMOs to many tissues or
organs.
Plasmid DNA vectors that express miRNA “sponges”—multiple, tandem miRNA binding
sites designed to competitively inhibit miRNA function—have been used in cultured cells9
and in flies10. Depletion of miR-223 using a sponge-expressing lentiviral vector to stably
modify hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo, followed by bone marrow reconstitution in mice,
produced a phenotype similar to that observed in a genetic miRNA knockout11. Lentiviral
vectors delivered by stereotaxic injection into the brain have been used to express miRNA-

inhibiting sponges to study miRNA function in neurons in vivo12. However, the risk of
insertional mutagenesis and the requirement for ex vivo manipulation may limit the use of
lentiviral vector-based miRNA inhibition for functional genomics studies and human
therapy.

Author Manuscript

Delivery of miRNA inhibitors using the 4.7 kb single-stranded DNA parvovirus Adenoassociated virus (AAV) promises to circumvent many of the risks associated with lentiviral
vectors13. In the past decade, new recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors have been created
from natural AAV serotypes, providing efficient gene transfer vehicles that target diverse
tissues in mice and non-human primates14. Local delivery by direct injection of AAV2expressed miRNA sponges into the eye allowed Filipowicz and coworkers to inhibit
miR-96, miR-182, and miR-183 in the mouse retina15. The same miRNA cluster was
inhibited by expressing sponges from a transgene specifically transcribed in the mouse
retina16. More recently, compact, RNA polymerase III-driven miRNA decoys have been
reported, including “Tough Decoy” (TuD) RNAs and miRZips, both of which inhibit
miRNA function in cultured cells and in vivo17,18. The relative potencies of these inhibitors
and their ability to stably and efficiently inhibit miRNAs over the long-term in adult
mammals have not yet been tested.

Author Manuscript

Here, we report proof-of-concept studies using TuDs delivered systemically in mice via
rAAV vectors. Each TuD depleted the targeted miRNA and increased the expression of the
corresponding miRNA target genes. miRNA depletion in vivo was accompanied by the 3′
addition of non-templated nucleotides as well as 3′-to-5′ shortening of the miRNA, a
degradation pathway previously observed in flies and transformed, cultured human cells19.
Our data suggest that rAAV-expressing TuD RNAs could enable the study of miRNA
functions in adult mammals and perhaps even form the basis for stable therapy for
hypercholesterolemia and other disorders caused by aberrant miRNA expression.

Results
TuDs inhibit miRNA function more effectively than sponges or miRZips
To test the efficacy of transcribed sponges12, TuD RNAs25 (Supplementary Fig. 1) and
miRZips9,17,20, we targeted the abundant miRNA miR-122, which regulates cholesterol
biosynthesis, and the anti-oncogenic miRNA let-7 (Supplementary Table 1). miRNA
sponges were expressed using the RNA polymerase II SV40 promoter, the liver-specific
TBG promoter or the RNA polymerase III U6 promoter; the U6 promoter was used to drive
TuD and miRZip expression (Fig. 1a,b).

Author Manuscript

For each miRNA inhibitor, we measured its ability to de-repress a nuclear-targeted βgalactosidase (nLacZ) reporter mRNA containing one or three fully complementary
miR-122-binding sites in its 3′ untranslated region (UTR). Reporter expression was reduced
by ~50% when one miR-122-binding site was present in the nLacZ 3′ UTR and >80% when
three sites were present (Fig.1c). We co-transfected the nLacZ reporter plasmid with each
miR-122 inhibitor construct or with a control plasmid into HuH-7, a human hepatoma cell
line expressing ~16,000 miR-122 molecules per cell21. Among the RNA polymerase IIdriven anti-miR-122 sponges, only the strong liver-specific TBG promoter increased

expression of nLacZ bearing a single miR-122-binding site, indicating that the sponge
partially inhibited miR-122. However, nLacZ expression was not significantly increased by
the sponge when the reporter contained three miR-122-binding sites (Fig. 1c), suggesting
that the change in miR-122 activity or concentration was too small to overcome the greater
repression conferred by three sites.

Author Manuscript

In contrast, both the one- and three-site reporters were de-repressed by the RNA polymerase
III-driven anti-miR-122 TuD RNA. For the one-site reporter, the TuD restored nLacZ
expression to that observed when no miR-122 target sites were present in the reporter (Fig.
1c). To remove potential promoter differences, we compared three U6-driven miR-122
antagonist constructs—sponge, TuD, and miRZip—using the nLacZ reporter containing
three miR-122-binding sites. (Sponges transcribed by RNA polymerase III were previously
shown to be no more effective than those transcribed by RNA polymerase II, perhaps
because the RNA polymerase III transcript accumulates in the nucleus rather than the
cytoplasm9.) Again, only the TuD significantly (p-value < 0.001) de-repressed nLacZ
repression by miR-122 in HuH-7 cells (Fig. 1d). The anti-miR-122 TuD expression
construct but not an anti-let-7 TuD or an anti-miR-122 or anti-let-7 sponge, was similarly
effective in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells artificially expressing pri-miR-122
from a co-transfected plasmid (Fig. 1e).

Author Manuscript

miRNAs that are extensively complementary to their targets direct Argonaute2 protein to
cleave the mRNA, whereas less extensive complementarity generally decreases mRNA
stability. To test if the TuD RNA can also inhibit repression directed by a miRNA with
imperfect complementarity to its target, we designed a firefly luciferase (Fluc) reporter with
seven copies of a bulged miR-122-binding site in its 3′ UTR; FLuc with seven mutant sites
served as a control (Supplementary Table 1). The miR-122-responsive FLuc reporter, antimiR-122, anti-let-7 or control TuD plasmid, and, as an internal control, a Renilla reniformis
luciferase (RLuc) plasmid, were introduced into HuH-7 cells by transfection. The antimiR-122 TuD, but not the control or anti-let-7 TuDs, fully de-repressed FLuc expression
(Fig. 1f). The TuD inhibitors were also specific: the anti-let-7, but not the anti-miR-122,
TuD increased expression of both Dicer mRNA and protein; Dicer is an endogenous let-7
target (Fig. 1g,h and Supplementary Fig. 2). Our in vitro data suggest that among the three
miRNA antagonists we evaluated in vitro—sponge, TuD, and miRZip—a TuD transcribed
from a U6 promoter is the most potent miRNA antagonist.
Monitoring miRNA function in living mice

Author Manuscript

To test the ability of TuD RNAs to inhibit miRNA function in vivo, we constructed a series
of rAAV vector genomes expressing a miRNA-responsive Gaussia princeps (Gp) luciferase
reporter gene22 (Fig. 2a). GLuc is a secreted protein, enabling detection of the reporter in the
blood or urine of live animals. We added seven bulged miR-122 or let-7 target sites to the 3′
UTR of the GLuc mRNA to render it miRNA-responsive and inserted the U6 promoterdriven TuD cassette targeting either miR-122 or let-7 into the GLuc intron. Reporters
lacking either the seven miRNA-binding sites, the TuD expression cassette or both served as
controls. In HuH-7 cells, the anti-miR-122, but not anti-let-7, TuD de-repressed the reporter

bearing seven miR-122-binding sites (Fig. 2b). Similarly, in HeLa cells only the anti-let-7
TuD RNA de-repressed the reporter bearing seven let-7-binding sites (Fig. 2c).
Both miR-122 and let-7 are present in liver21, and let-7 is also found in heart23. miR-122
comprises 70% of total liver miRNA21, posing a stringent test for the ability of TuDs to
inhibit the function of even the most abundant miRNA species. We packaged the rAAV
genomes into the AAV9 capsid, which preferentially transduces liver and heart. To further
improve transduction, all rAAVs were prepared as self-complementary (sc) genomes24. We
administered the vectors intravenously to adult male C57B/6 mice and monitored GLuc
activity in blood.

Author Manuscript

Initially, GLuc activity was comparable among the animals injected with vectors expressing
the miR-122-regulated reporters, irrespective of the presence of a TuD RNA expression
cassette (days 3 and 7). By week 2, GLuc activity declined in mice that received vectors
lacking the anti-miR-122 TuD, while it increased in mice treated with the anti-miR-122
TuD-expressing vector (Fig. 2d). Similarly, GLuc activity was low in mice that received the
let-7-regulated reporter and high in mice that received the same reporter containing the antilet-7 TuD cassette (Fig. 2e). One notable difference was that the let-7-regulated reporter was
silenced at the earliest time point (day 3), whereas the miR-122-regulated reporter showed
an initial lag (Fig. 2d,e); we do not currently understand the source of this difference. Derepression of GLuc expression by either anti-miR-122 or anti-let-7 TuD RNA was sustained
for the 25-week duration of the study, (Fig. 2d,e), during which we detected no significant
decrease in AAV genome copies (Supplementary Fig. 3).
scAAV9-delivered TuDs target miRNAs for destruction in mice

Author Manuscript

Four weeks after scAAV9 administration, we analyzed miRNA expression in the liver using
quantitative RT-PCR. We observed an ~80% reduction in miR-122 in mice that received the
anti-miR-122 TuD vector compared to anti-let-7 TuD or control lacking a TuD (Fig. 3a).
Northern hybridization confirmed the reduction of miR-122 in mice that received antimiR-122 TuD (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4). let-7 was similarly reduced in mice
treated with anti-let-7 TuD (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4). (Our let-7 northern probe
cannot distinguish among the 9 mouse let-7 isoforms.) In contrast, no reduction was detected
for miR-26a or miR-22, two abundant liver miRNAs (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4).

Author Manuscript

High-throughput sequencing of miRNAs from the treated livers further supports the view
that scAAV9-delivered TuDs effectively and specifically trigger the destruction of
complementary miRNAs. The TuD targeting miR-122 (Fig. 1b) reduced the abundance of
full-length, 23 nt miR-122 by 4.3-fold (Fig. 3c), consistent with our qRT-PCR results (Fig.
3a). The 21 and 22 nt miR-122 isoforms decreased less, whereas 20, 19 and 18 nt isoforms
increased, suggesting that the TuD triggered 3′-to-5′ exonucleolytic trimming of miR-122
(Fig. 3c). Like antagomir-directed destruction of miRNAs in cultured human cells19, the
anti-miR-122 TuD promoted the addition of non-templated nucleotides to the 3′ end of
miR-122 (Fig. 3d). Prefix-matching reads—sequences that initially match the mouse
genome but end with non-templated nucleotides—doubled in the anti-miR-122 TuD mouse
compared to the control (Fig. 3d). The 3′ non-templated nucleotides comprised one or more
adenosines. Even in the absence of the TuD, 21% of miR-122 was tailed with adenosine,

suggesting that miR-122 is modified after it binds to Argonaute proteins as part of its natural
turnover. Natural tailing of miR-122 is predominantly associated with the addition of a
single terminal, non-templated adenosine (89% of all non-templated nucleotides in the
control); TuD RNA increased the occurrence of terminal, non-templated adenosines from
3% to 11% for two adenosines and from 0.6% to 7% for three.

Mouse liver expresses nine let-7 isoforms (Supplementary Fig. 5). These differ by 1–4
nucleotides outside their common seed sequence (Fig. 3e). The TuD targeting let-7 most
strongly decreased the abundance of those full-length let-7 isoforms that were fully
complementary to the TuD sequence (let-7a, 12.1-fold) or contained only a single non-seed
mismatch (let-7c, 5.1-fold; let-7d, 5.0-fold; let-7f, 11.0-fold; and miR-98, 6.4-fold). In
contrast, the decrease was smaller for let-7b (1.6-fold) and let-7g (2.7-fold), both of which
contain two 3′ mismatches to the TuD, let-7i (1.5-fold), which contains three 3′ mismatches,
and let-7e (3.6-fold), which contains a purine:purine mismatch at position 9, immediately
flanking the seed sequence (Fig. 3e). Relative to genome-matching reads, prefix-matching
reads increased more for let-7a, c, d, and f and miR-98 (miR-98 is a let-7 isoform)—the let-7
isoforms that decreased the most in response to the anti-let-7 TuD—whereas let-7 b, e, g and
i, which decreased least, showed no increase in trimmed-and-tailed species (Fig. 3e). For
both the anti-miR-122 and anti-let-7 TuDs, the overall abundance of miRNAs was unaltered
(Supplementary Fig. 6). (We note that qRT-PCR, northern hybridization, and highthroughput sequencing report different apparent changes in miRNA levels upon TuD
expression, because each measures a different set of isoforms of the mature miRNA (Fig. 3,
Supplementary Fig. 7, and Supplementary Note 1).)

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our data suggest that TuDs act, at least in part, by targeting miRNAs for destruction by
recruiting the tailing and trimming pathway to decrease their steady-state abundance. An
alternative view is that the primary effect of highly abundant TuD RNA is to titrate miRNAs
away from their endogenous mRNA targets, whereas miRNA decay is a secondary effect.
To differentiate between these possibilities we transfected HuH-7 cells with a plasmid
expressing a TuD complementary to the entire miRNA (“all nucleotides”); to only the
miR-122 seed (nucleotides 2–8; “seed only”); or to the seed plus an additional region of
complementarity from nucleotides 12–15, a region previously shown to enhance miRNA
function25 (“seed + 3′ supplemental pairing”) (Fig. 4a). miRNA tailing and trimming
requires extensive complementarity between the miRNA and its target or AMO inhibitor19.
We monitored miRNA activity using an RLuc reporter bearing three miR-122 binding sites
(Fig. 4b). The fully complementary TuD efficiently de-repressed the miR-122-regulated
luciferase reporter achieving half-maximal inhibition (IC50) at 1.3 ± 0.2 ng transfected
plasmid. In contrast, we were unable to transfect sufficient plasmid to reach half-maximal
inhibition for the other TuD inhibitors; the seed only or the seed plus 3′ supplemental
pairing inhibitors were >60 times less effective than the fully complementary TuD.
Moreover, only the fully complementary TuD triggered the production of tailed and trimmed
miR-122 isoforms (Fig. 4c). We conclude that TuDs act, at least in part, by targeting
miRNAs for destruction via the tailing and trimming pathway.

TuDs delivered with scAAV9 increase expression of endogenous miRNA-regulated mRNAs

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

TuD inhibitors delivered using scAAV9 de-repressed miR-122- and let-7-regulated mRNAs
in vivo (Fig. 5). We used qRT-PCR (Fig. 5a) and western blotting (Fig. 5b and
Supplementary Fig. 8) to analyze the expression of known miR-122 and let-7 targets in liver
and heart four weeks after injection of the scAAV9 vectors. Mice injected with scAAV9
expressing the GLuc reporter but no TuD served as a control. For anti-miR-122 TuD-treated
mice, we detected in the liver a 2.5 to 4.2-fold increase in Aldolase A (3.3 ± 0.5; p-value <
0.04), Tmed3 (4.2 ± 1.5; p-value < 0.01), Hfe2 (3.3 ± 1.0; p-value < 0.02), and Cyclin G1
(2.5 ± 0.4; p-value < 0.001) mRNAs, all previously shown to be regulated by miR-122;
expression of these was unaltered in the heart, which lacks miR-122 (Fig. 5a). We found no
significant change in these four miR-122-regulated mRNAs in either liver or heart from
mice that received the vector expressing anti-let-7 TuD RNA (Fig. 5a). We also detected a
significant increase in Hfe2 (1.5 ± 0.1; p-value < 0.02) and Tmed3 (1.6 ± 0.1; p-value <
0.008) proteins in the livers of anti-miR-122 TuD-treated mice (Fig. 5b and Supplementary
Fig. 8).

Author Manuscript

The mRNA encoding the miRNA-producing enzyme Dicer is itself repressed by let-7. We
used qRT-PCR to measure Dicer mRNA abundance in mice that received scAAV9 vector
expressing either anti-miR-122 or anti-let-7 TuD RNA (Fig. 5a). When let-7 was inhibited,
Dicer mRNA increased in both liver (1.9 ± 0.2; p-value ≤ 0.001) and heart (2.4 ± 0.4; pvalue ≤ 0.003). Similarly, Dicer protein levels increased in the liver (2.0 ± 0.6; p-value <
0.05; Fig. 5b). (We did not examine protein levels in the heart.) The RAS family genes
Hras1, Nras and Kras have also been reported to be repressed by let-7. We detected
increased expression of Nras in both liver (1.3 ± 0.1; p-value ≤ 0.01) and heart (1.3 ± 0.1; pvalue ≤ 0.02) and of Hras1 (1.3 ± 0.1; p-value ≤ 0.04) in heart in anti-let-7-treated, but not
anti-miR-122 TuD–treated mice (Fig. 5a).
Anti-miR-122 TuD RNA reduces cholesterol levels

Author Manuscript

miR-122 is required for normal cholesterol biosynthesis; inhibition of miR-122 with AMOs
decreases cholesterol metabolism in adult mice5,8 and non-human primates6,7. In wild-type
mice, a single intravenous injection of scAAV9 expressing anti-miR-122 TuD significantly
reduced total serum cholesterol (45 ± 5%; p-value ≤ 0.001) and high-density lipoprotein
(HDL; 42 ± 5%; p-value ≤ 0.001) beginning two weeks after injection, and this reduction
was sustained for the 25-week duration of the study. LDL levels also decreased (88 ± 102%;
p-value ≤ 0.05) by the third week and remained depressed throughout the study (Fig. 6a).
Total serum cholesterol, HDL, and LDL levels were unaltered in mice that received the antilet-7 TuD. We detected no significant weight loss (Supplementary Fig. 9) or increase in
serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST; Fig. 6b) over the
course of 25 weeks.

are effective, but are currently expensive, require repeated dosing that risks long-term
toxicity, and many tissues are not currently accessible to delivery of oligonucleotides.
Transcribed miRNA-binding RNAs provide an alternative to oligonucleotides. Their small
size makes them readily incorporated into a variety of gene transfer vectors. Primate AAVderived vectors represent attractive tools for this application because of their unique tissue
tropism, high efficiency of transduction, stability of in vivo gene transfer, and low toxicity.

Author Manuscript

We compared several designs of miRNA antagonists in vitro, then used the most effective
design, TuDs, in vivo to inhibit miR-122 and let-7 by incorporating TuD expression
cassettes into scAAV9. A single administration of rAAV9 expressing a TuD RNA
efficiently depleted the targeted miRNA (Fig. 3) and increased the abundance of its
endogenous target mRNAs (Fig. 1 and 5), which in turn produced the predicted phenotypic
change in metabolism (Fig. 6).
Our data suggest that, in mice, TuD RNAs inhibit their miRNA targets via the target-RNA
directed tailing and trimming pathway19 (Fig. 3 and 4). This work, in addition to
observations in flies and cultured cells, suggests that the pathway is widely conserved
among animals. Targeted miRNA destruction triggered by TuDs was surprisingly sequencespecific for the nine distinct let-7 isoforms. Compared to let-7a, for which the TuD was fully
complementary, a single purine:purine mismatch between the TuD and let-7e reduced
miRNA degradation by >3-fold, and four mismatches (let-7i) reduced miRNA destruction 8fold. We are therefore optimistic that future studies will reveal the rules for designing TuD
inhibitors that target individual miRNA isoforms that differ by just one or two nucleotides.

Author Manuscript

The GLuc sensor system described here provides a simple means to detect changes in
specific miRNA function, such as those caused by miRNA inhibitors, in live adult mammals
across time (Fig. 2). This system allows one to assess the activity of a specific miRNA in a
cell line, tissue or organ, providing a quantitative measure of the effectiveness of a miRNA
antagonist.

Author Manuscript

Retrospective profiling has linked aberrant miRNA expression to a variety of diseases,
suggesting that miRNAs may provide new targets for therapy. Indeed, miR-122 inhibition
by AMOs5–8 or scAAV-delivered TuD RNA (Fig. 6) lowers both HDL and LDL. However,
the current view that HDL protects against heart attack argues that therapy for dyslipidemia
should lower LDL but raise HDL levels. Recently, miR-33 was identified as a repressor of
HDL biogenesis; miR-33 inhibition raises serum HDL level18. Perhaps simultaneous
inhibition of miR-122 and miR-33 by a pair of TuD RNAs expressed from a single scAAV
vector may achieve a more balanced and healthy cholesterol profile and provide long-lasting
therapy for familial hypercholesterolemia.
Low miR-122 levels have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in rodents and
humans26–28, although no direct causal link has been established27,28. Because AAV vector
expression is stable for years in rodents and primates, animals treated with scAAV9
expressing anti-miR-122 should enable testing the safety of prolonged miR-122 inhibition in
general and the increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in particular.

Comparison of miR-122 inhibitor strategies in cultured cells. (a) miRNA inhibitor
constructs. (b) Pairing of inhibitors (black) to miR-122 (red). (c) Plasmid harboring nLacZ
reporter gene with one or three sites complementary to miR-122 was co-transfected into
HuH-7 cells with pTBG-driven firefly luciferase (FLuc) and either control, anti-miR-122
sponge or U6-driven anti-miR-122 TuD plasmid. The cells were stained for nLacZ
expression 48 h after transfection, and the proportion of blue cells were counted and
reported relative to a control reporter lacking miR-122-binding sites. n = 3 independent
experiments. (d) Reporter plasmid expressing nLacZ mRNA containing 3 miR-122-binding
sites was cotransfected into HuH-7 cells with a U6-driven sponge-, miRZip-, TuDexpressing, or empty (control) plasmid. n = 4 . (e) HEK 293 cells were transfected with an
nLacZ reporter plasmid containing three fully complementary miR-122-binding sites
together with constructs expressing anti-let-7 or anti-miR-122 TuD transcribed from a U6
promoter or anti-miR-122 sponge or anti-let-7 sponge transcribed from an SV40 promoter,
as well as different amounts of a plasmid producing pri-miR-122 RNA. Percentages of
nLacZ positive cells relative to the control (nLacZ without miR-122-binding sites), were
determined after 48 h (c, d, and e). n = 3. (f) HuH-7 cells were transfected with plasmid
expressing control Renilla reniformis luciferase (RLuc) and FLuc bearing seven miR-122binding sites or seven mutant sites; these were either alone or in the presence of plasmid
expressing anti-miR-122, anti-let-7 or a scrambled TuD RNA control. Luciferase activity
was assayed after 24 h and is presented as the mean ratio of RLuc to Fluc ± s.d. (n = 3). (g

Analysis of miRNA expression in liver from mice administered scAAV9 expressing antimiRNA TuD. C57BL/6J mice were injected via tail vein with 1 × 1012 genome copies of
control, anti-miR-122 or anti-let-7 TuD expressing vectors. Animals were sacrificed four
weeks later, and the abundance of let-7, miR-122, miR-26a, miR-22 and U6 in total liver
RNA was measured by qRT-PCR (a; n = 3 per group) and northern hybridization (b; n = 4
per group). Values are mean ± s.d. U6 RNA provided a loading control. (c, d) Highthroughput sequencing of total liver small RNA was used to determine the length and
abundance of genome-matching (c) or prefix-matching (d) miR-122 isoforms four weeks
after injection. The most abundant non-genome matching nucleotides added to the 3′ end of
miR-122 fragments are indicated in the grey boxes.2(e) Nucleotide differences among the
nine let-7 paralogs expressed in liver are indicated in black and their pairing to the TuD
RNA is shown. The seed sequence, which determines miRNA target specificity, is
underlined. The TuD targeting let-7 decreased the abundance of full-length let-7 and
increased the abundance of prefix-matching let-7 sequence reads relative to the control.
Isoforms are shown in black whose genome-matching reads decreased and whose prefixmatching reads increased. MM: total number of mismatches between each let-7 paralog and
the TuD.
