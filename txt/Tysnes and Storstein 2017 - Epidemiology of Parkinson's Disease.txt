Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects 1–2 per 1000 of
the population at any time. PD prevalence is increasing
with age and PD affects 1% of the population above
60 years. The main neuropathological finding is a-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies and loss of dopaminergic
neurons in the substantia nigra, manifesting as reduced
facilitation of voluntary movements. With progression of
PD, Lewy body pathology spreads to neocortical and cortical regions. PD is regarded as a movement disorder with
three cardinal signs: tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. A
recent revision of the diagnostic criteria excludes postural
instability as a fourth hallmark and defines supportive
criteria, absolute exclusion criteria and red flags. Nonmotor symptoms in PD have gained increasing attention
and both motor and non-motor signs are now included
among the supportive criteria. The cause of PD is unknown
in most cases. Genetic risk factors have been identified,
including monogenetic causes that are rare in unselected
populations. Some genetic factor can be identified in
5–10% of the patients. Several environmental factors are
associated with increased risk of PD. Autopsy studies show
that the clinical diagnosis of PD is not confirmed at autopsy
in a significant proportion of patients. Revised diagnostic
criteria are expected to improve the cliniciańs accuracy in
diagnosing PD. Increasing knowledge on genetic and
environmental risk factors of PD will probably elucidate
the cause of this disease within the near future.

Summary
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by its main motor
symptoms bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, but also have
additional motor and non-motor characteristics. The onset
of the disease is usually at an age of 65 to 70 years. Onset
before the age of 40 is seen in less than 5% of the cases in
population-based cohorts. Earlier onset is seen in genetic
variants. Monogenetic forms of PD are probably rare in
unselected populations, but may be frequent in some ethnic
groups. In general, genetic factors are thought to be
involved in 5–10% of the cases, may be more. The disease
is slightly more frequent in men than women. The prevalence of the disease is generally accepted to range from 100
to 200 per 100,000 people and the annual incidence is
thought to be 15 per 100,000. There is an ongoing discussion whether there is increasing occurrence of the disease, exceeding what can be expected in an ageing
population.

Introduction
PD is the most common movement disorder and represents
the second most common degenerative disease of the
central nervous system. The disease was originally
described by James Parkinson in his ‘‘Essay on the shaking
palsy’’ from 1817, carefully outlining the major motor
signs of the disease that are still considered the hallmarks
of PD; bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. In addition,
mental symptoms of the disease were also noted.

PD is characterized neuropathologically by the presence
of a-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies in the substantia
nigra of the brain. Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the pars
compacta of the substantia nigra leads to reduced facilitation of voluntary movements. a-synuclein accumulation
becomes more widespread in the brain during the progression of PD (Braak et al. 2003) and over the last
10–20 years non-motor symptoms in PD have been given
considerable attention (Garcia-Ruiz et al. 2014). Nevertheless, the motor signs of the disease making PD a
movement disorder, still represent the hallmarks of the
disease and are the most important characteristics for a
diagnosis of PD, even today with modern imaging or laboratory tests to help with the diagnostic challenge.

absence of progression, early bulbar dysfunction, inspiratory respiratory dysfunction (most frequently seen in
MSA), severe autonomic failure during the first year of the
disease, recurrent falls due to reduced balance, early
antecollis, pyramidal tract signs, bilateral symmetric
parkinsonism throughout the disease course and absence of
any of the common non-motor features seen in PD like
sleep dysfunction, autonomic dysfunction or hyposmia.
The new diagnostic criteria for PD will most probably
improve the diagnostic accuracy to achieve a better concordance between the clinical diagnosis and the neuropathologically confirmed disease.

Prevalence and incidence of PD
Diagnosis of PD
PD was originally considered a pure movement disorder
with three cardinal signs: tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia.
Over the years postural changes in general and postural
instability in particular was used as a fourth cardinal sign
(Gelb et al. 1999). During the 1990s it became apparent
that a considerable proportion of cases with a clinical
diagnosis of PD did not fulfill histopathological PD criteria
at autopsy, even at the most experienced hands. At best
only 80% of cases clinically defined as PD met the criteria
for the disease at autopsy (Larsen et al. 1994; Tolosa et al.
2006). Defined diagnostic criteria of PD, like the UK Brain
Bank Criteria (Hughes et al. 2001), increased the accuracy,
but even after clinical observation over years, as used in
these criteria, cases with diagnostic uncertainty remain
(Rizzo et al. 2016).
Recently the clinical diagnostic criteria for PD were
revised (Postuma et al. 2015a). Bradykinesia, rigidity and
rest tremor are still highlighted as cardinal signs of the
disease. The obligate symptom of bradykinesia must occur
in combination with rest tremor, rigidity or both. However,
postural changes, and especially postural instability, are
left out. The new diagnostic criteria define supportive criteria, absolute exclusion criteria and red flags. A diagnosis
of ‘‘clinically established PD’’ requires at least two supportive criteria, the absence of absolute exclusion criteria,
and no red flags. The supportive criteria include both motor
and non-motor aspects of the disease, namely effect of
dopaminergic therapy, presence of levodopa-induced
dyskinesia, asymmetric rest tremor and positive tests on
cardiac sympathetic denervation or olfactory loss. Absolute
exclusion criteria are cerebellar abnormalities, supra
nuclear gaze palsy, frontotemporal cognitive changes, slow
progression, use of anti-dopaminergic therapy, absence of
levodopa response, cortical findings like apraxia, and normal DAT scan. Red flags are early gait impairment,

Several studies report data on the epidemiology of PD.
However, methodological differences between studies make
direct comparison of prevalence estimates difficult. It is
generally accepted that the prevalence of the disease range
from 1 to 2 per 1000 in unselected populations (von Campenhausen et al. 2005) and that the disease affects 1% of the
population above 60 years (de Lau and Breteler 2006). PD is
rare before age of 50 years and reaches a prevalence of 4%
in the highest age groups (de Rijk et al. 1995, 2000).
The incidence of the disease varies considerably in
different reports. This is probably due to methodological
differences, in particular differences in case ascertainment
and use of diagnostic criteria. The annual incidence per
100,000 inhabitants ranges from less than 10 to more than
20. Incidence studies may be affected by under-diagnosing
of PD, especially among the most elderly.
The public health care system in the Nordic countries is
well organized and the population is very stable. Few people
move to other regions of the country when they reach the
age of increasing risk of PD. In the Park West study (Alves
et al. 2009) medical files of MDs in general practice (GP)
were scanned for cases diagnosed as PD. We identified no
cases of PD in the GP’s files that were not already included
in the study. The annual incidence of the disease was calculated to 13.5/100,000. Only 8 cases (3%) of the 265
identified PD patients during the inclusion period were
younger than 50 years of age (Alves et al. 2009). The
NYPUM study in Umeå in Sweden reports a thorough
evaluation of PD in the very oldest age group (Linder et al.
2010). This study reported an annual incidence of 18.8 cases
per 100,000 and a mean age of onset at 70.6 years, slightly
above the mean age of onset that we reported from Norway.
Early-onset of PD is rare in population-based studies. Only
4% of patients develop cardinal signs of PD before the age
of 50 (Van Den Eeden et al. 2003).
An important question is whether there is an actual
increase in PD prevalence and incidence. Already in 2000

Epidemiology of Parkinson’s disease

we reported that there was an increasing occurrence in
neurodegenerative disease like ALS and PD in Norway
(Seljeseth et al. 2000). Most of the increase could be
attributed to the general increase in age of the population.
However, recently published data support an increase in
risk of PD, especially in men. It was hypothesized that the
increase in risk of PD could be related to the dramatic
changes in smoking behavior that has been taken place
during the last part of the twentieth century (Savica et al.
2016b). Increased occurrence of PD has also been related
to increase in traffic-related air pollution (Lee et al. 2016).
However, other reports have not been able to demonstrate
an increased risk of PD (Rocca et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2016).

Heterozygous GBA mutations, a-synuclein variants and
tau variants are examples of genetic risk factors for PD
(Rana et al. 2013; Kalia and Lang 2015). Well-known
environmental risk factors of PD may attribute to genetic
risk factors to influence the general risk of the disease.
Cigarette smoking, alcohol, vitamin D exposure and urate
levels are examples of environmental factors that may
influence the risk of disease, in addition to acknowledged
and unknown genetic factors (Kalia and Lang 2015).
However, some data also indicate that the influence of
environmental factors may be less important (Bellou et al.
2016).

Presymptomatic PD
Etiology
The cause of PD is unknown for most identified cases. Over
the last years genetic risk factors have been identified. First
degree family members of affected patients have a 2- to
3-fold increased risk to develop the disease compared to
subjects in the general population or controls (Sveinbjornsdottir et al. 2000; Savica et al. 2016a). Monogenetic causes
of PD have been identified, but were considered very rare
until the identification of leucine-rich repeat kinase
(LRRK2) mutations (Gilks et al. 2005) that in selected
populations cause up to 40% of the cases (Lesage and Brice
2012). It is generally considered that known genetic causes
may be relevant in more than 5% of the total PD population
and that monogenetic causes are rare, but some propose that
monogenetic causes may be involved in as many as 5–10%
of the PD population (Lill 2016). Monogenetic forms of PD
may differ from sporadic PD both pathologically and clinically. The exception is the LRRK2 mutation which to a high
degree resembles sporadic PD with asymmetric onset and
frequent tremor. LRRK2 PD is, as sporadic PD, heterogeneous with respect to progression and occurrence of nonmotor symptoms. PD associated with SNCA mutation is
more early-onset, has a moderate response to levodopa with
more rapid progression, and pyramidal signs, psychiatric
symptoms and cognitive decline are frequently evident. The
recessive PD forms are typically early-onset cases with good
response to levodopa and early development of dyskinesias.
Cognitive impairment is relatively uncommon (Thenganatt
and Jankovic 2014).
The Norwegian Park West study is a population-based
study and included 212 patients of a total of 265 identified
PD cases (Alves et al. 2009). All patients included in the
study were exome-sequenced. Only one patient had a
monogenetic form of the disease (LRRK2) (Gaare et al.
2016). Monogenetic forms of PD are probably rare in
unselected general populations. In addition to monogenetic
forms of PD, genetic risk factors have been identified.

During the last few years, there has been a considerable
interest in prodromal signs of PD. Constipation was early
identified as a risk factor of PD (Abbott et al. 2001). Less
than 1 bowel movement per day represented a 2.7-fold
increase in risk of PD. These data have recently been
confirmed in a Danish study showing clearly increased risk
of PD in patients with a previous diagnosis of constipation
(Svensson et al. 2016) and are also reported in other studies
(Stirpe et al. 2016). Hyposmia (Haehner et al. 2007) and
REM-sleep behavior disorder (Jankovic et al. 2015) are
considered to be particularly associated with the risk of
later clinical PD. RBD may in more than 50% of cases end
up as a form of synucleinopathy and especially PD, after 10
to 20 years of observation (Postuma et al. 2015b). There is
still a lack of studies to give a more precise idea on the risk
of PD in individuals with symptoms that could be
prodromal.

Conclusions
PD represents a frequent cause of morbidity that affects
1–2 per 1000 of the population at any time, clearly most
often in the older age groups. It affects men slightly more
frequently than women. There may be an increase in
occurrence of the disease that cannot be explained by
demographic changes of the population alone. Revised
diagnostic criteria are expected to improve the clinical
diagnostic accuracy. Increasing knowledge on the genetic
risk factors of PD together with data on environmental risk
factors will probably increase the understanding of the
cause of the disease within the near future.
