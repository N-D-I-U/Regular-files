Background: miRNAs may play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. It is necessary to
continue the search for new miRNAs that may affect the development of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease.
Methods: 20 untreated patients with Parkinson's disease and 18 treated patients with Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr scores 1e2) were studied. An analysis of the levels of 11 miRNAs in the peripheral
blood lymphocytes of patients was carried out using reverse transcription followed by real-time PCR.
Results: The levels of miR-7, miR-9-3p, miR-9-5p, miR-129, and miR-132 were increased by more than
three times in treated patients with Parkinson's disease compared with those of the controls.
Conclusions: It is probable that miRNAs are very sensitive to drug therapy and that the effects of therapy
observed may be associated with changes in the levels of these miRNAs and their target genes in patients
with Parkinson's disease.

1. Introduction
It has been shown that miRNAs are frequently deregulated in
human diseases, suggesting that they could serve as possible targets or potential biomarkers for development of miRNA-based
therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, heart failure, atherosclerosis and HCV infection [1e4]. There is evidence that microRNAs
(miRNAs) may be involved in the Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis [5e8].
A signiﬁcant reduction in the level of miR-133b compared with
healthy controls was shown in the study of the expression proﬁle of
224 miRNA precursors in the brains of patients with PD [9].
Moreover, several studies performed using various model objects
have shown that miRNAs may be associated with the development
of neurodegeneration in PD [5,10]. However, there is evidence of
decreasing in the levels of miR-1, miR-22*, and miR-29a in the
peripheral blood of patients with PD [11].
Thus, it is necessary to continue the search for new miRNAs that
may affect the development of neurodegeneration in PD. In this
regard, we have analyzed changes in the levels of 11 miRNAs in the

peripheral blood of patients in the early stages of PD. These miRNAs
are preferentially expressed in the brain and may play a role in the
pathogenesis of PD.
2. Methods
Two groups of patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr score of 1e2) were studied: 20
untreated patients with PD and 18 treated patients with PD. The mean age ± SD at
disease onset was 54.4 ± 7.6 years (46.8e62), and the mean age at the enrollment
was 55.6 ± 7.6 years (47.8e63). Sex ratio was about 1:1 in groups of patients with PD.
The form of PD was predominantly mixed.
Patients with PD had no severe concomitant diseases, such as severe cardiovascular disease, cancer, or diabetes mellitus. Treated patients with PD received
different medications (dopamine receptor agonists: pramipexole in a dosage of
1.5 mg/day or piribedil in a dosage of 150 mg/day, L-dopa in a dosage of
150e200 mg/day, amantadine in a dosage of 300 mg/day), either as monotherapy or
in various combinations.
The following individuals were included in two control groups: the neurological
control group consisted of 21 patients with different neurological disorders
(amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, CharcoteMarieeTooth disease, Wilson's disease,
cerebellar ataxia, etc.), whereas the control group consisted of 24 neurologically
healthy volunteers who were matched to the patients regarding sex, age, and
ethnicity.
All patients (Russians residing in the European part of Russia) were diagnosed
with PD at the Research Center of Neurology. All patients with PD were selected and
studied according to the international Uniﬁed Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and
Hoehn and Yahr scores [12,13]. The diagnosis of PD was based on the UK PD Brain
Bank Criteria [14].

All blood samples were collected with the informed consent of the persons
investigated. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Research
Center of Neurology.
miRNA isolation was performed from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Isolation of
lymphocytes from the whole blood was carried out using Ficoll-Urograﬁn (DNA
Technology, Moscow, Russia). After that fraction containing RNA was isolated from
lymphocytes using TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). miRNA isolation
from this fraction was performed using the mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). miRNA concentration was measured using a Quant-iT RNA BR
Assay Kit and a Qubit ﬂuorimeter (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All procedures
were carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
The analysis of miRNA levels was performed using reverse transcription followed by real-time PCR using TaqMan probes. Reverse transcription was carried out
using the MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). Analysis of levels of miR-7, miR-9-5p, miR-9-3p, miR-129, miR-132, miR-133b,
miR-153, miR-191, miR-346, miR-433, miR-598 and housekeeping RNAs snRNA U6,
snRNA U44 and snRNA U47 was carried out using the Custom TaqMan® Gene
Expression Assay and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). Real-time PCR was using StepOnePlus™ System (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). All procedures were carried out in accordance with the
manufacturer's recommendations. Each blood sample was analyzed in three independent runs for corrections of differences in sample quality and reverse transcription efﬁciency.
Relative levels of miRNAs were in the test groups were calculated as R ¼ 2eDDCp
[15]. The levels of the miRNAs studied in the group of healthy controls were set as 1.
Data were analyzed using the nonparametric ManneWhitney U test with “Statistica
for Windows 8.0” (StatSoft, Inc. (2007)) and MS Excel 2010 (Microsoft).

3. Results
The results of the analysis of the levels of 11 miRNAs are shown
in Table 1.
In the ﬁrst stage of our study, we analyzed changes in the miRNA
levels in the groups of patients with PD and healthy volunteers.
miRNAs that exhibited levels that differed signiﬁcantly in the patients with PD compared with the control group underwent additional analysis in the neurological control group to assess the
speciﬁcity of the changes observed in PD (Table 1).
Signiﬁcant increases in the levels of miR-7, miR-9-5p, miR-9-3p,
miR-129, and miR-132 were identiﬁed in untreated patients with
PD. It should be noted that no difference was observed in miRNA
levels between the neurological control group and the healthy
volunteers, which may indicate the speciﬁcity of the changes of the
miRNA levels observed during neurodegeneration in PD.
4. Discussion
The most pronounced change of miRNA levels was observed in
treated patients with PD. The levels of miR-9-3p, miR-129, and
miR-132 were increased by more than three times, those of miR-95p was increased by six times, and those of miR-7 was increased

by 32 times in treated patients with Parkinson's disease compared
with those of the healthy controls (Table 1). Our data are consistent with the data reported by Margis and coworkers [11], who
showed that the use of levodopa treatment led to a change in the
expression proﬁle of several miRNAs. Furthermore, it was shown,
that several non-coding RNAs change their expression in leucocytes of patients with PD after deep brain stimulation treatment
[10,16]. It is probable that miRNAs are very sensitive to the therapy
and that the effects of therapy observed may be associated with
changes in the levels of these miRNAs and their target genes in
patients with PD.
