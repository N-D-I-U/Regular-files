The interplay of transcription factors, histone modifiers, and
DNA modification can alter chromatin structure that epigenetically controls gene transcription. During severe systemic
inflammatory (SSI), the generation of facultative heterochromatin from euchromatin reversibly silences transcription of a set of
acute proinflammatory genes. This gene-specific silencing is a
salient feature of the endotoxin tolerant phenotype that is found
in blood leukocytes of SSI patients and in a human THP-1 cell
model of SSI. We previously reported that de novo induction of
the NF-␬B transcription factor RelB by endotoxin activation is
necessary and sufficient for silencing transcription of acute
proinflammatory genes in the endotoxin tolerant SSI phenotype. Here, we examined how RelB silences gene expression and
found that RelB induces facultative heterochromatin formation
by directly interacting with the histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase G9a. We found that heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and
G9a formed a complex at the interleukin-1␤ promoter that is
dependent on the Rel homology domain (RHD) of RelB. RelB
knockdown disassociated the complex and reversed transcription silencing. We also observed that whereas RelB chromatin
binding was independent of G9a, RelB transcriptional silencing
required G9a accumulation at the silenced promoter. Binding
between RelB and G9a was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown in vitro and coimmunoprecipitation in vivo. These
data provide novel insight into how RelB is required to initiate
silencing in the phenotype associated with severe systemic
inflammation in humans, a disease with major morbidity and
mortality.

Inflammation is an evolutionarily conserved stereotypic
stress response primarily orchestrated by temporal alterations
in gene expression, with important contributions from complement, coagulation, and neurogenic processes (1, 2). The genetic
information encoded to generate inflammation regulates distinct functional sets of genes, including pro- and anti-inflammatory modifiers, directors of cell death, and mediators of cell

respiration and metabolism (3). The initiating stage of virtually
all inflammation depends on sensory receptors coupled to
intracellular signals that activate the immunity master regulator NF-␬B to generate p65 and p50 transactivating heterodimers at euchromatin promoters of a set of early response
proinflammatory genes. When spread throughout the circulation, this early stage may precipitate the extreme stress response of severe systemic inflammation (SSI).4 Later stages of
inflammation reprogramming often require protein synthesis
and induce expression of distinct sets of genes with anti-inflammatory, survival, and energy regulation (4, 5). Recent data in
humans from our laboratory and in animals from others highlight the role of epigenetics in regulating gene expression in the
SSI phenotype (6 –11). These epigenetic events provide specificity and plasticity among distinct sets of genes and depend on
varied chromatin structure and modifications rather than distinct signaling pathways.
Chromatin exists in structural forms that provide access of
DNA to transcription factors in responsive euchromatin and
mask access to the transcriptional apparatus in compacted heterochromatin (12). Facultative heterochromatin defines chromatin that can switch between open euchromatin and compacted heterochromatin (13). The mechanisms that control
compaction and de-compaction of facultative heterochromatin
to influence phenotypes through epigenetic control of gene
expression are poorly defined but involve the cooperative interplay of transcription factors and modifiers of nucleosomal histones and DNA (12, 14).
Regulation of chromatin structure through covalent and
non-covalent histone modifications is critical for epigenetically
regulating gene expression across the genome (15). Histone
lysine methylation participates in various chromatin-associating functions, including transcriptional regulation, heterochromatin formation, DNA repair, and recombination (16,
17). G9a is a major mammalian methyltransferase responsible for mono- and dimethylation of histone H3K9 at euchromatin regions (18). Dimethylated H3K9 contributes to binding
of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and transition of accessible

RelB Interacts with G9a to Silence Transcription
(open) euchromatin to compacted (closed) and transcriptionally silenced facultative heterochromatin (13). We and others
reported that epigenetic alterations generate gene-specific control of SSI by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) induces chromatin
modifications in blood leukocytes and lung dendritic cells
(6 –11). These chromatin modifications are associated with
reversibly silencing one class of genes, which includes proinflammatory mediators, and sustaining or accentuating transcription activation of other classes of genes, including antiinflammatory and anti-microbial mediators (3). The epigenetic
transcription silencing of acute proinflammatory genes
requires G9a-dependent dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9,
recruitment of HP-1, CpG methylation of DNA, and assembly
of H1 linker histone and high mobility group Box 1 (HMGB1)
(7–9).
Information is limited on the nature of the molecular bridge
between the transcription factors and epigenetic determinants.
We discovered that de novo induction of NF-␬B transcription
factor RelB after TLR4 stimulation is necessary and sufficient
for silencing transcription of TNF␣ and IL-1␤ in the SSI phenotype (8, 19). We also found that RelB can function in the same
cell type as a dual transcription regulator in the SSI phenotype
to deactivate transcription of acute proinflammatory genes
while activating transcription of the NF-␬B regulator I␬B␣ (20).
RelB also participates in constitutive silencing of inflammatory
genes in fibroblasts by a process that supports regional methylation of CpG DNA (21), and when normally silenced fibroblasts are rendered RelB⫺/⫺, they become responsive to LPS
(22).
In this study, we examined how RelB couples to epigenetically silence expression of acute proinflammatory genes and
found that RelB initiates facultative heterochromatin formation by interacting with the histone H3 lysine methyltransferase
G9a, which then mediates heterochromatin formation.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Culture Model of SSI—THP-1 cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection were maintained in RPMI 1640
medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 units/ml penicillin
G, 10 ␮g/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10% fetal
bovine serum (HyClone) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified
incubator. LPS-mediated tolerance that mimics the SSI phenotype in THP-1 cells was previously described (23). Briefly,
LPS tolerance is generated by an initial stimulation with LPS
(0111:B4; 1 ␮g/ml) for 16 h followed by re-stimulation with
1.0 ␮g/ml LPS for 3 h. This LPS acts exclusively through TLR4
receptor as determined in cells lacking TLR4. High concentrations
of LPS are used to optimize the tolerant phenotype, although
changes occur with doses as low as 10–100 ng/ml. Tolerance
occurs within 3 h and sustains for at least 96 h (3). Normal and LPS
tolerant THP-1 cells (1 ⫻ 106 cells/sample) were washed once with
RPMI 1640, re-suspended in fetal bovine serum supplemented
RPMI 1640 medium at 1 ⫻ 106 cells/ml, and stimulated with LPS 1
␮g/ml for 3 h. Low passage number and log-phase cells were used
for all experiments.

(Upstate Biotechnology) were performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions with the following modifications.
Cells (5 ⫻ 106 cells/sample) were fixed by adding formaldehyde
(from a 37% formaldehyde, 10% methanol stock (Calbiochem))
into the medium for a final formaldehyde concentration of 1%
and incubated at room temperature for 10 min with gentle
shaking. The chromatin was disrupted by sonication using a
Diagenode Bioruptor (UCD-200TM-EX, Tosho Denk1 Co.,
Ltd). High power sonification (30 s on and 30 s off for 23 min) at
this setting generated DNA fragments of ⬃0.5–1.5 kilobases.
Each sample was divided into two parts, providing an “input”
sample that was not incubated with antibodies. The other portion was incubated overnight with antibodies specific for p65
(SC-372), p50 (SC-7178), RelB (SC-226), HP1 (SC-10215), and
IgG (SC-2027) for the negative control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and G9a (07–551) (Upstate Biotechnology). Purified DNA was re-suspended in 10 ␮l of distilled H2O.
Co-immunoprecipitation (IP) ChIP—The method of co-IP
ChIP was performed according to a previous report (24). In
brief, cells were fixed and chromatin-sheared as above. Immunoprecipitation was conducted with IgG, anti-RelB, or antiG9a and 30 ␮l of protein A/G-agarose beads (50% slurry, Santa
Cruz, SC-2003) with rotation overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were eluted by incubation with 10 mM dithiothreitol at
37 °C for 30 min and diluted 1:50 in IP dilution buffer. Elutes
were then re-immunoprecipitated with second antibodies.
Purified DNA was resuspended in 10 ␮l of distilled H2O.
Real-time PCR—The chromatin-immunoprecipitated DNA
for each treatment was analyzed quantitatively for the amplification of the IL-1␤ promoter using specific primers (forward,
5⬘-cgtgggaaaatccagtattttaatg-3⬘, and reverse, 5⬘-caaatgtatcaccatgcaaatatgc-3⬘) and probe (5⬘-6-carboxyfluorescein-acatcaactgcacaacgattgtcaggaaaa-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine3⬘) (Applied Biosystems) as we used before. The real-time PCR
reaction (total 25 ␮l) contained 3 ␮l of DNA, 12.5 ␮l of 2⫻TaqMan Universal Master Mix, 300 nM concentrations of each
primer, and 100 nM dNTPs. The real-time PCR procedure was 2
min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles with 15 s
at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C using the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Data were normalized
to the input DNA and are presented as -fold change relative to
DNA from untreated cells.
To measure IL-1␤ mRNA, total RNA was isolated at various
times after LPS stimulation using RNA STAT-60, according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). One
microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA in a 20-␮l
volume containing 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dNTP, 2.5 ␮M oligo(dT),
and 2.5 units/␮l murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase
(Applied Biosystems). The PCR was performed using 4 ␮l of
cDNA, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-predesigned TaqMan primer/probe kits (Applied Biosystems)
under the conditions described above. Data were normalized to
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA and are
presented as -fold change relative to mRNA from untreated
cells.
Standard PCR—A standard PCR reaction (total 25 ␮l) containing 2 ␮l of ChIP DNA, 1 ␮M concentrations of each primer

Taq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) was performed to confirm the results of real-time PCR. The procedure
was 1 cycle at 94 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 55 °C 30 s, and 72 °C
for 30 s each plus a final cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR
products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels, and images were
captured using Quantity One Imager (Bio-Rad).
Western Blot—Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic protein was
assayed by Western blot. The methods for protein extraction are
the same as we used before (19). RelB, G9a, HP1, p65, p50, and HA
antibodies (Santa Cruz) were used to visualize and quantify protein levels using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare).
RNA Interference—Pools of control (SC-37007), RelB-specific (SC-36402), G9a-specific (SC-43777), and HP1-specific
(SC-37737) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; Santa Cruz) were
transfected by electroporation with 8 ␮l (0.5 ␮M) of siRNA in
100 ␮l of transfection medium (Nucleofector; Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) as previously described (19). Each pool included
three siRNA sequences that specifically target different
sequence of the target gene to ensure specific knockdown. To
check for off-target effects by siRNA, our previous experiments
indicated that the expression of other inflammatory proteins,
like I␬B␣ and p65, is not affected by the introduction of these
siRNA species into tolerant cells. In addition, Western blot data
confirm that RelB or G9a knockdown by siRNA did not affect
the expression of the reciprocal gene. Thus, no off-target effects
have been identified. Immediately after transfection, cells were
left unstimulated or treated with 1 ␮g/ml LPS to induce tolerance. After 48 h, cells were harvested, washed, and stimulated
for 3 h with 1 ␮g/ml LPS. Cells were harvested, and RNA was
isolated and used to determine the IL-1␤ mRNA expression
levels.
Immunoprecipitation—In vivo binding of G9a and RelB was
assayed by IP. Cells (⬃30 ⫻ 106) were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and washed with PBS. Then the cell
pellet was suspended in EBS lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 120
mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation of cell lysates (15
min, 14,000 ⫻ g, 4 °C), samples of supernatant termed ‘‘cell
extract” were used for IP. Samples of total extract (1 mg of
protein) plus 4 ␮g of G9a antibody (ab40542-100), RelB antibody (ab33907-100) (Abcam Biotechnology) or normal rabbit
IgG (SC-2027) (Santa Cruz), and 40 ␮l of protein A/G beads
(50% slurry, Santa Cruz, SC-2003) were incubated at 4 °C overnight with agitation. Beads were washed 6 times with NETN
buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 900 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) then washed once with NETN buffer with 100 mM
NaCl before elution (95 °C, 5 min) of bound proteins in 100 ␮l
of gel-loading buffer. Samples of eluted proteins were assayed
Western blot and incubated with RelB or G9a antibody followed by appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and Super Signal Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Procedures used for IP and Western blotting
were identical in all experiments with quantities adjusted for
scale of each. All observations were replicated at least three
times.
Plasmid Construction—It has been shown that the C-terminal part of the Rel homology domain (between amino acids 264
and 379) is essential for effective RelB dimerization (25). RelB

nuclear levels of the protein may provide the rate-limiting step
for silencing.
RelB-dependent Silencing Is Mediated by G9a—Because RelB
is both necessary and sufficient for transcription silencing (19)
and because the data in this study thus far supported a RelB-dependent proximal process, we determined whether the transcription silencing activity of RelB is mediated by a link to G9a.
To test this we used G9a-specific siRNA to deplete G9a protein,
a process that did not substantially alter RelB or HP1 protein
levels as assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4A). We then
assessed whether depletion of G9a by siRNA would reverse
silencing, as determined by mRNA analysis with control siRNA
versus G9a siRNA. Fig. 4B shows that responsivity of the promoter to LPS stimulation of IL-1␤ mRNA is restored in the G9a
knockdown. To determine the effect of the G9a knockdown on
occupancy of the promoter by RelB and HP1 in the presence of
reductions in G9a and reversal of transcription silencing, we
used ChIP analysis. The results in Fig. 4C support that RelB
remains bound to the IL-1␤ promoter (although at lower levels)
after G9a knockdown, whereas HP1 and G9a are removed. This
indicates that RelB silencing activity likely requires G9a-dependent modifications of chromatin.
In the reverse experiment we knocked down HP1 by siRNA
and measured RelB and G9a binding to the promoter. The
results (Fig. 4D) showed no decrease both in RelB and G9a
binding after HP1 depletion, suggesting that their assembly at
the IL-1␤ promoter is proximal to HP1 binding.
RelB and G9a Co-immunoprecipitate in Vivo in Silenced
Cells and Directly Interact in Vitro—To test whether RelB and
G9a proteins might directly interact, we used a series of coimmunoprecipitations. In vivo assessments included co-immunoprecipitations of native proteins in silenced cells and of normal cells transfected with the wild type HA-RelB. RelB and G9a
were used as both primary and secondary antibodies in the in
vivo assays. In vitro interactions of RelB and G9a were analyzed
using GST pulldown assays. Both the N and C termini of G9a
were linked to GST as fusion proteins. Fig. 5, A and B, show that
RelB and G9a co-immunoprecipitate with primary or secondary antibodies after transfection of HA RelB and in silenced
cells in the native state. This supports that RelB and G9a couple
in vivo either directly or indirectly. Fig. 5B shows that in vitro
translated RelB directly interacts with GST-linked G9a in vitro
and that this interaction predominates at the N terminus
(1–500 amino acids) of G9a. GST vector and resin alone controls were negative. The co-immunoprecipitation experiments
were repeated three times under each condition. Together
these data support that RelB can initiate silencing by directly
binding to G9a, which mediates formation of facultative heterochromatin, as indicated by the presence of HP1 (13).

DISCUSSION
This is the first report on a mechanism responsible for the
link between an NF-␬B family member and the epigenetic
events that condense chromatin to heterochromatin via a link
to a lysine methyltransferase and heterochromatin protein 1.
These data provide novel insight into how RelB initiates silencing in the phenotype associated with severe systemic inflammation in humans, a disease with major morbidity and mortality.

Silencing is dependent on the de
novo induction of RelB by TLR4
activation. The data support a direct
interaction of RelB with the methyltransferase G9a, which through dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine
9 (H3K9) generates a stable binding
site for HP1 chromatin adapter protein and supports a switch in the histone code from active to silenced
transcription (26). We further show
that whereas RelB is a key initiator
of this silencing cascade, G9a is a
central mediator in chromatin compaction. This interpretation is based
on results showing that RelB binds
the promoter in the absence of G9a
(G9a knockdown), which occurs at a
time that transcription silencing is
abrogated. Under these conditions we
also show that HP1 does not bind,
supporting that facultative heterochromatin chromatin reverses to
euchromatin.Incontrast,RelBknockdown results in removal of both G9a
and HP1 from the promoter as well as
reversal of both dimethylation of
H3K9 and transcription silencing.
Transfection of RelB in LPS-responsive cells that do not express RelB
induces accumulation of RelB, G9a,
and HP1 at the IL-1␤ promoter and
silences transcription. Our in vivo
studies further support that the
RelB RHD is required for G9a-mediated gene silencing. Additional in
vitro experiments show that the
N-terminal domain of G9a participates in this interaction by directly
interacting with RelB.
Although published data indicate
that transcription factors and their
interplay with cognate DNA are
linked to gene silencing by both
histone and DNA methylation
responses, there are limited data
about how these molecular bridges
form. However, precedent for G9a
or histones and DNA interactions
with transcription factors or co-factors exist. The growth factor-independent 1 (Gfi1) transcriptional
regulatory oncoprotein couples to
G9a to silence p21 gene transcription (27). CCAAT displacement
protein cut homolog also recruits
G9a to repress transcription of p21
(28). In the innate immune response

RelB Interacts with G9a to Silence Transcription

FIGURE 5. RelB and G9a co-immunoprecipitate in silenced cells and in
vitro. A, silenced cells were transfected with empty vector or HA-RelBwt construct as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Whole cell extracts
were prepared and incubated with anti-G9a, anti-HA RelB, or control IgG antibodies. Immunocomplexes were isolated, and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Primary (1o) antibodies were used
for isolation and purification of immune complexes; secondary (2o) antibodies were used for visualization of immunocomplex by immunoblot and show
that HA-RelBwt forms a protein complex with G9a. These results are representative of three independent experiments. B, GST-G9a bacterially
expressed fusion proteins were tested for direct protein-protein interaction
with in vitro expressed RelB as described under “Experimental Procedures.”
GST-G9a (N-terminal) fusion protein forms a stable complex with RelB,
whereas GST-G9a (C-terminal) fusion protein does not show interaction with
RelB above background (GST vector). Resin alone and RelB input to the GST
pulldown assay (TNT/RelB) are also shown. These results are representative of
three independent experiments.

of cells to viral infection that is recognized by TLR, PRDI-BF1
DNA-binding protein initiates post-induction silencing of
interferon-␤ by direct interaction with G9a, which thereafter
mediates chromatin modifications (29). This scenario is somewhat analogous to what we report herein for RelB induction in
response to TLR4 stimulation. Methylation and deamination of
CpGs generate p53 binding sites on a genomic scale and
thereby may control silencing through altering accessibility of
transcription factors (30). Msx1 transcription factor and the
negative regulator of muscle differentiation core enhancer
region interact with linker histone protein H1 to inhibit transcription and myogenesis (31).
Our data support that binding of RelB and G9a on the promoter depends on the RHD of Rel B and the N-terminal 500

amino acids of G9a. This is not surprising for RelB, as the RHD
domain is required for its binding to partners such as NF-␬B
p100, which are required to stabilize structurally labile RelB (25,
32). The N-terminal region of G9a also provides a structural site
for protein-to-protein interactions, perhaps through its polyglutamic acid domain or cytosine-rich domain (33, 34). However, the precise N-terminal site(s) required for binding transcription factors has not been identified. The G9a ankyrin
repeats that bind to methylation sites on histones and the SET
domains that are enzymatically active are both located in the C
terminus. Also, the precise region(s) of RelB that interacts after
RelB binds to the promoter by the RHD domain are not known.
G9a is a crucial multifunctional mediator of epigenetic
silencing. A recent report links the G9a chromatin compaction
process both to histone H3K9 dimethylation and to methylation of lysine 27 on linker histone H1 isoform 4 (H1.4) (35).
Both methylation sites recruit HP1, which facilitates facultative
heterochromatin formation, and the process supports locating
and retaining H1.4 at gene promoters. Another novel observation in this study is that the coordinated accumulation of H1
and HP1 can be reversed by the H1.4 lysine 27 demethylase
JMJD2/KDMA, an event that could contribute to a return to the
state of euchromatin and competent transcription.
This paradigm of facultative heterochromatin formation
dependent on both histone H3K9 and linker histone H1 methylation modifications controlled by G9a and requiring HP1 may
be important in the SSI and endotoxin-tolerant THP-1 cell.
Recently, we reported that removal of H1 isoforms (including
H1.4 that is referred to as H1b in humans) and HMGB1 by
siRNA removes RelB from the promoters of acute proinflammatory genes IL-1␤ and TNF␣, ablates H3K9 dimethylation,
removes HP1, and reverses transcription silencing in endotoxin-tolerant THP cells (9). This paradigm also appears relevant
to humans with SSI, as in the same study we note that linker
histone H1 and HMGB1 accumulate in vivo at the TNF␣ and
IL-1␤ promoters, but not the IkB␣ promoter, in peripheral
blood leukocytes (9). We also find that RelB is constitutively
expressed, and G9a and HP1 bind to the TNF␣ promoter of
peripheral blood SSI human leukocytes (8, 19).
We advocate that RelB induction generates a pivotal feedback and feed-forward transcription regulator for both activation and repression of distinct sets of genes in a cell- and context-specific manner during inflammatory processes, such as
SSI. An important question is how the NF-␬B pathway might
control both activation of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotypes. It is known that a first wave of p65 may
induce immediate response genes including TNF␣ and
IL-1␤ but also inducing transcription factors that control
downstream reprogramming for expression of both activators and repressors, whose dominance changes over time.
This coupling process may include a second wave of p65
activation by an alternative signaling pathway such as I␬B
kinase ␣ and require protein synthesis. Our unpublished
preliminary data support this possibility.
ThereisaanotherimplicationoftheimportanceoftheNF-␬Bdependent master control system. Because there are many
NF-␬B cognate DNA sites across the genome, our findings predict an extensive inventory for the RelB potential influence on

coordinated events that participate in chromatin compaction and are supported, at least in part by G9a and HP1,
include CpG methylation and recruitment of linker histone
H1 and HMGB1 at proximal promoters. The resulting state
of silenced facultative heterochromatin may be sustained for
days but can return to euchromatin under certain experimental conditions and in SSI survivors. Exploiting this epigenetic plasticity may provide opportunities for specific
therapies for inflammatory diseases.

FIGURE 6. Model for TLR-4-induced RelB-dependent formation of facultative heterochromatin and transcription silencing of acute proinflammatory genes in the SSI phenotype. This conceptual model is based on this
study and components of our previously published work. SSI is initiated when
euchromatin is activated by membrane sensors such as TLR4 that couple to
NF-␬B activation and subsequent binding of p65 and p50 heterodimers to the
promoters of a set of acute proinflammatory genes. Subsequent induction of
RelB leads to its recruitment and direct binding to G9a. G9a dimethylates
H3K9 to which HP1 binds and links to Dnmt3 binding and DNA CpG methylation. Linker histone H1 and HMGB1 (not shown) are recruited and may facilitate remodeling of the nucleosome(s) that “locks” compacted chromatin and
stabilizes the p50/RelB/G9a bond.

the genetic code that regulates inflammation. This RelB-dependent reprogramming may differ among more localized
inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (3), an important concept to investigate.
Also, the nature of the intracellular specificity that distinguishes between transcription repression and activation by
RelB is unknown, but differences in nucleosome topography
among the chromosomes and/or germ line-encoded DNA
proximal promoter sequences in relation to CpG sites for methylation may contribute.
Based on the results of our previous reports and the findings described herein, we provide in Fig. 6 a model for epigenetic regulation of a set of acute proinflammatory genes
during SSI. SSI is often initiated by TLR4-dependent processes that require NF-␬B activation and binding of p65 with
cooperating transactivators and co-factors to multiple gene
promoters, including those of rapid-response acute proinflammatory mediators as well as downstream factors. Epigenomic reprogramming follows the early events. A critical
component of the temporal sequence of gene expression and
the epigenetic reprogramming of SSI is expression of the
NF-␬B factor RelB, which functions as a key initiator of the
silencing cascade by its direct interaction with G9a. G9a acts
as a key mediator in gene silencing through dimethylation of
H3K9, which provides a site for recruitment of HP1. Other
