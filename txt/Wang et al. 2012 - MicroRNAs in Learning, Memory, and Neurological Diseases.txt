MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of small regulatory noncoding RNAs 22 bp in length that mediate post-transcriptional silencing of gene expression via the recognition of specific sequences in target messenger (m)RNAs. The current body
of literature suggests that miRNAs are fine-tuning regulators of gene expression profiles in a wide range of biological processes, from development to cancer. Many miRNAs are highly expressed in the adult nervous system in a spatially and temporally controlled manner in normal physiology, as well as in certain pathological conditions. These findings emphasize that
gene regulation networks based on miRNA activities may be particularly important to brain function, and that perturbation of these networks may result in abnormal brain function. Indeed, miRNAs have been implicated in various aspects of
dendrite remodeling and synaptic plasticity, as well as in experience-dependent adaptive changes of neural circuits in the
postnatal developmental and adult brain. Recent advances in methods of next-generation sequencing, such as RNA-seq,
offer the means to quantitatively evaluate the functions of miRNAs in a genome-wide manner in large cohorts of
samples. These new technologies have already yielded valuable information and are expanding our understanding of
miRNA-based mechanisms in higher-order brain processing, including learning and memory and cognition, as well as in
neuropsychiatric disorders.

Long-term memory (LTM) is established via the stable modification of neural circuits, which includes alterations in the patterning and strength of synaptic connections and the integration and
maintenance of new synapses in existing circuits. These enduring
modifications require the synthesis of proteins (Martin et al.
2000; Kandel 2001; Lynch 2004). Remarkable progress has been
made in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms
that underlie this process in the past decade; several cell-signaling
cascades and proteins have emerged as key regulators of learning
and memory, such as cAMP/PKA, ERK/MAPK, mTOR signaling
pathway, NMDA/AMPA receptor signaling, CaMKII, and cAMPresponse element binding protein (CREB) (Lynch 2004). In a
sense, the most critical signaling pathway for the regulation of
long-lasting memory formation is that containing CREB and its
downstream targets (Silva et al. 1998; Barco et al. 2003). For this
reason, CREB is often referred to as “the master of memory
genes.” Although the majority of protein synthesis occurs at the
cell body in neurons, local protein translation can occur at the
synapse. A subset of mRNAs, presumably in a dormant state,
can be transported to synapses by RNA-binding protein complexes and subjected to “on-demand” translation in response to synaptic activity, contributing to alterations in synaptic number and
strength (Sutton and Schuman 2006). This is intriguing because
this spatially restricted form of translation enables proteins to
be synthesized and possibly retained specifically at synapses, depending upon the form of stimulation.

During development, miRNAs have been shown to function
as master regulators that fine-tune the expression of proteins involved in the proliferation, differentiation, cell cycling, and apoptosis of stem cells. For this role, the expression of miRNAs must
be precisely orchestrated, and dysregulated miRNA profiles are often associated with diseases such as cancer (Esteller 2011). The
study of miRNA in the brain has also centered upon neural development, and it is now clear that miRNAs play a pivotal role in nervous
system developmental phenomena such as neural patterning,
the establishment and maintenance of cell identity, as well as adult
neurogenesis (Coolen and Bally-Cuif 2009; Schratt 2009; Sayed
and Abdellatif 2011). More recently, miRNA function in the adult
nervous system has been revealed to be involved in neuronal
plasticity, including the regulation of synaptic protein synthesis,
dendritic spine morphogenesis, and plasticity-related diseases.
Evidence for miRNA involvement in physiological higher-order
brain functions such as learning, memory, emotions, and mental
illness is also emerging (Forero et al. 2010; Bredy et al. 2011; Salta
and De Strooper 2012).
Two parallel approaches have been undertaken to investigate
miRNA function in the nervous system. One involves the disruption of miRNA biogenesis pathways, which affects the expression
of all miRNAs, and the second utilizes the silencing of single
miRNAs in specific brain regions or cell-types. It is worth noting
that proteins involved in miRNAs biogenesis have pleiotropic
functions, making it difficult to interpret the results of genetic approaches. Also, dependent on the material or model used, there
may be different results. Nevertheless, both approaches have
yielded valuable information toward our understanding of
miRNA function in physiological and pathological conditions.
In addition, the advent of widely available deep-sequencing

Figure 1. Biogenesis of miRNAs. In the nucleus, precursor pri-miRNA is typically transcribed by PolII into long hairpin structures. Pri-miRNA is subsequently cleaved by the microprocessor complex, which includes DCGR8 and Drosha, into pre-miRNA. Pre-miRNA is then exported out of the nucleus by
Exp5 and Ran-GTP. Pre-miRNA can then be further cleaved into a RNA duplex by Dicer/TARBP, whereby they mediate down-regulation of protein expression via RISC. There is evidence that pre-mRNA can also be transported to synapses, where they can mediate local down-regulation of protein expression.
There are examples that there are regulatory feedback loops in which genes regulated by miRNA can act on pathways that lead to activation of epigenetic
factors, e.g., CREB and MeCP2, which regulate miRNA transcription in the nucleus. These epigenetic regulation pathways can also be stimulated by synaptic activity.

technology, such as RNA-Seq, makes it feasible to sequence the
transcriptome of patient cohorts in order to identify important
roles for miRNA in neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and autism (Jacquier 2009; Wang et al. 2009).
The translational control of protein synthesis plays a crucial
role in regulating the individual behaviors of the thousands of
synapses located on the dendritic tree. The ability of miRNAs to
fine-tune protein expression seems well suited for the regulation
of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (Kandel 2009). In
the following sections, we discuss the known functions of
miRNAs in regulating learning and memory, and speculate about
questions which future research might address.

mechanisms and that Pol II-associated transcription factors may
also be involved in transcriptional control of miRNA expression.

Nuclear processing
Following transcription, the pri-miRNA is then cleaved by the microprocessor complex, a large protein complex that includes the
nuclear RNase III Drosha and its cofactor DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 (DGCR8). The product of this process is a 70
nucleotide (nt) precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). The pre-miRNA
forms a “mini helix motif” secondary structure that consists of a
short stem loop and a 2– 3-nt overhang. The pre-miRNA can be
recognized and transported out of the nucleus by interacting
with Exportin 5 and Ran-GTP (Bartel 2004; Kim et al. 2009).

miRNA biogenesis

Following transport into the cytoplasm, pre-miRNA is further processed by the cytoplasmic RNase III enzyme, Dicer, into a mature
21– 25-nt miRNA duplex. Dicer is a highly conserved protein that
is widely expressed in most tissues and cell types, and is usually associated with a double-stranded RNA-binding protein (dsRBD)containing partner such as the TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP)
in humans (Chendrimada et al. 2005). One strand of the
pre-miRNA, the passenger strand, is degraded, while the other,
the guide strand, is assembled into the Argonaut protein complex
to generate the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RISC
then guides the binding of the mature miRNA to the 3′

A schematic of miRNA biogenesis is shown in Figure 1. The majority of microRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II),
with a few exceptions being transcribed by RNA polymerase III. The
product of miRNA gene transcription is the primary miRNA
(pri-miRNA). Promoter analysis of miRNA genes reveals that a significant number of miRNA promoter sequences contain Pol II elements such as TATA boxes (Kim and Nam 2006), suggesting that
miRNA and protein-coding mRNA transcription share similar

MicroRNAs in learning and memory

untranslated region (3′ UTR) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs)
based on complementarity, resulting in either translational repression or mRNA degradation via the RISC machinery. The recognition of target mRNA by the RISC/miRNA complex generally
relies on a seed region spanning nucleotides 2– 8 at the 5′ end of
the miRNA, although atypical and marginal sites have also been
described (Bartel 2009). This limited sequence complementarity
between a miRNA and its target mRNAs allows a single miRNA
to regulate the expression of many different mRNAs (Brodersen
and Voinnet 2009). For a more detailed discussion of miRNA biosynthesis, target verification, and action mechanism, there are a
number of excellent reviews (Bartel 2004, 2009; Kim et al. 2009;
Krol et al. 2010b).

expressed throughout tissues analyzed, whereas mature miR-318
is spatially restricted to distinct cell types and central nervous system regions (Obernosterer et al. 2006).
Another intriguing observation is that miRNA precursors are
also detected in synaptic fractions at levels comparable to whole
tissue, whereas mature miRNAs are predominantly associated
with soluble components of the synaptic fractions, implying a local processing of miRNA precursors (Lugli et al. 2008). Related to
this, proteins important for miRNA processing and function, including Dicer, eIF2C (Lugli et al. 2005), Fragile X Mental
Retardation protein (FMRP) (Feng et al. 1997; Dictenberg et al.
2008), Armitage of the RISC complex in Drosophila, and its mammalian homolog MOV10, are all presented at dendrites (Ashraf
et al. 2006; Banerjee et al. 2009). However, so far it remains unclear how they are transported ultimately to dendrites and how
their activities are regulated.

microRNA expression in the adult nervous system
The human nervous system is anatomically and functionally sophisticated, exemplified by the extraordinary diversity of neural
cell types that are connected in precise circuitries to orchestrate
specific behavioral repertoires. Additional complexity comes
from the intricate morphological specializations of axons, dendrites, and synapses in individual neurons. This complexity is likely generated by temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression
profiles throughout the development of the nervous system. In
the adult brain, gene expression is under constant control, not
only in each specific brain region and cell type, but also in conditions such as in rest or active states, or upon external stimulation.
In conjunction with histone modification and DNA methylation,
miRNAs control gene expression in an epigenetic manner, in
which protein expression is regulated post-transcriptionally. The
majority of miRNAs display tissue-specific expression (Bartel
2004; Landgraf et al. 2007), with over half of currently identified
miRNA expressed or enriched in the brain (Kosik and Krichevsky
2005). A subset of brain miRNAs also exhibits temporally regulated
expression patterns (Kim et al. 2004; Sempere et al. 2004; Landgraf
et al. 2007).
miRNAs may play an important role in mnemonic neural circuitry by functioning in various brain regions and cell types. A survey of miRNA expression profiles in the adult brain revealed that a
number of miRNAs are expressed specifically in the hippocampus
and cortex, suggesting that they might be particularly engaged in
the regulatory network involved in synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Bak et al. 2008). Efforts to identify miRNAs that localize to subcellular compartments in the neuron have also
yielded interesting results. Using laser capture dissection and multiplex RT–PCR, Kye et al. (2007) reported that miR-26a is highly
enriched in dendrites compared to the soma (Kye et al. 2007).
Further investigation into miRNAs enriched in synaptic fractions
revealed that, while the majority of miRNAs known to be expressed in the brain are detectable in synaptic fractions, a subset
of miRNAs is significantly enriched in synaptic fractions compared
to total forebrain expression levels. Some examples of synaptically
enriched miRNAs include miR-200c, miR-339, and miR-322, as
well as miR-318, miR-29a, miR-7, and miR-137 (Lugli et al. 2008;
Siegel et al. 2009). A number of miRNAs enriched in distal axons
of sympatheic neurons were also identified, including miR-15bm
miR-16, miR204, and miR-221 (Natera-Naranjo et al. 2010).
Furthermore, a recent study systematically analyzed miRNA expression profiles in several neuronal cell-types using a combination of miRNA tagging and affinity-purification (miRAP) with
cell type-specific genetic manipulations. The investigators revealed that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, and even subtypes of GABAergic neurons, have distinct miRNAs expression
profiles, highlighting that miRNA expression is differentially regulated in distinct types of neurons (He et al. 2012). This concept is
supported by an observation that pre-miR-138-2 is ubiquitously

Activity-dependent regulation of miRNA
expression in the adult brain
While miRNAs control the translation of their target mRNAs, they
themselves are under tight regulation, most likely via the same
mechanisms that control mRNA transcription, splicing, and editing. Activity-dependent regulation of gene expression is crucial
for synaptic plasticity and memory formation, and this is true for
many miRNAs as well. A recent study showed that miR-132 expression is rapidly increased following potassium chloride (KCl)- and
bicuculline-mediated neuronal activation (Wayman et al. 2008).
This increase was attenuated by inhibition of the CREB signaling
pathway, suggesting that neuronal activity-dependent regulation
of miR-132 expression occurs via CREB-dependent mechanisms.
miR-212, which resides in the same gene locus as miR-132, is likely
also to be under the control of CREB (Wayman et al. 2008;
Nudelman et al. 2010). Thus, similar to many learning and memory genes, miRNAs can be regulated in a neuronal activitydependent manner (Silva et al. 1998). Furthermore, a recent study
demonstrated that miR-125a levels were reduced in synaptoneurosomes upon (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG; an mGluR1/
5 agonist) treatment, suggesting that activity may affect the turnover ratio of miRNAs (Muddashetty et al. 2011). Krol et al.
(2010a) demonstrated that miRNAs in neurons decay much faster
than in non-neuronal cells, and there was activity-dependent
changes in the turnover rate. These studies indicate that neuronal
activity is one mechanism for higher metabolism of miRNAs in
neurons.
A unique feature of miRNA transcription is that miRNAs
clustered together in the genome may be transcribed together
as a single pri-miRNA, which is then processed into individual
mature miRNAs. This makes the examination of miRNA expression relatively complicated. A survey of the potential mechanisms responsible for the regulation of the miR-3792410
cluster demonstrated that this entire cluster is regulated at the
transcriptional level by neuronal activity in a Mef2-dependent
manner, and that at least three members of this cluster,
miR-134, miR-329, and miR-381, are necessary for the activityinduced elaboration of dendritic spines (Fiore et al. 2009). It is
important to note that although these results suggest that all
members of this cluster are affected by KCl and BDNF treatment,
individual miRNAs may have different activities depending on
the availably of their targets or the half-life of individual
miRNA, and therefore not all miRNAs in the cluster are necessarily involved in dendrite outgrowth, such as miR-495 and
miR-541; these miRNAs may instead be involved in other aspects
of activity-dependent remodeling of synaptic plasticity. Another
example of post-transcriptional regulation of miRNA expression
comes from the study of miR-376 cluster; certain isoforms of

MicroRNAs in learning and memory

Somatic transcriptional control of synapse formation
and maturation in the adult brain

miR-376 undergo adenosine-to-inosine editing, which occurs
only in specific brain regions (Kawahara et al. 2007). One speculation is that these post-transcriptional modifications may be regulated in an activity-dependent manner as well.

The formation of new memories requires not just local protein
translation, but also depends upon the de novo transcription of
specific mRNAs. Studies done on the sea slug Aplysia and mice suggested that CREB-dependent gene expression is an important and
conserved mechanism in the consolidation of LTM. Activation of
CREB by extracellular stimuli, such as behavioral experiences,
leads to the expression of proteins that stabilize the structural
and functional changes in synapses necessary for encoding specific memory traces. As such, CREB has been considered as the most
critical transcription factor in memory formation (Silva et al.
1998; Lynch 2004; Kandel 2009).
Given the importance of CREB for memory formation, it is of
particular interest to know that CREB expression is also under the
control of miRNAs. miRNA-134 was shown to localize to both the
soma and dendrites of primary cultured neurons and to regulate
dendritic spine development by targeting LimK1 mRNA, which
can be suppressed by BDNF (Schratt et al. 2006). A recent study
showed that miR-134 is involved in modulating LTM via the regulation of CREB mRNA, which subsequently affects BDNF expression. In addition, the investigators also demonstrated that
miR-134 expression was up-regulated in mice expressing an inactive form of Sirtuin 1, suggesting the tightly controlled miRNA expression might be epigenetically regulated (Gao et al. 2010). In
summary, miR-134 mediates decreased CREB-mediated BDNF expression by targeting CREB mRNA and therefore impacts learning
and memory by “regulating the regulator”.
miR-124 is extensively involved in the silencing of nonneuronal genes during brain development, and is therefore seen
as an important factor for preserving neuronal identity. In a study
by the Kandel group, the investigators expanded the known functions of miR-124 to include the regulation of learning and memory
in the adult brain. Using massive parallel sequencing, investigators
identified 170 distinct miRNAs in Aplysia, nine of which are enriched in the brain. Furthermore, they found that miR-124 is exclusively enriched in sensory neurons of Aplysia, both in the cell body
and processes. Functionally, miR-124 constrains serotonin-induced synaptic plasticity via regulation of CREB (Rajasethupathy
et al. 2009). Stimulation of neuronal activity by serotonin, which
has been shown to be critical for the formation of memory in
Aplysia, leads to a robust decrease in mature miR-124, but not
pre-miR-124 expression, and this reduction is mediated by MAPK
signaling. Importantly, the investigators demonstrated that the increased level of miR-124 impairs, whereas reducing the level of
miR-124 enhances serotonin-induced long-term facilitation
(LTF). This effect was mediated by the transcriptional regulation
of CREB and CREB-mediated signaling pathways, which results
in an enhancement in serotonin-induced synaptic plasticity.
This study elegantly provides a functional link between miR-124
activity and expression of its target gene, CREB (Rajasethupathy
et al. 2009).
In addition to being a miRNA target, CREB also regulates
miRNA transcription, as discussed previously. In another example
of miRNA playing a role in negative feedback regulation, it was
shown that miR-132 and MeCP2 act on each other for homeostatic control. MeCP2 is a target of miR-132, whereas decreased
MeCP2 expression reduces miR-132 levels in vivo, presumably resulting in decreased down-regulation of MeCP2 for homeostatic
regulation (Klein et al. 2007). Based on these observations, it is
reasonable to conclude that the learning and memory deficiency
in adult MeCP2 knockout mice is at least partially mediated by
loss of MeCP2-regulated miRNA expression (McGraw et al.
2011). miRNA regulation of MeCP2 will be discussed in further detail later (Edbauer et al. 2010; Impey et al. 2010).

MicroRNA regulation of synaptic plasticity,
learning, and memory
Regulation of local protein synthesis at the synapse
It is generally accepted that long-term memory (LTM) formation
is dependent on new protein expression, and that local protein
synthesis in the neuronal dendrite is critical for the synaptic
changes induced by neuronal activity (Sutton and Schuman
2006). This process must be precisely controlled, as neurons
need to selectively modify interconnections in response to different types and strengths of inputs. Therefore, an understanding of
the regulation of local protein synthesis is crucial to the study of
learning and memory and synaptic plasticity, both under physiological conditions and in disease states.
A series of studies demonstrated that proteins associated with
the miRNA biogenesis pathway, such as Dicer, Argonaute, and the
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), are all expressed
within the RNA granules of dendrites distal to the nucleus (Jin
et al. 2004; Dictenberg et al. 2008). In Drosophila, the RISC complex protein, Armitage, was shown to be present at the synapse
and to function as a negative regulator of long-lasting memory.
The presence of Armitage in this system is inversely correlated
to synaptic protein synthesis and is likely involved in a
miRNA-mediated down-regulation of calcium/calmodulindependent kinase II (CaMKII) (Ashraf et al. 2006). Similarly, two
other components of the RISC complex, elF2c and Dicer, are
also present in dendritic spines and at the postsynaptic density
(PSD). Treatment of cells with either NMDA or Ca2+ releases
Dicer and elF2c from the PSD (Lugli et al. 2005). Although the specific miRNAs involved in these studies remain to be determined,
these works collectively support the hypothesis that miRNAs are
involved in dendritic protein translation essential for memory
storage and other cognitive tasks.
Specific miRNAs that are involved in the regulation of dendritic arborization and synaptogenesis in the adult brain are just
beginning to be identified. The FMRP protein is associated with
miR-125b and miR-132 in the brain, and these miRNAs have opposing effects on dendritic spine morphology. While miR-125b
negatively regulates synaptic plasticity via targeting NR2A
mRNA, miR-132 overexpression increases dendritic protrusion
width and mEPSC amplitude (Edbauer et al. 2010). This is consistent with the positive effect of miR-132 on dendrite branching
through repression of p250GAP (Wayman et al. 2008). A functional
screen in primary cultured neurons identified miRNAs enriched
or depleted in synaptosomes (Siegel et al. 2009). Particularly interesting was miR-138, which is a negative regulator of dendritic
spine size due to, at least in part, APT1 down-regulation. APT1 is
a depalmitoylation enzyme, indicating that miR-138 may be regulating the membrane localization of a whole class of proteins.
The same group reported that dendritic miR-134 increases drastically upon stimulation and consequently promotes dendritogenesis by inhibiting the translational repressor Pumilio2 (Fiore et al.
2009). Moreover, miR-485 colocalizes with one of its targets,
synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, in dendrites and was shown to regulate dendritic spine number and synapse formation in an activitydependent homeostatic manner (Cohen et al. 2011). In Drosophila,
miRNA down-regulation pathways and several miRNAs, such as
bantam and miR-12, are suggested to be involved in regulating
synapse-specific plasticity during long-term olfactory habituation
(McCann et al. 2011).

MicroRNAs in learning and memory

Direct evidence of miRNA regulation
in learning and memory

behaviors may result from long-lasting structural and functional
modifications of synapses that ultimately lead to an increased
adaptive response toward the reward effects of cocaine, which
eventually leads to uncontrolled drug intake (Luscher and
Bellone 2008; Luscher and Malenka 2011). Given the important
roles that miRNAs have in synaptic plasticity, it is not surprising
that multiple studies have demonstrated the involvement of
miRNAs in cocaine addiction. Extended exposure to cocaine leads
to marked miR-212 up-regulation in the dorsal striatum of rats, a
region involved in the development of compulsive cocaine use,
and this miR-212 increase is concomitant with the increase of total and phosphorylated CREB (Hollander et al. 2010). These investigators found that the overexpression of miR-212 significantly
amplifies CREB-mediated signaling, at least partially through
the activation of Raf1, a CREB kinase, and increases expression
of the CREB coactivator, TORC (Hollander et al. 2010). In a following study by the same group, it was shown that MeCP2 and
miR-212 regulate each other’s expression in a negative feedback
loop, and shows that this homeostatic regulation regulates
cocaine-mediated BDNF expression in the dorsal striatum, thereby influencing cocaine intake (Im et al. 2010). Given the critical
role for CREB in the regulation of BDNF expression, these data collectively indicate that the interplay between MeCP2, miR-212,
CREB, and BDNF might play a key role in the development of addictive behaviors.
In a miRNA profiling screen of cocaine-induced plasticity
genes, it was shown that the miRNAs let-7d and miR-124 are
down-regulated, whereas miR-181a is up-regulated in a mesolimbic dopaminergic system under chronic cocaine administration
(Chandrasekar and Dreyer 2009; Saba et al. 2012). Additionally,
specific deletion of the miRNA processing protein Ago2 in dopamine receptor D2-expressing neurons in mice resulted in an alleviation of cocaine addiction and the dysregulation of a distinct group
of miRNAs in the striatum (Schaefer et al. 2010), suggesting that
these miRNAs may contribute to various facets of addictive behavior. Finally, next-generation miRNA sequencing, microRNA-Seq,
was used to identify cocaine-regulated miRNAs in the nucleus
accumbens and striatal synapses. A number of miRNAs were identified that exhibit cocaine-induced expression changes, such as the
miR-8 family members miR-429 and miR-200a/b (Eipper-Mains
et al. 2011).
miRNAs are also involved in modulating brain physiology
underlying alcohol addiction. In the adult mammalian brain, alcohol exposure rapidly up-regulates miR-9 expression levels in the
striatum and supraoptic nucleus (SON). This up-regulated miR-9
then affects the expression of alternatively spliced voltage-activated potassium channel (BK) mRNA variants by binding to specific
BK 3′ UTR sequences (Pietrzykowski et al. 2008). These data suggest a potential role for microRNAs in the regulation of alternatively spliced mRNA in drug addiction and abuse. Additionally,
miRNAs-mediated mechanisms were also involved in opioid addiction, such as miR-23b, let-7, and miR-190 (Wu et al. 2008; He
et al. 2010; Zheng et al. 2010). Overall, these studies support a
role for miRNAs in already highly sophisticated molecular mechanisms of addiction, and advocate further research in this field. A
summary of miRNAs discussed in this section is found in
Supplemental Table 1.

As previously discussed, multiple studies have provided evidence
that miRNA pathways are involved in the regulation of synaptic
plasticity by controlling protein synthesis in response to external
stimulation. Davis et al. (2008) reported that the specific deletion
of Dicer in CaMKII positive neurons, which knocks out gene expression in excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus during
development, results in an array of phenotypes including microcephaly,reduceddendriticbranch arborization,andtheelongation
of dendritic spines with no concomitant change in spine density
(Davis et al. 2008). However, the consequence of aberrant miRNA
expression in the fully developed brain remains unclear. To investigate this question, Konopka et al. (2010) created a Dicer mutant mouse using a tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2 driven by the
CaMKII promoter, enabling the neuronal deletion of Dicer in the
mature mouse brain (Konopka et al. 2010). Interestingly, these mutant mice displayed increased performance in several behavioral
tests of learning and memory, such as the Morris water maze and
trace fear conditioning, 12 wk following the induction of Dicer
deletion. The induction of LTP, recorded from hippocampal CA1
synapses of mutant animals, was comparable to wild type, while
permeability transition pore (PTP) recordings were enhanced.
Neurons in the mutant animals exhibit elongated filopodia-like
dendritic spines and an increased translation of synaptic plasticity-related proteins such as BDNF and MMP-9 (Konopka et al.
2010). The data presented in this study suggest that miRNA regulates the translation of genes important for synaptic plasticity, possibly by increasing the threshold of activity-dependent gene
expression or by decreasing the efficiencyof local protein synthesis.
In line with these studies, it was demonstrated that in Drosophila
long last memory formation is controlled by the miRNA-mediated
silencing complex RISC. Furthermore, Armitage, a key component
of RISC, is localized to synapses under basal conditions, but degraded upon neural activity or the induction of LTM, implying
that synaptic protein synthesis essential for establishment of stable
memory is regulated by RISC activity (Ashraf et al. 2006).
As mentioned above, the NAD-dependent deacetylase, Sirt1,
is necessary for normal associative learning in the contextual fear
memory task, and this function requires crosstalk with miR-134,
which directly influences CREB-dependent signaling (Gao et al.
2010; Michan et al. 2010). Transgenic overexpression of miR-132
in mice leads to increased spine density, but also impairs the ability
of mice to perform in novel object recognition. In addition, transgenic miR-132 mice exhibited a decrease in the expression of
MeCP2, a confirmed miR-132 target (Hansen et al. 2010). Taken together, these studies support the concept of an integrated network
in learning and memory that involves miRNA activity and epigenetic modifiers such as MeCP2 and Sirt1 to fine-tune gene expression patterns (Levenson and Sweatt 2005).
A recent study implicated miR-128b in fear-extinction memory formation (Lin et al. 2011). Investigators demonstrated that
although miR-134 and miR-128b were both up-regulated after
fear conditioning, only miR-128b was significantly affected by extinction training. Knockdown of miR-128b impaired the formation of fear-extinction memory, indicating that miR-128b is
specific to the extinction learning-induced memory. As discussed
previously, miR-124 is involved in the sensory-motor memory
paradigm of Aplysia (Rajasethupathy et al. 2009). Taken together,
it is evident that miRNAs are involved in various types of memory,
and their mechanism might be evolutionally conserved.

MicroRNAs in learning and memory

in humans, and gradually accelerates as a person ages, particularly
in age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) (Yankner et al.
2008; Salthouse 2009). In Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases,
cognitive symptoms such as executive dysfunction and learning,
memory, and attention deficits are prominent, and are often more
disabling than are the hallmark motor symptoms (Rubinsztein
and Carmichael 2003; Samii et al. 2004).
The activity of miRNAs, as well as dysregulated miRNA
processing, have been directly implicated in the pathogenesis of
complex neurodegenerative diseases. In several recent mouse
studies, the Dicer enzyme was inactivated either in specific brain
regions or during particular time windows, and the results clearly
emphasize the importance of miRNAs for neuronal survival in
these neurodegenerative diseases (Bilen et al. 2006; Kim et al.
2007; Schaefer et al. 2007; Davis et al. 2008; Hebert et al. 2010).
For example, the conditional knockout of Dicer in midbrain dopaminergic neurons using dopamine transporter (DAT) Cre results
in progressive dopaminergic neuron loss. It was further shown
that miR-133b is depleted in patients with Parkinson’s disease,
as well as in Dicer mutant mice. Functional experiments have
shown that miR-133b regulates the maturation and function of
dopaminergic neurons through a negative feedback loop by
suppressing the expression of Pitx3, a transcription factor important for long-term survival and maintenance of the dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, which in turn regulates
miR-133b transcription (Kim et al. 2007). Interestingly, the depletion of Dicer in dopamine receptor-1 (DR-1) expressing striatal
neurons, which receive inputs from DAT neurons, results in no
significant increase in cell death, although the mice display a
range of phenotypes including ataxia and front and hind limb
clasping. However, no specific miRNAs was investigated in this
study (Cuellar et al. 2008). The comparison of miRNA expression
profiles between DAT and DR-1 positive cells could likely identify
miRNAs not essential for DR-1 neuron survival, but required for
their proper function. In another seminal study, Gehrke et al.
(2020) elegantly demonstrated that LRRK2, mutations of which
cause familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease, interact with
miRNA pathways to regulate protein synthesis; specifically, let-7
and miR-184∗ have been identified in mediating the pathogenic
LRRK2 effect (Gehrke et al. 2010). Studies profiling miRNAs in
the brain tissue from Parkinson’s disease patients have identified
a decrease of miR-34b/c both at late (clinical) and early stages
(pre-motor stage) of the disease, suggesting that miR-34b/c dysregulation may be one of the pathogenic triggers that ultimately
compromises cell viability (Minones-Moyano et al. 2011). In
contrast to these human studies, a recent study demonstrated
significantly unregulated miR-34c in the hippocampus of aged
and AD mice models, concomitant with impaired memory function (Zovoilis et al. 2011). In addition, genetic polymorphisms
located at the 3′ UTR of the Parkinson’s risk factor gene, fibroblast growth factor 20 (FGF20), disrupt the complementary binding of miR-433 with FGF20 mRNA, which presumably inhibits
miR-433-mediated down-regulation of FGF20 expression (Wang
et al. 2008a).
The regulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by
miRNAs has been suggested by several different studies. For example, miR-101 was shown to regulate APP expression in cultured
neurons by targeting a site on the 3′ UTR of APP, and inhibition
of endogenous miR-101 increases APP levels in vivo (Vilardo
et al. 2010). Smith et al. (2011) observed a down-regulation of
miR-124 in human Alzheimer’s disease brains, which may suggest
aberrant splicing of APP by an indirect mechanism (Smith et al.
2011). Furthermore, the translational control of b-secretase 1
(BACE1), an enzyme involved in the production of b-amyloid
from APP, by miRNAs has also been well-documented; these
www.learnmem.org

miRNAs include miR-107, miR-298, miR-328, miR-29a/b-1, and
miR-9 (Hebert et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008b; Boissonneault
et al. 2009). In addition, variation in the miR-659 binding site
in the 3′ UTR of the progranulin gene was suggested to be a risk
factor for TDP43-positive FTD (Rademakers et al. 2008). Finally,
at least 15 miRNAs have been found to be dysregulated in
prion-induced neurodegeneration (Saba et al. 2008).
The dysregulation of miRNA has also been strongly implicated in hereditary polyglutamine diseases. The huntingtin (Htt)
protein directly interacts with the miRNA processing protein
Ago2, and both are presented in “p bodies,” cytoplasmic foci
that contain translationally repressed mRNAs with bound proteins; furthermore, the depletion of Htt compromises miRNAmediated gene silencing (Savas et al. 2008). The reduced expression of Dicer dramatically enhances polyQ toxicity in
Drosophila and human cells induced by overexpression of pathogenic SCA3 and t protein (Bilen et al. 2006). A number of specific
miRNAs were also identified in both murine models of
Huntington’s disease and in the brain tissue of Huntington’s disease patients, such asmiR-34b, miR-9/9∗ , and miR-29b (Hebert
et al. 2008; Packer et al. 2008; Gaughwin et al. 2011). These
miRNAs have also been shown to regulate BACE1 translation, suggesting the existence of a shared microRNA regulatory cascade that
contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s
diseases.

microRNAs in neuropsychiatric disorders
Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is characterized by cognitive impairments, by positive symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, and by negative symptoms such as decreased
emotional expression and apathy (van Os and Kapur 2009). An
excellent example that suggests an association between miRNA
function and schizophrenia comes from studies of 22q11.2
microdeletions. An estimated one-third of all individuals who
carry this chromosomal defect eventually develop schizophrenialike symptoms (Pulver et al. 1994; Murphy et al. 1999). Stark et al.
(2008) generated a mouse model with a deletion of the corresponding human chromosomal segment, which includes nearly
all the functional genes affected by the human 22q11.2 deletion,
including the miRNA processing protein, DGCR8 (Stark et al.
2008). These mice exhibit abnormal microRNA biogenesis due
to the loss of DGCR8 function, and the subsequent impaired expression of a subset of miRNAs, including miR-134 (Burmistrova
et al. 2007), which is directly implicated in learning and memory
(Gao et al. 2010). The behavioral defects displayed by these mice
are accompanied by abnormal dendrite and spine morphogenesis, which may result from dysregulated miRNA expression.
Our understanding of schizophrenia etiology has been revolutionized over the past several years by improvements in rapid
DNA sequencing and analysis technology that enable genomewide association studies (GWAS) of large patient populations.
In a collaborative effort to identify common single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a risk of schizophrenia,
it was reported that the SNP rs1625579, localized in an intronic
region of a large transcript proposed to encode the pri-miR-137,
is one of the SNPs most significantly associated with risk of
schizophrenia (Ripke et al. 2011). More importantly, four out of
10 genome-wide significant loci significantly associated with
the risk of schizophrenia were also predicted miR-137 target
genes that have recently been validated (Kwon et al. 2011). This
is intriguing, as miR-137 is known to regulate both neuronal
maturation and adult neurogenesis (Smrt et al. 2010; Szulwach
et al. 2010). Further mechanistic analyses will be necessary to

MicroRNAs in learning and memory

ascertain the contribution of the observed variants to the schizophrenia phenotype. The genome locus encoding miR-137 is embedded in a CpG island, and its expression is inversely regulated
by MeCP2 mediated DNA methylation (Balaguer et al. 2010;
Szulwach et al. 2010). In sum, these data collectively highlight
an integral epigenetic regulatory mechanism involving the interplay of miR-137 with chromatin-modifying enzymes that might
contribute to the cognitive and/or behavioral abnormalities of
schizophrenia.
Additionally, altered expression of miRNAs was found in the
postmortem brain tissue of schizophrenia patients (Perkins et al.
2007; Beveridge et al. 2008; Gardiner et al. 2011), several of which
were experimentally verified, such as miR-181b, Let-7g, miR-26b,
miR-30b, miR29b, and miR-106b. Additionally, genetic or pharmacological disruption of NMDA receptor signaling, which is
strongly implicated in the behavioral disturbances of schizophrenia, leads to the reduced expression of miR-219 in the prefrontal
cortex of mice, concomitant with an up-regulation of its target
gene, CaMKII, suggesting that miR-219 may contribute to
NMDA hypofunction in schizophrenia (Kocerha et al. 2009).
Considering the heterogeneity of schizophrenia and the ability
of each miRNA to affect the expression of hundreds of target
genes, understanding the impact of miRNAs to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia necessitates deeper and larger-scale studies
in the future.

of miR-132 leads to increased MeCP2 levels, while the overexpression of miR-132 decreases MeCp2 levels. In vivo, the loss of
MeCP2 in mice reduces miR-132 expression levels (Klein et al.
2007). These studies suggest the presence of a feedback loop involving miRNAs that may be important for the homeostatic regulation of MeCP2 during critical periods of development (Klein
et al. 2007; Hansen et al. 2010). Such a relationship would also
be particularly relevant in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric
disease (Ramocki and Zoghbi 2008). Interestingly, viral-mediated
MeCP2 knockdown in the dorsal striatum of rats results in increases of both miR-132 and miR-212, which is cocaine-dependent,
and which in turn regulates MeCP2 (Hollander et al. 2010; Im
et al. 2010). The discrepancy between these two sets of studies
may be due to the difference of the species studied (mice vs. rat)
or the brain region investigated, as the latter primarily focused
on striatum. Note that in the latter study, MeCP2 regulates
miR-132 expression only under the extended cocaine access condition, indicating that this regulation is likely activity dependent.
Nevertheless, since these two miRNAs are both regulated by CREB
to rapidly induce their transcription (Nudelman et al. 2010) and
their activities are sufficient to modulate dendritic plasticity, it
is plausible to conclude that homeostatic regulation of miRNAs
by MeCP2 and CREB and/or neuronal activity is important for
experience-dependent neuronal plasticity, and disruption of this
regulation may contribute to RTT pathoetiology.
Efforts to identify miRNAs that are regulated by MeCP2 in
vivo has recently advanced rapidly using genome-wide DNA sequencing analysis and microarray, followed by quantitative
(q)PCR (Urdinguio et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2010). In these studies,
both up- and down-regulated miRNAs are observed following alterations in MeCP2, and most of these miRNA genes are bound
by MeCP2 in their pri-miRNA transcript promoter region. For example, miR-137, which has been shown to be up-regulated in
MeCP2-null adult neural stem cells, is also up-regulated in the cerebella of MeCP2-null mice (Wu et al. 2010). miRNAs involved in
neurological disorders are summarized in Supplemental Table 2.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)
Thanks to the advance of the next-generation sequence, GWAS
and CNV studies in the past several years have yielded insights
into our understanding of the etiology of ASD. However, so far little is known about the potential importance of miRNAs in disease
progression. Here we cover two well-known “single gene” ASD,
Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome.
Fragile X syndrome is caused by the loss of FMRP, a RNA-binding protein, and is characterized by severe mental retardation.
FMRP has been shown to interact with the miRNA biosynthesis
proteins Argonaute2 (AGO2), EIF2C2, RISC, and Dicer, which
strongly suggests that FMRP may function in miRNA-mediated
gene regulation. However, no difference has been found between
the miRNA profiles of brain tissue from FMRP knockout mice
and their age-matched littermates, arguing that FMRP may be
more relevant to mechanisms of miRNA transport or target recognition than to biogenesis (Landgraf et al. 2007). In support of this
notion, a recent study found that FMRP associates with a dozen different miRNAs and that two of these, miR-125b and miR-132, oppositely regulate dendritic spine morphology and synaptic
physiology (Edbauer et al. 2010). FMRP knockdown also ameliorates the effect of miR-125b and miR-132 overexpression on dendritic spine morphology. These investigators also identified the
NMDAR NR2A subunit to be a target of miR-125b, and found
that NR2A mRNA is associated with FMRP. These observations support the idea that the function of FMRP is, at least partly, to bring
miRNA and mRNA into the same RISC protein complex, and likely
facilitates target recognition.
Rett syndrome (RTT) is a postnatal neurodevelopmental disorder cause by mutations in the MECP2 gene. Both loss- and
gain-of-function mutations in the MeCP2 protein can profoundly
affect brain development and lead to a spectrum of abnormal
behavioral phenotypes and cognitive deficits (Chahrour and
Zoghbi 2007). Given the critical role of MeCP2 in postnatal brain
development and the overwhelming evidence that miRNAs regulate neuronal differentiation, dendrite spine morphology, and
synaptic plasticity, it is reasonable to assume that these moieties
regulate gene expression in a coordinated manner. We know
that MeCP2 translation is regulated by miR-132—the blockade

Conclusions and outlook
In the past five years, significant progress has been made in our
understanding of miRNAs and their functions in learning, memory, and mental illness. However, this new knowledge likely represents just the tip of the iceberg compared to what we expect to
learn in the next decade. We believe that a great number of
miRNA mechanisms will be elucidated in the next few years given
the combination of new technology and international collaborative efforts. There are several avenues that will significantly contribute to our understanding of miRNA function in normal
physiology and malfunction in diseases such as mental illness
and severe psychiatric disease. The most promising technology
is next-generation sequencing, in particular, whole-genome sequencing and RNA-Seq. The ability to rapidly and inexpensively
sequence the human genome will make it feasible to sequence
the genomes of groups of afflicted individuals, thereby enabling
scientists to discover the genetic causes of complex disorders. In
addition, techniques including RNA-Seq will enable us to quantify the relative expression levels of miRNAs and their target transcripts and to evaluate the effects of dysregulated expression,
thereby clearly defining roles for the large number of miRNAs expressed in the human brain.
