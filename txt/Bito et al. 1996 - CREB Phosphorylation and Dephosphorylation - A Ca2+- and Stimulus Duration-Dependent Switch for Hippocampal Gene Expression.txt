Summary
While changes in gene expression are critical for many
brain functions, including long-term memory, little is
known about the cellular processes that mediate stimulus–transcription coupling at central synapses. In
studying the signaling pathways by which synaptic
inputs control the phosphorylation state of cyclic
AMP–responsive element binding protein (CREB) and
determine expression of CRE-regulated genes, we
found two important Ca21/calmodulin (CaM)–regulated
mechanisms in hippocampal neurons: a CaM kinase
cascade involving nuclear CaMKIV and a calcineurindependent regulation of nuclear protein phosphatase
1 activity. Prolongation of the synaptic input on the
time scale of minutes, in part by an activity-induced
inactivation of calcineurin, greatly extends the period
over which phospho-CREB levels are elevated, thus
affecting induction of downstream genes.
Introduction
In all eukaryotic cells, proper communication between
extracellular signals and the nucleus is necessary to
trigger specific patterns of gene expression (Hunter,
1995). Not only must this signaling transmit information
in space, from the surface membrane to the nucleus,
but it also must perform a conversion in time, to link
external inputs that are often transient to nuclear outputs that are sustained over a much longer period. The
linkage between different patterns of cellular activity
and gene expression takes on special importance for
the understanding of various forms of brain plasticity
such as learning and memory. Bursts of synaptic activity
that may induce prompt changes in synaptic strength
can also control the expression of genes encoding synaptic proteins, ion channels, kinases, and immediate
early genes (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993; Curran and
Morgan, 1995). Some of these have been shown to be
important in memory (Silva et al., 1992; Paylor et al.,
1994; Matsuoka et al., 1995). More generally, the production of new RNAs and proteins is required for stable
behavioral changes in many animal species (Davis and
Squire, 1984; DeZazzo and Tully, 1995; Mayford et al.,
1995). Thus, it is likely that the signaling between synapse and nucleus is critical for the generation and persistence of memory. However, it is not yet clear whether
postmitotic neurons have evolved specific synapse-

to-nucleus signaling pathways or whether they rely entirely on the cellular machinery found in dividing cells
such as fibroblasts.
The cyclic AMP–responsive element binding protein
(CREB) is a transcription factor of general importance
in both neuronal and other cells (Hunter, 1995; Mayford
et al., 1995). CREB phosphorylation on Ser-133 promotes the activation of genes with an upstream CRE
element (Brindle and Montminy, 1992). CREB phosphorylation and downstream gene expression can in principle be regulated by protein kinases under the control
of cAMP (Gonzalez and Montminy, 1989), Ca2 1 (Dash
et al., 1991; Sheng et al., 1991; Bading et al., 1993;
Deisseroth et al., 1996) or both (Impey et al., 1996).
Alteration of CREB function specifically affects longterm synaptic changes and long-term memory while
sparing short-term changes (Dash et al., 1990; Bourtchuladze et al., 1994; Yin et al., 1994, 1995; Bartsch et
al., 1995). Furthermore, CREB-binding protein (CBP), the
specific binding protein for phospho-CREB (pCREB) in
the active transcriptional complex (Chrivia et al., 1993),
displays a mutation in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, characterized by congenital malformation and mental retardation (Petrij et al., 1995).
This study focused on the cellular processes that regulate the phosphorylation state of CREB in hippocampal
neurons. pCREB was monitored at the single-cell level
with an antibody specific for phospho-Ser-133 (Ginty et
al., 1993). Synaptic activity simultaneously influenced
both CREB phosphorylation (by a phosphorylation cascade involving multiple Ca21/calmodulin [CaM]–dependent kinases) and pCREB dephosphorylation (through
calcineurin [CaN], a Ca2 1/CaM–dependent phosphatase). We found that the information contained in the
brief bursts of synaptic activity can be stored for a much
longer time scale, as embodied in the persistence of
pCREB. This occurred in part through activity-induced
inactivation of CaN, which affected the efficiency of
pCREB dephosphorylation by nuclear protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Induction of two CRE-dependent genes,
c-fos and somatostatin (SS), was found to depend on
the same stimulus parameters and signaling pathways
that control the persistence of nuclear pCREB.

Stimulus Duration Dependence of CRE-Mediated
Gene Expression Correlates with Sustained
Rather Than Transient pCREB in the Nucleus
We used c-Fos and SS-14 as markers of CRE-mediated
gene expression (Brindle and Montminy, 1992; Bading
et al., 1993). Ninety minutes after receipt of an electrical
stimulus for 18 s at 5 Hz (a frequency within the physiological range of synaptic activity in hippocampal neurons), levels of nuclear c-Fos immunoreactivity (IR) and
cytoplasmic SS-14-IR remained unchanged relative to
control; however, when the duration of the stimulus train
was increased to 180 s, the IR increased in a number of neurons (p < 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; Figure 1A).

dependent gene expression (Brindle and Montminy,
1992). Confocal analysis of nuclear pCREB-IR in hippocampal neurons, by means of an antibody specific for
CREB phosphorylated at Ser-133 (Ginty et al., 1993),
confirmed its bimodal distribution into IR-positive nuclei
or background and indicated that the proportion of the
IR-positive nuclei was consistent with that determined
by conventional epifluorescence microscopy (Bito et al.,
unpublished data). We found that the shorter stimulus
(18 s) at 5 Hz was as efficient as a longer stimulus
(180 s) in triggering an initial rise in pCREB (Figure 1B).
Prolongation of the stimulation did not significantly alter
the peak level of pCREB-IR or its cellular distribution
(data not shown). However, longer stimulation produced
greater stability in nuclear pCREB-IR over time, as monitored in neurons kept quiescent with tetrodotoxin (TTX)
(Figure 1B). This dependence of pCREB persistence on
the duration of stimulation was common to field stimulation at 5 Hz (Figure 1B) or 50 Hz (Figure 1C) and cellular
depolarization with 90 mM K1 (Figure 1D).
This series of experiments indicated that the rate of
decline of pCREB-IR was consistently regulated by the
duration of stimulation. The altered time course of
pCREB decay strongly increased its time integral and
might thus be expected to exert a substantial effect
on CRE-dependent transcription. Indeed, the greater
persistence of pCREB after a 3 min stimulus (Figures
1B–1D) was paralleled by increased expression of c-Fos
and SS-14 (Figure 1A).
Nuclear CaMKIV May Be Involved in CREB
Phosphorylation in Hippocampal Neurons
To clarify the biochemical mechanism underlying the
stimulus-duration dependence of pCREB and gene expression, we first sought to identify the nuclear CREB

kinase. Many Ser/Thr kinases can phosphorylate CREB
Ser-133. These include protein kinase A (PKA; Gonzalez
and Montminy, 1989), protein kinase C (PKC; Xie and
Rothstein, 1995), Ca21/CaM–dependent protein kinases
such as CaMKI (Sheng et al., 1991), CaMKII (Dash et
al., 1991; Sheng et al., 1991; Yoshida et al., 1995), and
CaMKIV (Cruzalegui and Means, 1993; Enslen et al.,
1994; Matthews et al., 1994; Sun et al., 1994), as well
as a Ras-dependent p105 kinase (Ginty et al., 1994), and
a pp90rsk (Bohm et al., 1995).
We used an array of potent kinase inhibitors to help
delineate the nature of the kinase (Figures 2A and 2B).
Staurosporine, a nonselective kinase inhibitor, largely
eliminated pCREB formation at high concentration. A
selective CaM kinase inhibitor, KN-93, significantly reduced CREB phosphorylation, whereas its inactive analog, KN-92, had no effect (Figures 2A and 2B). In contrast, pCREB formation was unaffected by saturating
doses of selective inhibitors of PKA, PKC, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase, and tyrosine kinases (Figure 2B). Taken together,
these data suggest that CaM kinase(s) are the main
regulator(s) of CREB phosphorylation in hippocampal
neurons.
Figure 2C compares subcellular distributions of
CaMKI, CaMKII (a and b isoforms), and CaMKIV, four
multifunctional CaM kinase isotypes expressed in hippocampus and capable of phosphorylating CREB in
vitro (Braun and Schulman, 1995). The similarity in the
pharmacology of the rise in pCREB at two ages—4 days
in vitro (div), when synaptic connections had not yet
formed, and >9 div, when evoked synaptic transmission
could be consistently recorded—suggested that the
CREB kinase might be expressed from early on in culture
(Figure 2B). At 4 div, CaMKIV was prominently expressed

in the nucleus; there also was a measurable amount
of CaMKI-IR and a faint hint of CaMKII-b, whereas
CaMKII-a was undetectable (Figure 2C, top row). After
synapse formation, at >9 div, all four members of the
CaM kinase family appeared in abundance (Figure 2C,
bottom row), but only CaMKIV showed a predominant
nuclear localization. These findings confirmed previous
studies in brain sections (Ito et al., 1994; Brocke et al.,
1995; Nakamura et al., 1995; Picciotto et al., 1995). The
lack of significant nuclear staining for CaMKII diminishes
the likelihood of a role for this kinase in CREB Ser-133
or Ser-142 phosphorylation (Sun et al., 1994). On these
grounds, CaMKIV must be regarded as a likely candidate
for CREB kinase in hippocampal neurons.
Suppression of Nuclear CaMKIV Disrupts
CREB Phosphorylation
We next sought evidence of a linkage between CaMKIV
expression and CREB phosphorylation. There was a
strong correlation between nuclear CaMKIV expression
and the depolarization-induced pCREB-IR at the singlecell level (Figure 3A, no oligos, p < 0.0001, x2 test). An
antisense strategy was used to establish a causal relationship. To manipulate nuclear levels of CaMKIV, two
antisense oligonucleotides (HN-1 and HN-3) were used
to target the translation initiation sites of the a- and
b-splice variants, respectively, of CaMKIV. Corresponding missense oligos (AD-2 and AD-4) served as controls.
Application of both antisense oligos together significantly decreased the number of neurons immunopositive for both CaMKIV and pCREB while augmenting the
pCREB2/CaMKIV2 category (Figures 3A–3C). Thus, the
correlation between CaMKIV expression and pCREB remained strong (p < 0.0001, x 2 test). Furthermore, the
antisense oligos did not alter total CREB-IR (Figure 3C,
right) or Ca2 1 influx monitored with fura-2 (data not
shown). In contrast, missense treatment left the patterns
of immunopositivity unchanged relative to untreated

neurons (Figures 3A–3C). With data from the other experiments, the antisense results provide compelling evidence of involvement of CaMKIV as CREB kinase in
Ca21-regulated CREB phosphorylation in hippocampal
neurons.
Possibility of a CaM Kinase Kinase Cascade
Studies of recombinant CaMKIV demonstrate a striking
activation upon phosphorylation by an upstream kinase
(Okuno et al., 1994; Selbert et al., 1995; Tokumitsu et
al., 1995). This prompted us to monitor phosphorylation
of CaMKIV during stimulation in metabolically 32Plabeled neurons. After 90 mM K1 depolarization, a >4fold increase in CaMKIV labeling was found relative to
a sham treatment (Figure 4A). This increase was blocked
in 0 Ca2 1/EGTA or by the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93,
indicating that CaMKIV activation by phosphorylation
depended on Ca21 influx and an upstream CaM kinase
(Figure 4A). Consistent with the phosphorylation data,
the same stimulus increased nuclear Ca2 1/CaM–
dependent (z2-fold increase, p < 0.05; Figure 4B) as well
as Ca21/CaM-independent (40% increase, p < 0.05; data
not shown) activities of CaMKIV. If CaMKIV activation
were significant for pCREB-dependent transcriptional
activation, a kinetic relationship between stimulusdependent phosphorylation of CaMKIV and formation
of the pCREB–CBP complex would be expected. Both
CaMKIV phosphorylation and pCREB–CBP complex formation reached a maximal level within 1 min of high K1
depolarization and did not further increase during the
next 2 min of depolarization (Figures 4C and 4D). Furthermore, both pCREB-CBP formation and CaMKIV
phosphorylation were sensitive to treatment with KN93, whereas a PKA inhibitor, KT5720, had little effect.
CaMKIV-mediated phosphorylation of CREB thus may
be critical for pCREB-CBP association.
Our results indicate that even a short (1 min) depolarization, which induces a rapid and maximal phosphorylation of CREB, also rapidly and maximally activates

CaMKIV and that this activation is mediated in part
through phosphorylation of CaMKIV by an upstream
CaM kinase kinase. It is thus likely that even brief stimulation facilitates formation of a stable pCREB–CBP complex through CaMKIV-induced CREB phosphorylation.
This process was not significantly facilitated by prolongation of the stimulus to 3 min, suggesting that it is not
the extent of the initial rise in pCREB that determines
its persistence.
Evidence That PP1 Mediates Nuclear
CREB Dephosphorylation
We turned next to PPs to determine whether control of
CREB dephosphorylation could underlie the stimulusduration dependence of CRE-mediated gene expression. IRs for both PP1 and PP2A, two major classes
of PPs that account for the majority of cellular protein
phosphatase activity (Cohen et al., 1990; Shenolikar,
1994), were clearly present in the nuclei of the cultured
hippocampal neurons (data not shown; see also Ouimet
et al., 1995). In contrast, CaN (PP2B), a Ca21/CaM–
dependent PP, was barely detectable in the nucleus
(Figure 5D). Okadaic acid (OA) was used to discriminate
between the possible effects of PP1 (block of which
requires micromolar OA) and PP2A, PPX/PP4, and PP5
(inhibited by OA in the 10 nM range) (Cohen et al., 1990;

Shenolikar, 1994; Nagao et al., 1995). A low dose (20 nM)
of OA failed to alter the decline of pCREB-IR following
synaptic stimulation or high K1 depolarization, whereas
a high dose (2 mM) of OA completely inhibited pCREB
dephosphorylation (Figures 5A and 5B). An inactive analog, 1-nor-okadaone (2 mM), had no effect, whereas calyculin A (5 nM), which blocks both PP1 and PP2A, completely prevented the CREB dephosphorylation (Figure
5C). None of the phosphatase inhibitors induced CREB
phosphorylation by themselves (data not shown). Because the pCREB phosphatase was sensitive to micromolar OA or calyculin A, it could be identified on pharmacological grounds as PP1.
CaN as a Negative Regulator of pCREB
CaN was discounted as the pCREB phosphatase, based
on its predominantly cytoplasmic location in the cultured
neurons (Figure 5D) and because OA blocked pCREB
dephosphorylation completely at 2 mM (Figure 5C), well
below the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of OA
for CaN (Cohen et al., 1990). The possibility still remained
that CaN might serve as a modulator and influence the
pCREB dephosphorylation by PP1, acting perhaps from
the cytoplasm. Following a brief stimulation, a significantly higher amount of pCREB persisted after 45 min
recovery in the presence of 1 mM FK506, a CaN inhibitor,

than with rapamycin (1 mM), an inactive analog (Figures
5E and 5F). Similar results were obtained after electrical
stimulation (50 Hz for 18 s) or after exposure to high K1
(Figure 5E). Contrary to the effect of OA (Figures 5A and
5B), FK506 did not prevent pCREB dephosphorylation
itself but clearly slowed the time course of the return to
baseline (Figures 5F, 5G, and 5I). This suggests that CaN
may promote pCREB dephosphorylation in the wake of
pCREB induction by a brief stimulus train. CaN is probably activated during a field stimulation, even at a frequency of 5 Hz, since the bulk cytoplasmic Ca21 concentration ([Ca21]i) under these conditions (Figure 6A) is
adequate for CaN activation (Stemmer and Klee, 1994).
We next examined the effect of FK506 following a longer
stimulus that was effective in giving rise to CRE-mediated gene expression (Figure 1A). When the same stimulus train was repeatedly applied with a 1 min interstimulus interval or when the stimulus was prolonged 10-fold
(from 18 to 180 s), FK506 no longer affected the decline
of pCREB (Figures 5H and 5J). Thus, increasing the
duration of the stimulus occluded the effect of CaN
inhibition. This implies that CaN itself, or signaling molecules downstream of CaN, became inactivated or inaccessible with longer stimulus duration.
Recent work from Klee and colleagues (Wang et al.,
1996) has suggested that CaN undergoes inactivation
upon prolonged conjunction of elevated levels of [Ca21]i
and superoxide anions (O22). This prompted us to examine both intracellular Ca2 1 and redox dynamics during
electrical stimulation of the hippocampal neurons. During a 180 s, 5 Hz train, we observed a maintained pedestal of [Ca21]i (in 13 of 13 neurons, averaging z150 nM),
whereas [Ca21]i fell toward the basal level of z50 nM
following an 18 s, 5 Hz train (Figure 6A). Prolonged electrical stimulation also induced a steadily increasing oxidative conversion of nonfluorescent dihydrorhodamine

6G into fluorescent rhodamine (Figure 6B). The zones
with increased oxidation of the probe were seen in both
soma and dendrites and tended to be juxtamembranous
and contiguous (Figure 6C). These data show that both
factors necessary for activity-induced inactivation of
CaN (Wang et al., 1996) can in fact be observed in the
hippocampal cells. As a further test of the involvement
of a reactive oxygen species in the control of pCREB,
we studied the effects of agents that interfere with production or inactivation of O22: N-tert-butyl-a-(2-sulfophenyl)-nitrone (S-PBN), an electron spin trap and a
strong radical scavenger, and diethyldithiocarbamic acid
(DDC), a Cu21 chelator that blocks superoxide dismutase
(SOD). In the presence of S-PBN, even a long stimulus
was incapable of delaying the pCREB decay, whereas
in the presence of DDC, even a short stimulus gave
rise to a persistent nuclear pCREB (Figures 6D and 6E).
These results support the hypothesis that synaptic stimulation increases oxidative activity and thereby promotes the inactivation of CaN (Wang et al., 1996), thus
slowing pCREB dephosphorylation.
CaN as a Negative Regulator of CRE-Mediated
Gene Expression
If CaN activity spells the difference between short- or
long-lived elevation of pCREB, inhibition of CaN might
allow even brief stimuli to trigger CRE-dependent transcription successfully. To test this idea, we monitored
the effect of CaN inhibition on c-Fos and SS-14 induction
(Figure 7) . Indeed, treatment with FK506 enabled short,
18 s stimuli to produce a significant increase in nuclear
c-Fos-IR and cytoplasmic SS-14-IR (p < 0.01, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), whereas the same stimulation had
failed to do so in the absence of CaN inhibition (Figure 1).
These data underscore the importance of CaN activity in

controlling the persistence of nuclear pCREB and the
occurrence of CRE-dependent nuclear events.

A CaM Kinase Cascade and CaN Control CREB
Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation
Our work indicates that activity at hippocampal synapses controls the phosphorylation state of CREB
through two opposing mechanisms, apparently both involving Ca21/CaM–regulated enzymes. A CaM kinase
cascade consisting of CaMKIV and a CaMKIV kinase
appeared to play a critical role in the formation of
pCREB. pCREB formation was rapid, reaching a plateau
within 1 min (unpublished data), in accordance with the
rapid activation kinetics of CaM kinases (Braun and
Schulman, 1995). This rapidity suggests that activation
of CaMKIV is achieved as the final step of a CaM kinase
cascade rather than by autophosphorylation (Cruzalegui
and Means, 1993; Okuno and Fujisawa, 1993; Selbert
et al., 1995; Tokumitsu et al., 1995). A kinase cascade
would confer noteworthy functional properties in nuclear signaling, including the potential for signal amplification and for convergence of multiple signals (Hill and
Treisman, 1995; Hunter, 1995), and may be appropriate
as part of a cell switch mechanism (Marshall, 1995; Huang and Ferrell, 1996). It will be relevant to identify upstream CaM kinase kinases and to determine their mode
of regulation. A similar CaMKIV cascade has been reported in T cells (Hanissian et al., 1993; Park and Soderling, 1995).
Our experiments suggest that once CREB is phosphorylated, the maintenance of this state is controlled by
regulation of a pCREB phosphatase. Our data implicate
PP1 as the pCREB phosphatase (Figure 5), consistent
with a previous work in PC-12 cells (Hagiwara et al.,
1992). We also have identified a novel role for cytoplasmic CaN in regulating the decline in pCREB. Inhibition of CaN retarded the decay of pCREB levels without
preventing its ultimate dephosphorylation (Figures 5F,
5G, and 5I). In principle, this effect could be explained
if CaN acted by inhibiting CaMKIV or its upstream activators, although no direct biochemical evidence for this
possibility is yet available. Another possibility is that
CaN acts by potentiating the PP1 pathway, presumably
by dephosphorylating a PP1 regulator, such as phospho-inhibitor 1, a PP1 inhibitor. We envision that activation of cytoplasmic CaN, by even brief bouts of synaptic
stimuli, would reduce cytoplasmic levels of phosphoinhibitor 1 and eventually diminish nuclear levels as well,
thereby potentiating nuclear PP1 activity and accelerating pCREB dephosphorylation. A similar role was attributed to CaN in the regulation of PP1 during the induction
of long-term depression at hippocampal synapses (Lisman, 1989; Malenka, 1994).
Because CaN is a Ca21/CaM–regulated enzyme, in
effect we are proposing that signals regulating phosphorylation and dephosphorylation both involve Ca21/

pCREB dephosphorylation after a stimulus train of 18 s at 5 Hz, but
not with 180 s at 5 Hz. Mean 6 SD, n 5 5. Asterisk, p , 0.05.

CaM (Figure 8). The bidirectional nature of this synaptic
control of CREB seems to be well suited for inducing a
transient pulse of CREB phosphorylation. The transience of this CREB peak after brief stimulation appears
to be responsible for the inability of brief stimulation to
induce CRE-dependent gene expression (Figure 1A).
A Synaptically Controlled, Stimulus Duration–Sensitive
Mechanism for Transcription
Our results provide fundamental information about the
features of neural inputs that are encoded by CREB
phosphorylation. When we compared the time course
of pCREB decay following short and long stimulus trains,
at frequencies and durations appropriate to induce synaptic potentiation or depression (Deisseroth et al., 1996),
we found that it was the duration of the synaptic activity
rather than its frequency that determined how long
pCREB remained increased above basal levels (Figures
1B and 1D). Lengthening of the stimulus duration from
z1 to 3 min greatly prolonged the residual nuclear
pCREB (Figures 1B–1D) and also produced an increase
in the expression of CRE-regulated gene products c-Fos
and SS-14 (Figure 1A). Thus, the temporal extension of
the pCREB signal may serve as a stimulus duration–

sensitive switch for turning on CRE-mediated transcription. The sustained presence of pCREB in the nucleus
may ensure stabilization of the pCREB–CBP complex
that is necessary for efficient CRE-regulated gene expression; a preinitiation complex must be stabilized to
maintain ongoing transcription, as recently demonstrated in vivo by Ho et al. (1996). A similar example of
a Ca2 1-dependent, duration-sensitive pathway has been
noted in gene induction by nuclear factor of activated T
cells (NFAT) (reviewed in Crabtree and Clipstone, 1994).
In contrast, what is the significance of the clear but
transient rise in pCREB evoked by brief stimuli? It might
simply represent the behavior of the switch mechanism
as a filter to screen out weak inputs. Another possibility
is that the transient pCREB signal may be sufficient
to promote transcription in a subset of CRE-regulated
genes that are more predisposed to activation than
those studied here. Alternatively, the pCREB transient
might provide a priming signal, which could act in combination with an otherwise ineffective input to produce
a nuclear effect. The potential importance of such a
priming action is supported by studies showing that
dephosphorylated CREB can act as a dominant negative
regulator of CRE-dependent gene expression mediated

by other CRE-binding transcription factors (Vallejo et
al., 1995).
CaN as a Key Element in the Duration-Sensitive
Gene Expression Switch
The prolonged detection of pCREB in the nucleus was
not only functionally important; it also was surprising in
mechanistic terms because it could not be explained
by kinase regulation. Because CREB formation and
pCREB–CBP complex formation reached a plateau
within the first minute of stimulation (Figure 4C), merely
lengthening the stimulus by z2 min would be expected
only to yield a trivial increase in the persistence of nuclear pCREB and not the prolongation by 20–30 min that
actually was observed (Figures 1B–1D). These observations provided early clues that there may be a different
kind of regulatory mechanism, one involving control of
phosphatase activity.
Our experiments show that CaN is an important player
in conditioning the switch mechanism (Figures 5–7).
There are three major findings. First, when CaN was
blocked by FK506, short stimulus trains became as potent as long stimuli in promoting increases in pCREB,
with critical consequences for CRE-dependent gene expression. Of note, FK506 has also been reported to augment pCREB-IR and c-Fos-IR in organotypic slices of
the striatum (Liu and Graybiel, 1996). Second, after prolonged stimulation, pCREB-IR could not be further increased by FK506. Third, local, synaptically stimulated
generation of O22 or a related oxidative species appeared to be critical in regulating the stimulus duration
dependence of pCREB dephosphorylation.
The first finding suggests that CaN is involved in accelerating the decay of pCREB, thus uncoupling CRE-regulated gene expression in the wake of a brief stimulus

train. The second result implies that the stimulus duration dependence and CaN dependence are mutually occlusive. Finally, the third observation is consistent with
a model in which inactivation of CaN is induced in a
Ca2 1-dependent, activation-specific manner (Stemmer
et al., 1995) by a change in its redox state, possibly by
the action of O2 2 and regulated by SOD (Wang et al.,
1996). Further studies are clearly needed to elucidate
fully the role of synaptically induced O22 release and
its physiological effect on various neuronal signaling
pathways.
Neurobiological Perspectives and Significance
Experiments in Aplysia and Drosophila have shown the
importance of PKA-dependent signaling both in CREinduced transcription and in long-term memory (DeZazzo
and Tully, 1995; Mayford et al., 1995). However, evidence
linking PKA to memory is lacking in mammals; in fact,
PKA-deficient mice appeared normal with regard to
learning and long-term memory, although late long-term
potentiation and long-term depression were perturbed
(Huang et al., 1995). Furthermore, our findings have
failed to link PKA to CREB phosphorylation, indicating
that the mammalian hippocampal CREB pathway may
be distinct from those characterized in invertebrates
(Mayford et al., 1995).
PKA may be involved in some other aspects of CREmediated gene expression in mammals. Indeed, evidence from PC-12 cells has shown that a basal level of
PKA activity is required for CRE-mediated gene expression though not essential for CREB phosphorylation itself (Brindle et al., 1995; Thompson et al., 1995). In an
acute hippocampal slice preparation, CRE activation
induced by a protocol of late long-term potentiation was
shown to be mediated at least in part by Ca2 1-induced

Synaptic Control of CREB Phosphorylation

Figure 8. CREB as a Stimulus Duration–Sensitive Switch in Hippocampal Gene Expression
(Top) The persistence of pCREB (hour time scale) can be sharply
altered by changes in stimulus duration (minute time scale) by a
switch regulated by kinases and phosphatases. Prolonged stimulation induces inactivation of the phosphatase pathway, allowing the
temporal persistence of nuclear pCREB, which appears critical in
the signaling that leads to activation of CRE-regulated genes.
(Bottom) A working model of Ca21/CaM–mediated, bidirectional
control of pCREB in the nucleus. Synaptic Ca21 entry triggers a
submembranous increase in [Ca21]i, which in turn activates a Ca21/
CaM–dependent process leading to a trans-phosphorylation of nuclear CaMKIV, possibly by a CaM kinase kinase. Dephosphorylation
of CREB is mediated by a nuclear phosphatase with sensitivity to
high OA, presumably PP1. CaN is depicted as causing an acceleration in CREB dephosphorylation rate; a possible target for CaN is
phospho-inhibitor-1, acting as an inhibitory subunit of PP1 when
phosphorylated. This scheme can account for the results summarized (top). During a brief stimulus, simultaneous activation of both
kinase and phosphatase pathways ensures that pCREB elevation
will be large but brief. Longer stimuli cause prolongation of nuclear
pCREB, possibly by inhibition of CaN via O22, thus hampering the
phosphatase pathway. Similarly, when CaN is blocked pharmacologically, even brief stimuli can bring about a prolonged pCREB
transient. CaCh, calcium channel.

stimulation of PKA (Impey et al., 1996). PKA could also
act as a gate to modify the efficiency of postsynaptic
signaling pathways required for CREB phosphorylation,
while not being directly responsible for it (Blitzer et al.,
1995). Furthermore, phosphorylation of CBP by PKA or
mitogen-activated protein kinase may be required to
enhance transactivation potential of CBP (Janknecht
and Hunter, 1996). Further investigation should clarify
the interactions between Ca21-dependent pathways and
other signaling cascades.
An additional layer of transcriptional regulation may
be provided by parallel recruitment of CREB activators
and inhibitors, the difference or ratio of which is critical
for gene expression (Bartsch et al., 1995; Yin et al., 1995).
The relative rate of decay of activator and inhibitor after
each individual trial is critical in such systems (Yin et

al., 1995). Slowing the decay of the activator relative to
the counteracting inhibitor would greatly increase the
accumulation of the resultant of these opposing signals.
Our results raise the possibility that activity-induced inactivation of CaN might prove important for accumulation of the net differential between activator and inhibitor
signals in mammalian hippocampal neurons.
Although we have delineated pathways by which synaptic activity controls CRE-dependent gene expression,
we do not know which of the many candidate CREregulated genes are vital in memory formation. CREB
might be involved in regulating neuronal properties such
as action potential firing (e.g., through the K1 channel
Kv1.5), neurotransmitter release (e.g., through synapsin
I), or postsynaptic responsiveness (e.g., through CaMKII-a). We also do not know whether the duration-dependent gene expression switch outlined here participates
in memory formation in vivo. However, one implication
of our results is that perturbation of CaN function might
have noteworthy effects on the protein synthesis–
dependent phase of long-term memory. This prediction
apparently has been verified recently in a chick learning
model (Bennett et al., 1996). Further tests in CaN knockout mice (Zhang et al., 1996) or in other organisms such
as Drosophila are desirable. The identification of novel
mechanisms by which synaptic activity controls expression of CRE-dependent genes raises further questions
about their role in physiological events (e.g., alteration
of synaptic strength, apoptosis, and formation and elimination of synapses), as well as in pathological processes
(e.g., epilepsy or ischemic injury).

Experimental Procedures
Electrical Stimulation, Pharmacological Manipulation,
and Immunocytochemical Analysis
of Hippocampal Neurons
Hippocampal neurons were cultured as described by Deisseroth et
al. (1996). After preincubation at room temperature for 2 hr in Tyrode
containing 2 mM Ca21/2 mM Mg21/10 mM glycine/1 mM TTX, neurons
were stimulated either by electrical field stimulation (z0.5 mA, 1 ms
current pulses applied across the coverslip) or by depolarization
with 90 mM K1. Field stimulation was applied after removal of TTX,
whereas high K 1 depolarization was done in TTX. Neurons were
immediately fixed (30 s after field stimulation or within 5 s after high
K 1 stimulation) or returned to Tyrode/TTX.
When used, kinase inhibitors were present during a preincubation
period of 20–30 min and also during stimulation. Phosphatase inhibitors were usually applied only after field stimulation, but with high
K 1 stimulation, they also were included during the last 45 min of
preincubation; in all phosphatase inhibitor experiments, TTX, D-AP5
(50 mM), and CNQX (10 mM) were included to avoid effects due to
modification of synaptic transmission. Exposure to the O22 modulatory drugs began 30 min prior to stimulation and continued during
the 45 min recovery period. Effects of synaptic activity on gene
expression were measured by incubation of neurons at 378C for 90
min in Tyrode/TTX after synaptic stimulation at room temperature
as described above.
Immunofluorescent staining was performed as described (Deisseroth et al., 1996). Specimens were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot
epifluorescence microscope (courtesy of R. H. Scheller) or with an
MDI MultiProbe 2010 confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM)
at the Cell Sciences Imaging Facility, Beckman Center. Scoring of
CREB phosphorylation by nuclear pCREB positivity was based on
Alberts et al. (1994) and was performed as described (Deisseroth
et al., 1996). Photomicrographs were obtained directly on film or as
8-bit TIFF files. The CLSM laser power was adjusted for each series

Cell
1212

of experiments to make the best use of the 8-bit scale of the photomultipliers. Nuclear localization was verified by costaining with DAPI
or by scanning z-series sections on a CLSM. Data were analyzed
off-line with ImageSpace (MDI); values were mean signal intensity
collected over an area of 2.5–5 mm2 in either a midnuclear section
(for pCREB, CREB, and c-Fos-IRs), or in a region of cytoplasm
adjacent to the nucleus (for SS-14-IR). Histogram distribution and
statistical tests were analyzed with Origin 4.0 (Microcal) and StatViewII (Abacus). Representative images are shown (n 5 3–5).
Antibodies were as follows. Polyclonal antibodies were antipCREB (UBI, 1:500 dilution); anti-CREB (UBI, 1:1000); anti-CaMKI
(a gift from Dr. A. Nairn, 1:50; see Picciotto et al., 1995); anti-CaMKIIb
(Transduction Laboratories, 1:250); anti-PP1 catalytic subunit (UBI,
1:200); anti-PP2A catalytic subunit (UBI, 1:200; Promega, 1:200);
anti-c-Fos (Ab-2, Oncogene Science, 1:200); and anti-SS-14 (Chemicon, 1:200). Monoclonal antibodies were anti-CaMKII-a (clone
CBa-2, Life-Technologies, 1:200; clone 6G9, Boehringer-Mannheim,
1:500); anti-CaMKIIb (clone CBb-1, Life Technologies); anti-CaMKIV
(Transduction Laboratories, 1:200); anti-CaN regulatory subunit
(clone VA-1, UBI, 1:250); anti-CaN catalytic subunit (clone CN-A1,
Sigma, 1:250); and anti-synaptophysin (clone SY38, BoehringerMannheim, 1:250).
Sources of drugs were LC Laboratories (OA, calyculin A, 1-norokadaone, and KT5720), Calbiochem (Rp-cAMPS, KT5720, OA, chelerythrine, TTX, and rapamycin), BIOLOG (Rp-cAMPS, Rp-8-ClcAMPS, Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS, and Rp-8-Br-cGMPS), Seikagaku
(KN-93 and KN-92), Biomol (genistein, tyrphostin A47, and lavendustin A), Kyowa Medix (staurosporine and K252a), RBI (D-AP5 and
CNQX), Sigma (DDC), Aldrich (S-PBN), and NEB (PD98059).
18-Mer antisense (HN-1: 59-GTGACTTTGAGCATCTTC-39; HN-3:
59-GCAACTCATGTTTCCTGG-39; both targeted tosequences around
the translation initiation sites for CaMKIV-a and CaMKIV-b, respectively) and missense oligonucleotides (AD-2: 59-GTGTCTTAGAG
CAACTTC-39; AD-4: 59-GCAACACAAGTATCCTGG-39) were based
on published rat CaMKIV cDNA sequences (Sakagami and Kondo,
1993) and synthesized by Oligos Etc. Phosphorothioate modification
was restricted to the three bases at both ends of the oligos to
reduce the nonspecific effects and cytotoxicity observed with fully
phosphorothioated oligos. A final 5 mM solution of each oligo, either
alone or in combination, was added to the culture medium immediately after plating and until 4 div, when the experiments were performed. The medium was changed every 24 hr, with the same concentration of oligos throughout the experiment.

Measurements of Rise in [Ca21]i and Production
of Oxygen Radicals
[Ca21]i imaging was conducted using a Nikon 40x Fluor objective
(N. A. 1.3), a Videoscope ICCD camera, a Sutter filter wheel–shutter
assembly, and software from Universal Imaging. Neurons were incubated for 1 hr in 1 mM fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) at room temperature. Calibrations were performed by measuring the 340 nm/380
nm ratio at known concentration of [Ca21]i in a whole-cell patch
pipette, and [Ca21]i was calculated as described (Grynkiewicz et al.,
1985).
Generation of reactive oxygen species was measured with dihydrorhodamine 6G (Molecular Probes) as described by Dugan et al.
(1995). A 10 mM solution of dihydorhodamine 6G was prepared in
Tyrode subjected to 30 min deoxygenation by sparging with N2.
Neurons were loaded for 30 min at room temperature, and rhodamine fluorescence was monitored on-line with 240 ms exposures;
data were digitized with a Matrox LC board and analyzed off-line.
Other dihydrorhodamine derivatives gave similar results; we found
dihydrofluorescein derivatives difficult to use owing to rapid photoconversion.

Phosphorylation Assay and Immunoblot Analysis
To monitor activity-dependent phosphorylation of CaMKIV and
CREB, neurons grown on dishes were prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate (1.5 mCi/ml, Amersham) during the last 45 min of TTX
pretreatment. After 90 mM K1 stimulation, neurons were washed
with ice-cold PBS(2) and immediately frozen on liquid N2 . Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 48C from total cell lysates (200 ml)
prepared in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl,
1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, Complete protease
inhibitor tablet [Boehringer-Mannheim], 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA,
10 nM calyculin A, and 1 mM sodium vanadate), using 2.5 mg of the
anti-CaMKIV monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) or 2
mg of anti-CBP polyclonal antibody recognizing the N-terminal end
of CBP (A-22, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were
separated with 10% SDS-PAGE, and 32P incorporation was measured with a PhosphorImager (MDI).
For immunoblots, neurons were lysed with boiling SDS-PAGE
buffer, electrophoresed, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After a blocking reaction (5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered
saline, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween-20), primary antibodies (anti-pCREB,
1:2500; anti-CREB, 1:5000; and anti-CaMKIV, 1:1000) were incubated overnight at 48C in the blocking buffer. After incubation with
a secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit [or anti-mouse]
antibody [Cappel, 1:2000]), the membrane was further probed with
an HRP-conjugated anti-biotin antibody (NEB, 1:1000); an ECL procedure followed (Amersham).
Nuclear extracts from hippocampal neurons were prepared according to a published procedure (Andrews and Faller, 1991) and
were assayed for CaMKIV activity using peptide-g (Biomol) as a
substrate as described (Okuno et al., 1994).
