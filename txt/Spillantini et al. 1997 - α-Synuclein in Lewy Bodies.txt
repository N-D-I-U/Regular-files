a-Synuclein in
Lewy bodies
Lewy bodies, a defining pathological characteristic of Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)1–4, constitute
the second most common nerve cell pathology, after the neurofibrillary lesions of
Alzheimer’s disease. Their formation may
cause neurodegeneration, but their biochemical composition is unknown. Neurofilaments and ubiquitin are present5–8, but it
is unclear whether they are major components of the filamentous material of the
Lewy body9,10. Here we describe strong
staining of Lewy bodies from idiopathic
Parkinson’s disease with antibodies for asynuclein, a presynaptic protein of unknown function which is mutated in some
familial cases of the disease11. a-Synuclein
may be the main component of the Lewy
body in Parkinson’s disease. We also show
staining for a-synuclein of Lewy bodies
from DLB, indicating that the Lewy bodies
from these two diseases may have identical
compositions.
We studied formalin- or ethanol-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue sections of substantia nigra from six patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, and from four
patients with DLB (all clinically and neuropathologically confirmed cases), as well as

cingulate cortex from the DLB patients (one
with additional Alzheimer’s disease pathology). We stained the tissue with affinitypurified, anti-a-synuclein serum PER2
(diluted 1:200)12. This antibody, raised
against a synthetic peptide corresponding
to residues 116–131 of human a-synuclein,
specifically recognizes a-synuclein on
immunoblots of human cerebral cortex
extracts and does not cross-react with the
related b-synuclein12. We also stained the
sections with anti-b-synuclein serum PER3
(diluted 1:200) raised against a peptide corresponding to residues 99–111 of human bsynuclein12. As an absorption control we

pre-incubated diluted PER2 overnight at
4 °C with 10 mM recombinant human asynuclein. For immunohistochemistry we
used avidin–biotin, with diaminobenzidine
as the chromogen6,12.
Substantia nigra sections from Parkinson’s disease and DLB, and cingulate cortex
sections from DLB and DLB with
Alzheimer’s disease incubated with the asynuclein antibody PER2 showed staining
of numerous brainstem-type and cortical
Lewy bodies (Figs 1 and 2). Lewy neurites,
which are dystrophic processes with the
same immunohistochemical staining profile
as Lewy bodies, were also reactive (Figs 1a,
2a). The strong staining made it difficult to
distinguish between the core and the corona
of the brainstem-type Lewy bodies (Figs 1,
2b). The staining was specific, and did not
occur after pre-adsorption of the primary
antibody with recombinant a-synuclein.
We obtained similar results with antibody PER1, raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 11–34 of
human a-synuclein, indicating that fulllength a-synuclein may be present in the
Lewy body (data not shown). We found no
specific staining of Lewy bodies or Lewy
neurites with the b-synuclein antibody
PER3.
We also stained tissue sections from
Parkinson’s disease and DLB with the
ubiquitin monoclonal antibody 1510
(Chemicon, diluted 1:500)13. Double-staining of substantia nigra sections from
Parkinson’s disease with PER2 and 1510,
showed staining of similar numbers of Lewy
bodies and neurites with each antibody.
Similarly, in adjacent tissue sections of substantia nigra and cingulate cortex from
DLB, we found comparable numbers of
Lewy bodies and neurites stained with
PER2, antibody 1510 or undiluted neurofilament antibody RMO32, a monoclonal
antibody to a phosphorylated epitope in the
mid-sized neurofilament subunit which

specifically recognizes Lewy bodies6. Cortical Lewy bodies immunoreactive to PER2
had a similar morphology to the ubiquitinand neurofilament-positive Lewy bodies in
that they had round, oval or irregular
shapes and frequently displaced the nucleus
to one side (Fig. 2c).
The strong a-synuclein staining of
brainstem-type and cortical Lewy bodies in
idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and DLB
shows that a-synuclein is a component of
the Lewy body. In some familial cases of
Parkinson’s disease there is an alanine to
threonine mutation at residue 53 of asynuclein11. A major effect of this mutation
may be to promote the aggregation of
a-synuclein into filaments, resulting in the
formation of Lewy bodies. The Parkinson’s
disease cases that we studied were nonfamilial, so at least two distinct pathogenetic mechanisms can lead to a-synuclein
aggregation. a-Synuclein aggregation and
Lewy-body formation may be important in
the aetiology and pathogenesis of all cases
of Parkinson’s disease.
As brainstem-type and cortical Lewy
bodies from DLB were strongly immunoreactive for a-synuclein, a-synuclein aggregation may also underlie Lewy-body
formation in this condition. The intracytoplasmic Lewy body is therefore central to
the neurodegenerative process, and both
Parkinson’s disease and DLB may be asynuclein diseases.

expansion of xenotransplantation.

Endogenous proviruses
as “mementos”?
In a recent News and Views1, J. P. Stoye discussed the potential health risks associated
with the spread of endogenous proviruses
from pigs and primates through the use
of their organs for transplantation into
humans. Although the risks to patients and
the public from horizontal transmission may
be as manageable as he represents, we would
like to comment on his reference to the presence of vertically transmitted proviruses in
the genomes of all mammals as “mementos”.
The spread of such parasites throughout
the genome of a species is expected to be
accompanied by a large number of additional ‘random’ insertions. Many (perhaps
most) of these insertions will be associated
with mutations that are ultimately eliminated by natural selection, so the “mementos”
are the surviving insertions, those with minimal effects on the host’s fitness. For example, laboratory experiments show that the
recent and rapid spread of the P element
throughout the genomes of all Drosophila
melanogaster in nature was accompanied by
enormous transient net reductions in fertility and viability in the population2,3. But in a
few thousand Drosophila generations, there
will be only “mementos” of the P element in
the genomes of D. melanogaster (much as in
seen in other species of Drosophila).
The apparently innocuous presence of
these parasites does not mean that they
have not caused a great toll in the past. Further, there is evidence that host genomes
may have evolved the ability to repress rapid
transposition of families of retroviruses4 or
retrotransposable elements5, so that mutation of the relevant genes leads to element
mobilization. There is therefore a risk that
xenotransplantation could result in such
mobilization in a foreign genetic background that lacks appropriate genes to
repress transposition. Indeed, Stoye notes
that mammalian hosts have evolved “adaptations of host viral-receptor proteins” that
contain the spread of the endogenous
proviruses. The ubiquitous presence of such
effective adaptations implies a strong selective force (differential viability and/or fertility) on the hosts in the past.
In the absence of effective control of
reproduction, there is a real risk that a
germline infection in a xenotransplantation
patient could introduce a new and potentially virulently mutagenic endogenous
provirus into the human gene pool.
Although the risks associated with insertional mutations are distributed over future
generations, they are nevertheless great and
worthy of serious consideration in the evaluation of risks and benefits inherent to an

Stoye replies — On the basis of analogies
between P elements and retroviruses, Langley and Charlesworth suggest that one
potential risk associated with xenotransplantation is a form of insertional mutagenesis
resulting from germline integrations by
retroviruses derived from endogenous proviruses in the engrafted organs. I agree that
these elements are potentially hazardous, but
I am not convinced that the threat posed by
this form of genomic bombardment is great
enough to figure significantly in risk–benefit
analysis of xenotransplantation. Rather, the
much greater risk is that posed by these elements acting as infectious agents of disease.
Experiments in mice show that exogenous infection by retroviruses6, or activation
of endogenous proviruses7, can result in
germline infection. However, even under the
most favourable circumstances, the number
of acquired proviruses seems to be less than
one per generation, of which at most one in
ten is likely to be mutagenic8,9. Increases in
the number of germline proviruses will
require further cycles of maternal expression
followed by oocyte infection10, a process predicted to be significantly less efficient than
P-element mobilization associated with
hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila.
To pose any significant risk to human
fitness, a very high frequency of horizontal
retroviral transmission (followed by infection of the germ line) would be required.
For horizontal transmission on such a scale
to occur, levels of viraemia associated with
unacceptably high probabilities of virally
induced disease would almost certainly
have to occur. Several groups are currently
addressing the question of whether xenotransplantation procedures pose any threat
of infectious disease; provided that this concern is met, the threat to the human gene
pool seems exceedingly remote.
