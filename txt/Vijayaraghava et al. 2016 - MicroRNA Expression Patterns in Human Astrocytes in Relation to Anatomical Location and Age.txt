INTRODUCTION

Abstract
Anatomic distribution and age are variables linked to functions of
astrocytes under physiologic and pathologic conditions. We measured
the relative expression of a panel of microRNAs (miRNAs) in astrocytes captured by laser micro-dissection from normal human adult
white and grey matter, human fetal white matter and germinal matrix
samples. Although expression of most miRNAs was comparable between adult and fetal samples, regional differences were observed. In
the adult cerebral cortex, expression of miRNAs in morphologically
distinct inter-laminar astrocytes underlying the glial limitans differed
from those in deeper cortical layers, suggesting functional specialization possibly related to structural stability and defense from potentially
harmful factors in the cerebrospinal fluid. Differences between adult
white and grey matter miRNA expression included higher expression
of pro-inflammatory miRNAs in the former, potentially contributing to
differences in inflammation between grey and white matter plaques in
multiple sclerosis. Lower expression of miRNAs in fetal versus adult
white matter astrocytes likely reflects the immaturity of these migrating
cells. Highly expressed miRNAs in the fetal germinal matrix are probably relevant in development and also recapitulate some responses to
injury. Future studies can address regional alterations of miRNA expression in pathological conditions.

The wide array of functions performed by astrocytes under physiological and pathological conditions is influenced by
anatomic distribution and age (1–3). The physiological roles of
astrocytes during development include participation in neurogenesis, guidance of neural cell migration, blood-brain barrier
and glial limitans formation, and regulation of myelination. In
the mature CNS, astrocytes contribute to structural stability,
maintenance of blood-brain barrier function and neuronal synapses, tissue homeostasis and myelin maintenance. Under pathological conditions, astrocytes and their secreted products participate in tissue reactions to injury, neuroprotective responses,
and repair processes by acting on specific neural cell targets
and regulating immune cell reactivity.
Since the time of Cajal, astrocytes have been categorized
into 2 broad morphologies: protoplasmic with short and highly
branched processes, and fibrous astrocytes with long unbranched processes. Astrocytes in the white matter are usually
described as fibrous, whereas grey matter astrocytes are protoplasmic. White matter fibrous astrocytes in the mature brain
are largely derived from the fetal radial glial cells as well as
other germinal matrix precursors; grey matter astrocytes have
migrated from the germinal matrix in the second half of gestation. It is not clear whether these morphologic differences reflect intrinsic cell properties or result from the distinct anatomical structural features of the cellular grey matter as opposed to
the isomorphic nature of the axonal tracts in the white matter.
White matter astrocytes are less vulnerable to injury compared
to grey matter astrocytes in MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion) mouse models of ischemia (4). This may reflect an
overall lower metabolic demand on cells in the white matter
compared to those in the cortex. In situ studies have demonstrated that fetal astrocytes produce less scarring than adult
astrocytes in response to injury (5). Human fetal-derived astrocytes in vitro have a significantly higher rate of proliferation
and an increased expression of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6 (IL-6) transcripts compared to cells derived from the
adult CNS (6). This is seen both under basal conditions and in
response to interferon-c and lipopolysaccharide.
The aim of this study was to compare microRNA
(miRNA) expression profiles in astrocytes captured directly
in situ from white and grey matter samples of normal human
adult and fetal brains. miRNAs are small non-coding RNA

molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. We measured levels of a panel of 20 miRNAs that were
selected based on the following criteria: a) miRNAs whose
function in astrocytes is already known; b) miRNAs that are
highly expressed in astrocytes; c) miRNAs that are upregulated in ischemic tissue injury; d) miRNAs with differential
regional distribution in brain; and e) inflammation-related
miRNA in cells other than astrocytes (Table). We used laser
capture micro-dissection (LCM) to obtain glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive astrocytes from adult
white and cortical grey matter, and from cerebral white matter and germinal matrix of the fetal brain samples.
The known relative absence of GFAP-positive identifiable astrocytes in the grey matter of second trimester fetal
brains precluded their inclusion in our analyses. Developing
astrocytes in these regions express the fetal intermediate filament protein vimentin, which is only later co-expressed with
and eventually totally replaced by GFAP (7). In adult samples, given the distinct morphology of astrocytes, including
their relationship to the glial limitans, we compared miRNA
expression in astrocytes dissected from the superficial cortical layers (inter-laminar, layers 1-2) (8), from deeper cortical
layers, and from white matter. In fetal samples, we also included astrocytes found within the germinal matrix because
these cells play important roles in the proliferation, differentiation and migration of neural progenitor cells (9).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Immunohistochemistry and LCM
Adult human brain specimens ages 24 to 76 years without recognizable pathology were obtained from the archives of
the pathology laboratory of the Montreal Neurological Institute; second trimester fetal specimens (ages 17-20 weeks) were
obtained from the Department of Pathology, Alberta Children’s Hospital, University of Calgary (Supplementary Table).
The fetal ages were selected based both on their correspondence with existent in vitro studies (i.e. fetal astrocytes cultures
are mostly derived from second trimester brains) and as a time
of vulnerability to pre-natal insults. The use of the tissue samples in this study received the approval of McGill Research
Ethics Board (Montréal Neurological Institute).
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections
were immunostained with the Ventana Benchmark XT stainer
using an antibody against GFAP (Ventana cat # 760-4345, clone
#EPG724, Cell Marque, CA). Cells were visualized using secondary antibody conjugated to 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB).
DAB immunostaining has been previously used for LCM-based
transcriptome analysis (10). Captures were performed on 2
slides from each of 3 adult and fetal cases. GFAP-positive cells
(25 cells) were captured separately from different brain regions using the PALM-LCM system (Carl Zeiss, North York,
Ontario, Canada). Cells were captured from grey and white matter of normal adult brain sections. In the grey matter, astrocytes
were captured separately from cortical layers 1-2 (inter-laminar
astrocytes), and from the deeper layers (layers 2-6) (Figs. 1, 7).
White matter and germinal matrix astrocytes were captured
from fetal brain sections (Figs. 1, 7). We used hematoxylin and

In Situ miRNA Expression in Human Astrocytes

eosin-stained sections as guides from each case to identify different regions for capture. Captures across samples were normalized for laser power as well as for area of capture. Collected
samples were immediately lysed in Isol-RNA lysis reagent (5
Prime, Hamburg, Germany) and stored at 80 C until further
processing.

RNA Isolation, Preamplification Polymerase
Chain Reaction and Quantitative Polymerase
Chain Reaction
Total RNA was extracted from astrocytes using stanR
dard TrizolV
protocols followed by DNase treatment according to manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
Multiplexed reverse transcription (RT) reactions were performed with a pool of miRNA-specific RT primers (a pool
that included RT primers for all the miRNAs in the study) usR
ing a TaqManV
miRNA RT kit. cDNAs from laser-captured
samples were subjected to a pre-amplification reaction using
R
a pooled set of TaqManV
miRNA-specific probes to increase
the number of target copies, as previously described for lasercaptured FFPE samples (11, 12). Individual miRNA expression assays were performed using specific miRNA TaqMan
probes to assess expression relative to RNU48, a stable human small nuclear RNA, which is a widely used endogenous
reference (12–15). We found stable expression of this small
nuclear RNA in all the samples analyzed (Supplementary
Graph 1). miRNA expression analyses were performed using
negative D cycle time, –(D Ct) values. Although the D Ct values have been previously used for analyzing miRNA expression data (14, 16), we used –(D Ct) values, which allow easier
visualization of expression data on the graphs (i.e. a higher –
(D Ct) value represents higher expression and a lower value
depicts lower expression of individual miRNA). The panel of
20 miRNAs analyzed is listed in the Table.

miRNA Data and Statistical Analyses
The color gradient map depicting –(D Ct) values was preR
pared using the SAS software (JMPV
11). The principal component analysis (PCA) biplot and the hierarchical cluster data were
generated using NIA (National Institute of Aging) array analysis
tool available online (http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/ANOVA/in
dex.html). The –(D Ct) values are presented as mean 6 SEM in
all graphs. For comparisons spanning the different regions of the
adult brain, an one-way ANOVA was performed. For all other
comparisons, an unpaired Student t test was used for the evaluation of all comparisons. All tests resulting with a p value <0.05
were considered significant. These tests were done using GraphPad Prism software (version 5.0).

RESULTS
Morphologic Comparisons of GFAP-Positive
Cells in Adult and Fetal Brains
In adults, the protoplasmic astrocytes in the deeper layers
of grey matter (layers II/III-VI) showed an abundant radial network of GFAP-positive processes (Fig. 1A, B); the processes of
fibrous astrocytes in white matter (Fig. 1C) were elongated and

oriented along the axonal fibers. The inter-laminar (layers I-II)
astrocytes were distinguished by their number, distinctive linear
arrangement, prominence of GFAP staining, and prominent processes often in a radial distribution extending to the glial limitans (Fig. 1A). The cell bodies of adult astrocytes in white and
grey matter were larger and more readily recognizable than
those in fetal brains (Fig. 1D-F). The germinal matrix had many
cells with filamentous radial processes thicker than those of the
fetal white matter. GFAP-positive cells were rarely observed in
fetal grey matter.

Comparison of miRNA Expression in Astrocytes
From Different Regions of Adult and Fetal Brains
Comparisons were made between miRNA expression
profiles in cells captured from the superficial (inter-laminar
or layers I/II), the deeper cortical grey matter (layers II/IIIVI), and the white matter of adult brain, as well as the white
matter and germinal matrix (subventricular zone) of the fetal
brain by LCM (Figs. 2-7). Figure 2A provides a color gradient map representing –(D Ct) values of all the miRNAs studied in GFAP-positive cells from the selected regions in adult
and fetal tissue. The PCA was performed to visualize the variances in the pattern of overall miRNA expression across all
regions and samples (Fig. 2B, C). Lower variances were observed between cells from adult deep grey and white matter.
The miRNA expression of cells from the fetal germinal matrix region more closely resembled those from adult deep
grey matter and adult white matter. Although differing
greatly from each other, adult inter-laminar astrocytes and fetal white matter astrocytes were both outliers compared to the
other 3 regions (Figs. 2B, C). Hierarchical clustering of the
miRNA expression data reflects these same similarities and
variances (Fig. 2C).
The following significant individual differences were
observed between various regions and developmental time
points. The functional implications of these expression differences are summarized in the Table.

miRNAs Differentially Expressed in
Inter-laminar Astrocytes
miRNAs -129, -181a, -210, -214 and -365 were not detected in inter-laminar astrocytes captured from layers 1-2, a

contrast with either deeper grey or white matter (Fig. 3A). In
addition, inter-laminar astrocytes showed lower expression of
miRNAs -34a, -124a, -338, -320 and -449 compared to the
other 2 regions. Of these 5 latter miRNAs, the difference between inter-laminar astrocytes and astrocytes from the other
2 regions was more pronounced for miRNAs -34a, -124a and
-338 (Fig. 3B).
In contrast, miRNAs -125b, -143 and -146a were more
highly expressed in inter-laminar astrocytes than in astrocytes
from deep grey matter. Astrocytes from deeper grey matter
did not express miR-125b; however, miR-146a was the only
miRNA in our panel that was found to be more highly expressed in inter-laminar astrocytes compared to those from
both the deeper cortical layers and the white matter (Fig. 3C).

Comparison of miRNA Expression Between
Astrocytes From Adult Deep Grey and White
Matter
Significant differences were only observed for 3 miRNAs. MiR-181a was more highly expressed in deeper grey
matter astrocytes. MiR-125b was not detected in deeper grey
matter astrocytes (Fig. 3C), whereas miR-449 was more
highly expressed in white matter astrocytes (Fig. 3A, C).

Comparison of Astrocyte miRNA Expression
Between Adult and Fetal White Matter
Adult white matter captured cells showed higher expression of miRNAs -34a, -124a, -143, -145, -146a, -155, 320, -338 -365 and -449 compared to those from the fetal
white matter (Fig. 4). Of these miRNAs, the difference in expression of miR-449 was the most significant. Of the miRNAs examined, none were more highly expressed in fetal
white matter compared to adult white matter.

Comparison of Astrocyte miRNA Expression
Between Fetal White Matter and Germinal
Matrix
miRNAs -21, -124a, -145, -365 and -449 were less
highly expressed in astrocytes from the white matter compared to cells from the germinal matrix (Fig. 5). Again, of all

cells. (F) Fetal white matter astrocytes. The stained cells are smaller than in the adult, and have delicate processes. Radial GFAPpositive glial fibers are also seen traversing the white matter toward the cortex. Non-stained migrating cells are associated with the

of these miRNAs, the difference in expression of miR-449 was
most significant.

Comparison of miRNA Expression Between
Astrocytes in Adult Inter-Laminar Region and
Those in Fetal Germinal Matrix
miRNAs -129, -181a, -210, -214 and -365 were detected in germinal matrix astrocytes but not in inter-laminar
astrocytes (Fig. 6A). In addition, the astrocytes in the germinal matrix showed a higher expression of miRNAs -34a, -124a,
320 and -338 compared to adult inter-laminar astrocytes (Fig.
6B). In contrast, adult inter-laminar astrocytes had a higher expression of miRNAs -29a, -143, -146a and -155 compared to
germinal matrix astrocytes (Fig. 6C).

DISCUSSION
Our study is the first to demonstrate differences in miRNA
expression profiles of astrocytes specifically and individually
isolated by LCM from different regions of normal adult and fetal human brains. This approach circumvents limitations of studies analyzing miRNA expression from whole tissue samples
and in vitro studies. In whole tissue samples, the specific cell
type represents only part of the overall tissue composition. Two
previous reports have focused on the miRNA profiles of adult

human astrocytes. The first report detected miR-155 in astrocytes captured from multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions (16), and
the second was an in vitro study on miR-125b using commercially available frozen human astrocytes (17). In the present
study, we used GFAP immunoreactivity to define astrocytes in
situ using FFPE tissue sections from cases without specific recognizable pathologies to extract positively identified cells. The
stability of miRNAs permits efficient expression profiling even
from FFPE tissue samples (18, 19). A possible limitation of this
strategy could be that some astrocytes, particularly those under
non-activated conditions, may not have expressed detectable
levels of GFAP. Similar limitations also apply to other markers
such as aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 and glutamine synthetase.
In all of our mid-second trimester fetal samples, we detected and isolated GFAP-positive cells in developing white
matter (Fig. 1D, F) and germinal matrix (Fig. 1D, E); however, as expected, few GFAP-positive cells were identified in
developing grey matter (20, 21). In the human fetal brain, it
has been previously noted that GFAP-positive cells start appearing in the internal capsule and thalamus by 14 weeks, in
the ependyma of the frontal lobe by 14 to19 weeks, and in the
germinal matrix starting at 17 weeks (7, 22–24). Compared to
astrocytes in the adult samples, the cell bodies in the fetal
samples were significantly smaller in all regions, likely reflecting the requirements for increased mobility of astrocytes
during development.

In Situ miRNA Expression in Human Astrocytes

We based our selection of the 20 miRNAs used in this
study on their known functional role in astrocytes because they
were known to be enriched in astrocytes, or for their predicted
or proven roles in regulating inflammatory or neuroregenerative responses, which may play major roles in normal surveillance and in disease (Table). Many of the miRNAs showed little variation of expression from one area to another (Fig. 2A),
suggesting (as would be expected) that there are functions
common to all astrocytes. However, for those that showed significant regional variation (Fig. 7), we can infer some individual functional characteristics specific to the various regions.
Our studies have shown that the inter-laminar astrocytes
(Fig. 1A) appear to have a unique overall miRNA profile, in addition to their specialized morphologic features. In contrast to
astrocytes in the deeper cortical layers and in the white matter
of the adult, miRNAs -129, -181a, -210, -214 and -365 were
undetectable in the inter-laminar astrocytes. In addition, miRNAs -34a, -124a, -338, -320, and -449 were expressed significantly lower in the inter-laminar astrocytes than in the other 2
adult regions. As indicated in the Table, these miRNAs have
important roles in cell proliferation, development, migration,
and angiogenesis, as well as in both pro- and anti-inflammatory
processes. Overexpression of miR-34a under pharmacological
activation of SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1) in mouse neural stem cells promoted astrogliogenesis (25). The lower expression of miR-34a
in the inter-laminar layer could contribute to the stability of
these cells, which have lower proliferative properties than the
other regions. The inter-laminar cells have a lower expression
of miR-124a, which regulates EAAT2 (excitatory amino acid

transporter 2, rodent analog GLT1) protein (26). Glutamate
transporters are critical for homeostasis of neurons and axons;
and the low levels of miR-124a probably reflect the relative
paucity of neurons in this anatomic location. In agreement with
our results, miR-338 is reported to be less highly expressed in
grey matter than white matter; its function is thought to enhance
pro-inflammatory responses (Table) (27). The lower expression
of miR-320, a negative regulator of aquaporin-4 (28), may account for the very prominent staining of this protein in the glial
limitans (29). This would contribute to the observed increased
aquaporin expression in the cell processes of the glial limitans.
MiR-449 is essential for proper brain development (30), probably involving multiple cell processes such as proliferation and
migration by ensuring efficient microtubular function; reduced
expression of miR-449, a modulator of microtubule dynamics,
may contribute to the architecture of this region.
In contrast, miRNAs -125b, -143, and -146a were enriched
in inter-laminar astrocytes compared to those in the deeper
layers and white matter. MiR-125b has been previously described as a brain enriched miRNA (31), which is implicated in
astrogliosis based on in vitro studies (17). Inter-laminar astrocytes have enhanced expression of miR-125b, which is a modulator of GFAP expression. The increased expression of miR146a, an anti-inflammatory miRNA (32), coincides with reduced expression of the pro-inflammatory miRNAs -338 and
-365. The potential importance of this finding in explaining the
lower level of inflammation in the grey matter of MS patients is
noted below. MiR-143 acts as a tumor suppressor in glioma
cells (33). Our data overall suggest that the inter-laminar cells

represent a more stable population of astrocytes, with less capacity for cell proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis, and very
little role in neuron-axon metabolic homeostasis In addition to
other functions that these cells may have, miRNA expression results suggest that they act as a first-line of defense against substances or agents entering the CNS from the cerebrospinal fluid.

Astrocytes in the deep cortical layers and the white matter
showed similar expression of numerous miRNAs, suggesting
that their functions, in spite of the anatomic differences, were
also similar (Fig. 3). However, there are some differences
between the 2 regions. miR-181a was more highly expressed
in deeper grey matter astrocytes compared to those from white

J Neuropathol Exp Neurol  Volume 75, Number 2, February 2016

matter. This may be of significance in helping to understand the
relatively lesser extent of inflammatory activity of grey matter
lesions in MS compared with those of the white matter (34). In
contrast to our findings using laser-captured astrocytes, miR181a was upregulated in the white matter in a study that used
whole tissue samples (27). Such results may be attributed to the
expression of this miRNA in cells other than astrocytes, including oligodendrocytes or neurons at the grey and white matter
border. MiR-125b remained undetected in deeper grey matter
astrocytes, whereas white matter astrocytes expressed this
miRNA. Similarly, deeper grey matter astrocytes had lower expression of miR-449 compared to white matter astrocytes. As
discussed above, both miRNAs -125b (17) and -449 (30) are
relevant in the context of structural functions in astrocytes.
Higher expression of these miRNAs in white matter astrocytes
may perhaps be an indication of more pronounced structural requirements/demands of this region.
We found that miRNAs -146a, -155, -365, -338, -145,
-124a, -320, -143, -34a and -449 were more highly expressed
in adult white matter astrocytes compared to fetal astrocytes
(Fig. 4). The functional roles of miR-146a (anti-inflammatory)
and miR-155 (pro-inflammatory) have been previously characterized in astrocytes in vitro. MiR-146a is an inflammationresolving miRNA and targets IRAK-1 (interleukin-1 receptorassociated kinase-1) mRNA (32); miR-155 is a pro-inflammatory molecule that targets SOCS-1 (suppressor of cytokine signaling-1) mRNA (35). MiR-365 is a key inflammation mediator that directly targets mouse IL-6 mRNA and represses the
expression of IL-6 protein in microglia (36). MiR-338 is expressed in astrocytes, is upregulated in MS patient tissue and
CNS tissue of animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and has been postulated to be pro-inflammatory (37). The low expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory
miRNAs in the fetal white matter may explain the poor response
of the white matter to injury seen in fetal brains (5). In rodent
spinal cord astrocyte cultures, overexpression of miR-145 has
been shown to be a negative regulator of astrocytic size, morphology, and migratory behaviors (38). Lower expression of
miR-145 in fetal white matter astrocytes may contribute to increased migratory abilities of these cells during development.
MiR-124, the regulator of GLT1 protein (26), plays an important role in tissue homeostasis, as described above (Table). The
low levels of expression of miR-124 in micro-dissected fetal astrocytes is consistent with reports that GLT1 is not detectable in
human fetal astrocyte cultures (39) but is detected in human
adult brain-derived astrocytes in culture (40). The functional relevance of miRNAs -320, -143, -34a and -449 has been described above and in the Table. No miRNAs were found to be
more highly expressed in the fetal white matter than in the adult
white matter. This finding is perhaps not unexpected in that the
astrocytes in the fetal white matter are migrating and have not
yet established fixed anatomical and functional relationships
with the axons, neurons, blood vessels or the sub-pial brain
tissue.
Compared to astrocytes in the fetal white matter, a number of miRNAs were upregulated in the fetal germinal matrix,
including miRNAs -21, -145, -124a, -365 and -449 (Fig. 5). In
contrast to the fetal white matter, which contains large numbers
of migrating astrocytes, the germinal matrix is a highly active

tissue with proliferating and differentiating cells, leading to gliogenesis and neurogenesis (41). We speculate that these miRNAs
may also participate in the reaction that occurs in this region in
response to systemic infection in premature infants (42). MiR21 has been associated with properties related to astrocytic scarring in vitro (43); this is a structural function. The early development of GFAP-positive radial glial astrocytes provides scaffolding for migration of other cell types (5). There is, however,
a cell culture-based study using rodent astrocytes that showed
that miR-21 negatively regulates GFAP expression and cell
size (44). The functional findings of increased miR-145 are contradictory. Although migration in the white matter could be
explained by lower levels, the decrease in proliferation in the
germinal matrix is puzzling (Table). At present, we have no explanation for this but future studies may provide clarification.
The functional relevance of miRNAs -124a, -365 and -449 have
been described above and are also noted in the Table. All of
these miRNAs would be required for the successful proliferative
and protective properties of a highly active developing area.
The cellular modalities underlying inflammation and development are often common to both.
We also compared the miRNA profiles of the adult interlaminar astrocytes with those of fetal germinal matrix layer
astrocytes since both these cells form radial glial fibers and
provide structural support. The inter-laminar cells provide processes subtending the glial limitans and confer some rigidity,
whereas the radial processes of the germinal matrix astrocyte
provide structural support for cell migration. miRNAs 129, 181a, -210, -214 and -365 were only detected in the germinal
matrix astrocytes. The expression of miRNAs -129, -210 and 214 in the germinal matrix is not unexpected because they have
anti-apoptotic and neurogenic/proliferative functions (Table).
miRNAs -181a and -365 are anti- and pro-inflammatory, respectively, and have been discussed above. miRNAs -34a, -124a, 320 and -338 were detected with lower expression in cells from
the inter-laminar region compared to the fetal germinal matrix.
Higher expression of these miRNAs in the germinal matrix
confirms the dynamic nature of this region (Table). miRNAs
-29a, -143, -146a and -155 all had higher expression in interlaminar astrocytes than the germinal matrix. miR-29a has a cell
protective function demonstrated in vitro (45). There is no obvious reason why this miRNA should be more highly expressed
in the inter-laminar cells than those in the germinal matrix. The
anti-proliferative function of miR-143 can be related to the stable nature of inter-laminar astrocytes; miRNAs -146a and -155
are inflammation-related (Table).
The results of PCA and hierarchical clustering analyses
show an overall pattern of similarity between the multiple dynamic functional activities of the astrocytes in the deeper cortex,
the white matter, and the fetal germinal matrix. In contrast, the
astrocytes from the inter-laminar layer and the fetal white matter, although differing greatly from each other, appear to have
more restricted functional roles (Fig. 2B, D). The PCA was performed using 2 different statistical analysis tools: the NIA array
R
tool (Fig. 2B, D) and with JMPV
software (data not shown); we
obtained the same results from these analyses using 2 different
tools.
Overall, the present study suggests a wide variation of
miRNAs governing the functional properties of astrocytes, which

are dependent to a large degree on age and anatomical location
(Fig. 7). Increasing insights into the astrocytic functions of distinct miRNAs will provide a greater opportunity to determine
their roles in disease, as well as to devise therapeutic agents to
target and alter pathological processes.
