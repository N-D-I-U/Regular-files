miR-132 is an endogenous small RNA and controls post-transcriptional regulation of
gene expression via controlled degradation of mRNA or transcription inhibition. In the
nervous system, miR-132 is significant for regulating neuronal differentiation, maturation
and functioning, and widely participates in axon growth, neural migration, and plasticity.
The miR-132 is affected by factors like mRNA expression, functional redundancy, and
signaling cascades. It targets multiple downstream molecules to influence physiological
and pathological neuronal activities. MiR-132 can influence the pathogenesis of many
diseases, especially in the nervous system. The dysregulation of miR-132 results in
the occurrence and exacerbation of neural developmental, degenerative diseases, like
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy, neural infection and psychiatric
disorders including disturbance of consciousness, cognition and memory, depression
and schizophrenia. Regulation of miR-132 expression relieves symptoms, alleviates
severity and finally effects a cure. This review aims to discuss the clinical potentials
of miR-132 in the nervous system.

INTRODUCTION
MicroRNA (miRNA) is an endogenic RNA composed of 20 to 24 nucleotides, in combination
with the 30 untranslated region (30 UTR) to regulate the expression of gene transcription (Reschke
and Henshall, 2015). Currently, around 1500 genes encoded by miRNAs have been confirmed in
the human genome, regulating the expression of various mRNAs in different physiological and
biological conditions. Among these miRNAs, miR-132 has been mentioned in many articles that
illustrate its role in the neuronal development and functioning. Besides, its part in diverse diseases
of the nervous system has not been elucidated clearly yet. miR-132 was initially found in nerve
tissues of mice (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2001), later in human (Calin et al., 2004), zebrafish (Chen
et al., 2005), and cow (Coutinho et al., 2007). Mature miR-132 sequences with a length of 22 base
pairs (bp) are processed by precursor sequences with 66 bp in length (Coutinho et al., 2007).
miR-132 in the human body is composed of two homologous miRNAs, hsa-miR-132-5p and hsamiR-132-3p. The latter miRNA is a significant part of the miR-132/212 cluster, targets and decreases
spinal AMPA receptor subunit GluA1 as a negative regulator of chronic neuropathic pain (Leinders
et al., 2016). miR-132 has undergone conservative evolution in humans, rats, mice, apes, and other
species, exhibiting the same sequence and structure (Sun et al., 2015).
Regulation of miR-132 in a biological process is critical to physiological balance among various
systems in human bodies. It is influenced by several factors including expression levels of miR-132

differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into dopamine
neurons. In the mouse ESCs, Yang and colleagues noticed that
endogenous miR-132 expression was directly down-regulated
by the antisense oligonucleotide, thereby promoting the cell
differentiation of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive nerve cells.
Furthermore, the antisense oligonucleotide is even capable of
reversing the neuronal differentiation of the miR-132-mediated
inhibitory effect (Yang D. et al., 2012). Besides, Yoshimura and
colleagues pointed out that silencing miR-132 or suppressing
ERK1/2 signaling pathway activation led to the increased
expression of a variety of synaptic proteins, including PSD-95,
GluR1 and synapsin I (Yoshimura et al., 2016). Therefore,
miR-132 can be regarded as a negative regulator of synapse
maturation and cell differentiation.

and its mRNA target, overlapping functional redundancy,
temporal patterns of miR-132 changes, signaling feedbacks and
other control mechanisms, as well as miR-132 longevity with
long-lasting effects on protein output (Ebert and Sharp, 2012).
Once the balance is broken, dysregulation of miR-132 will lead to
occurrence and exacerbation of multiple disorders from different
systems, including the nervous system.
miR-132 represents a broad category of nerve regulatory
networks in the dynamic regulation of neuronal differentiation,
maturation and functioning, and participates in axon growth,
neural migration, and plasticity. The dysfunction of miR-132
occurs widely in neural development, neurodegenerative diseases
and psychological and mental disorders (Table 1). Regulation
of miR-132 expression and downstream signaling cascades
potentially relieves symptoms, alleviates severity and finally
effects a cure.

Neural Plasticity
Apart from cell proliferation and differentiation, miR-132 is also
implicated in the process of modulation of specific neuronal
and immune function. Remenyi and colleagues found that in
miR-132/212 knockout mouse models, miR-132 could affect
cortex synaptic transmission and plasticity (Remenyi et al., 2013).
Developing axons can localize protein synthesis. In the axon,
miR-132 is present at high concentrations and regulates axonal
growth through the target gene Rasa1. Hancock and colleagues
proposed two possible mechanisms for the regulation of the
activity of miR-132: potential axonal guidance and the temporal
regulation associated with the developmental stage (Hancock
et al., 2014). Another mechanism for regulation of miR-132
is raised by Cheng and colleagues. They believe that miR-132
attenuates the entraining effects of light, induced by photic
stimulation via a MAPK/CREB signaling pathway (Cheng et al.,
2007).
Apart from miR-132 knock out, silencing other molecules
can also contribute to negative regulation of neural plasticity
together with miR-132. Luteolin, a type of flavonoid, acts as
a nerve nutrition factor. By knocking out luteolin, Lin and
colleagues demonstrated that the inhibition of axon growth with
the combined effect of miR-132 and luteolin, suggesting miR-132
might regulate nerve axon formation. They think that luteolin
can activate the cAMP response element binding protein via
phosphorylation to improve the miR-132 expression level and
axon growth. According to the findings, luteolin therapy can
enhance the level of ERK phosphorylation and PKA activity by
inducing miR-132 expression and promoting axonal growth (Lin
et al., 2012). Based on the researches above, we conclude the main
roles of miR-132 in neurological conditions (Figure 1).

PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF
miR-132 IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM
Neural Growth and Migration
The physiological involvement of miR-132 in the process of
neural growth and migration requires multiple interactions with
other cells. Radial glial progenitors, regulated by the Notch
signaling pathway, have significant implications in the neural
growth and patterning of spinal cord. Salta and colleagues
identified a bidirectional regulatory circuit in a temporal
manner between miR-132 and its target Ctbp2 (C-terminal
binding protein 2). This circuit dynamically contributes to the
transduction of Notch signaling and its downstream effects on
glial progenitors. During early stage of embryogenesis, increasing
Ctbp2 represses transcriptional level of Sirtuin-1 to initiate Notch
signaling cascade, resulting in the progressive accumulation of
the glial progenitor cells. With significant increase of Ctbp2,
miR-132 expression becomes much higher and suppresses
Ctbp2 expression after reaching a certain threshold. These
processes contribute to a bidirectional Notch signaling pathway
in Gfap+ glial progenitors (Salta et al., 2014). Moreover, block of
miR132-mediated repression contributed to the overexpression
of MeCP2 and BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) levels
in vivo (Klein et al., 2007).
Besides, miR-132 impacts on the neural migration in
mammals. By profiling gene expression and knocking out
miR-132 in the mice dorsal root ganglion, Clovis and colleagues
identified the ectopic expression of a new form of transcription
factor Foxp2 in cortex projecting neurons. Therefore, the group
believes knocking out miR-132 leads to a reduction of Foxp2
expression, a delay of neurite outgrowth and blockage of radial
migration for neural cells. Moreover, proliferation and branching
is precisely regulated by a coordinated effort of miR-9 and
miR-132 for Foxp2 derived 30 UTR (Clovis et al., 2012).

inflammation, and a series of immune reactions. Sirtuin-1
possibly inhibits the transcription factors NF-kB and AP-1 in
BCR signaling pathways, thus inhibiting the downstream LT
and TNF-α expression. Excitation of Sirtuin-1 is regulated by
resveratrol, a small molecule that can pass the blood brain
barrier and suppress pro-inflammatory cellular responses in
the peripheral circulation and target organs (Nakahama et al.,
2013). Yeung and colleagues also proposed that Sirtuin-1 could
reduce nerve damage and regulate nerve protection in muscle
atrophy sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease (Yeung et al., 2004).
Sirtuin-1 down-regulates miR-132 expression and regulates
downstream targets, offering a meaningful alternative therapy in
MS treatment.

involving mental, physical, and sometimes psychiatric problems
(Compston and Coles, 2002). Miyazaki and colleagues found a
significant rise in miR-132 expression in B cells accompanied
with the disease onset. Compared with the healthy group, dual
B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)+CD40 stimulation considerably
increased the expression of lymphotoxin (LT) and TNF-α, along
with a significant increase in miR-132 (p = 0.0143). MiR-132 does
not directly target LT and TNF-α, indicating an indirect pathway.
(Miyazaki et al., 2014; Table 1).
Nakahama and colleagues used Sirtuin-1, a negative regulator
of miR-132 to study the underlying mechanism. Sirtuin-1,
member of the histone acetylation enzyme III family, plays
an important role in aging, metabolism, tumor formation,

Advances in Roles of miR-132 in the Nervous System

FIGURE 1 | Major physiological functions of miR-132 in the nervous system. The physiological involvement of miR-132 in the process of neural growth and
migration, cell differentiation and neural plasticity and major regulator genes in the process are listed above.

Alzheimer’s Disease

dysregulated at early courses of the disease, especially before
neuronal loss occurs. Therefore, miR-132 is closely related to
LOAD in different stages (Magill et al., 2010). miR-132 with a
high synaptic activity and plasticity, regulates neural outgrowth
under the effect of nerve growth factors. Moreover, it controls
the combination of newborn neurons in adult hypothalamus
and dentate gyrus, and shapes synapse formation and plasticity
in the visual cortex. miR-132 has many molecular targets, such
as Tau, EP300, Sirtuin-1 and FOXO1a (Min et al., 2010). In
the AD samples of the hypothalamus, the protein content of
FOXO1a obviously increased (Lau et al., 2013). By examining the
expression of different downstream targets of miR-132, we are
provided with a new way to predict disease progression.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a
progressive development style and one of the most common types
of dementia. In 30 years, it is predicted that there will be over
100 million AD patients. The synapses and neurons are lost at a
significant rate in the basal forebrain, cortex and hippocampus in
these patients, resulting in cognitive decline and other symptoms.
The abnormal expression of miRNA regulates major AD-related
genes, such as APP and BACE1, affects Aβ cytotoxicity and neural
death, and even marks characteristic changes in disease initiation
and progression (Fang et al., 2012). Wong and colleagues found
that the decrease of miR-132/212 could be detected at the
onset of AD, and it became especially distinct at the late stage.
In primary cultured neurons, the inhibition of miR-132/212
expression will lead to TUNEL-positive neuron accumulation
and caspase-dependent apoptosis. They prove that PTEN and
FOXO3a are two direct targets and suppress the AKT signaling
pathway (Wong et al., 2013; Table 1). The inhibition of either
miR-132 or miR-212 will eliminate the inhibition of PTEN and
FOXO3a and trigger programmed death.
Similarly, the miR-132/212 cluster in late-onset Alzheimer’s
disease (LOAD) appears to be in significant decline. miR-132-3p
exhibits different levels of decreased expression in three different
parts – the hypothalamus, the frontal cortex and medial temporal
area (Luikart et al., 2011). Through the analysis of the LOAD
samples from the hypothalamus, expression levels are found
to be promoted in glial-rich miR-142-3p, miR-150-5p and
miR-223-3p. However, these miRNAs can only be detected in
the middle-late stage, so they only explain the loss of neurons
of neurodegenerative diseases in late stages. miR-132-3p is

Parkinson’s Disease
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is closely associated with age and
the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after
Alzheimer’s disease. It attacks 1–2% people aged 60 and
above (Yoshimura et al., 2016). The neurodegenerative process
in PD affects the midbrain dopamine projections from the
substantia nigra with the disruption of dopamine transmission
in the motor loop of the basal ganglia. Lungu and colleagues
developed a spontaneous autosomal recessive rat model for
neurodegeneration and found a decreased expression of BDNF in
the midbrain and plasma. Increased synaptic nucleoprotein α and
decreased Nurr1 transcription factor lead to a significant increase
in the miR-132 level (Lungu et al., 2013; Table 1). Decressac
and colleagues showed the downstream target of miR-132, Nurr1
nucleoprotein, has an anti- toxic effect on nucleoprotein α
(Decressac et al., 2012; Table 1). Therefore, Nurr1 is the most

miR-132 on the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway as an important
mechanism of epilepsy (Xiang et al., 2015).

Tauopathies: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy

Neural Infection
Virus and Prion Infection

Tauopathies account for a major group of neurological and
movement diseases with a significant characteristics that its
main cause, protein tau exhibits abnormal deposits in the
cells. The miRNA expression information from patients who
had progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a primary 4R-tau
disorder was comprehensively analyzed, which displayed a
downregulation of miR-132. Moreover, miR-132 can target
polypyrimidine tract binding protein 2 (PTBP2) directly, which
is a major neuronal splicing factor and increased in protein level
from PSP patients. Overexpressed miR-132 or silenced PTBP2
can influence endogenous 4R:3R-tau proportion in neurons
(Smith et al., 2011; Table 1).

Varicella, also called chickenpox, is a highly contagious disease
caused by varicella zoster virus (VZV). As novel and non-invasive
indicators for the diagnosis of contagious disease, circulating
miRNAs have been intensively researched. Qi and colleagues
found that miR-132 could distinguish varicella patients from
healthy controls and other microbial infections with moderate
sensitivity and specificity (Qi et al., 2014; Table 1).
Prion disease, a kind of deadly disease can cause
neurodegeneration and affect mammals. The underlying
pathogenesis is probably that normal cellular prion protein,
(PrPC) is turned into the infectious type, PrPSc (Scrapie prion
protein). Although this happens over a long preclinical latency
stage, compromised nerve function is noticed at asymptomatic
stages. Particularly, in animal models of prion disease, loss of
synaptic function occurs before the onset of clinical symptoms.
Majer and colleagues separated hippocampal CA1 neurons,
determined the preclinical transcriptional response, and found
the abnormal transcription of miR-132-3p blocked synaptic
N-methyl-D-aspartate (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid, NMDA)
receptor signaling pathways to suppress the protection function
(Majer et al., 2012; Table 1). miR-132 plays an indirect role in the
pathogenesis of prion disease and target management of miR-132
seems to be a promising method for prevention.

Epilepsy
Epilepsy is a chronically progressive neurological disease
originating from unusual neuronal discharges in the brain.
There are nearly 50 million epileptic patients in the world,
which puts heavy burden on societies. The present antiepileptic therapy aims at inhibiting convulsant or epileptic
effects. They can control the frequency of seizure attacks,
but attempts on revealing the underlying pathophysiology of
epilepsy show little progress. Nudelman and colleagues found
that pilocarpine induced epilepsy led to a significant upregulation
of primiR-132 and mature miR-132. miR-132 in patients with
epilepsy tolerance presents a significant ability to react to different
stimuli (Nudelman et al., 2010). Studies on the functional
sequence of miR-132 showed that before status epilepticus occurs,
miR-132 antagomirs, which can inhibit expression of miR-132,
does not reduce epilepsy risks but can significantly reduce the
hippocampal nerve damage, which confirms that the excessive
expression of miR-132 aggravates neuronal damage after status
epilepticus attacks (Peng et al., 2013; Table 1). Researchers also
found that levels of miR-132 in the acute and chronic phases
were significantly increased. In the latency stage, the expression
of miR-132 was still at a high level (Jimenez-Mateos et al.,
2011; Table 1). Moreover, micro-injection of the antagomirs can
significantly decrease miR-132 and reduce mortality caused by
the abnormal epileptic discharge of neurons. The increase of
miR-132 in the latency stage of epilepsy provides new insight into
the prediction and control of the disease.
The role of miR-132 in the pathogenesis of epilepsy also
involves the participation of other genes and factors. In a focal
medial temporal lobe epilepsy model, the 30 UTR binding sites
of the transcription factor SOX11 were found to be connected
with miR-132-3p to regulate the branching and bifurcation
of newborn neurons. Using a status epilepticus hippocampus
neuron model, Lei and colleagues found that miR-132 and BDNF
mRNA increased significantly. Meanwhile changes in epileptic
discharge were noticed as well. BDNF preprocessing catabatic
TrkB receptor activation can partially reduce high frequency
discharge, but the excessive expression of miR-132 deteriorates
the symptoms of epileptic discharge, proving the control of

Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org

Parasite Infection
Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a highly infectious parasite
to living creatures. It is discovered that T. gondii impacts
intermediate hosts on their behavioral changes as long as it
progresses to a late stage, distinguished by the parasite cysts
existing in the brain. Li and colleagues found that miR-132,
was the only miRNA that was apparently increased in all three
prototype Toxoplasma strains. They predicted the potential target
and identified 20 genes and the strongest associated pathway
dopamine receptor signaling cascade (Li et al., 2015; Table 1).
In chronically infected mice models, it was discovered that
miR-132 overexpression upregulated nerve spine density in
transgenic mice at the cost of recognition and memory functions
(Xiao et al., 2014; Table 1). Wang and colleagues reported that
when the expression of miR-132 was decreased in hippocampus,
their ability for tracing fear memory was compromised at
the same time. Therefore, in Toxoplasma gondii infection, the
memory of infected patients will be impaired whether miR132 is increased or decreased. The detection of five brain
regions showed that women were infected in the hypothalamus,
hippocampus, striatum and brainstem. However, men were
infected only in the hippocampus. This confirms that sex is an
important factor in the severity of disease (Hansen et al., 2010;
Table 1). In spite of the regulatory ability of BDNF for miR-132
in neurons, it is not correlated in the brains of individuals with
Toxoplasma infection. Wanet and colleagues found that other
transcription factors, such as CREB and REST, may affect the

compared with in vitro results. The reduced expression of
miR-132 and Rac1 led to up-regulation in hippocampal cofilin
which contributes to correct learning and memory for its
necessity of correct spine and synapse morphology (Kempf
et al., 2014; Table 1). This process is essential for the correct
development of the synaptic morphological structure of dendritic
spines to ensure proper memory and cognitive function.

expression level of miR-132 in patients with chronic infection
(Wanet et al., 2012).

Psychological Diseases
Disturbance of Consciousness and Cognition
Apart from the involvement in the neurologic diseases, miR-132
also deeply affects the psychological changes and formation of
mental problems. In three different stress rat models, Shaltiel
and colleagues found long-term stress can significantly improve
the individual differences and expression levels of hippocampus
miR-132. At the same time, the expression for two miR-132
targets AChE and GTP enzyme agonist p250GAP is restrained
(Shaltiel et al., 2013). In a foot shock model, knocking out
AChE significantly restricted the increase of miR-132. The
results confirmed that the hippocampus miR-132 mediated the
sustainability of the cholinergic signaling pathway, which was
interrupted by AChE overexpression (Shaltiel et al., 2013). The
inhibition of AChE will hinder cognitive defects stimulated by the
plantar electric shocks, which indicates that miR-132 regulates
the process of cognitive impairment after stress (Wayman et al.,
2008). Under the AChE glucocorticoid reactive component
activation, the ACh level drops and suppresses the CREB-induced
transcription for miR-132, later achieving balance again (Vo
et al., 2005). The inhibition of cortical neuron p250GAP will
improve axial budding and neuronal activity, the GABAα
inhibitor dicentrine can induce miR-132 transcription and reduce
p250GAP expression levels to further promote axonal growth
(Impey et al., 2010). These findings confirm the long-term
double inhibition of AChE and p250GAP will balance excessive
axonal budding-related nerve damages and become an important
compensatory mechanism.
Hansen and colleagues showed miR-132 expression was
upregulated prominently via a spatial memory mission by 1.5
folds, in excitatory hippocamal layers confirming the positive role
of miR-132 in cognitive capacity (Hansen et al., 2013; Table 1).

Depression
Depression has become an increasingly prevalent health
problem throughout the world. Yi and colleagues found
that single anti-depression therapy has a poor effect in 30%
of depression patients. miR-132 can improve nerve growth,
synaptic function, and cognition and offers several antidepressant
effects (Yi et al., 2014; Table 1). Natural Extracts compose of
a major part in depression treatment. Oleanolic acid is a
pentacyclic terpene that can secrete serotonin and inhibit
ischemic brain damage (Yang Y.C. et al., 2012). BDNF and TrkB
are closely related to neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic
signals and participate in the antidepressant response of
oleanolic acid. Researchers silenced miR-132 expression to
inhibit oleanolic acid-mediated behavior improvement and
nerve nutritional signal transduction pathways. Oleanolic
acid regulates and inhibits the signal transduction pathway
and neuron proliferation of chronic stress injury through
hypothalamus TrkB receptor-mediated BDNF-ERK after CREB
miR-132 (Luikart et al., 2011; Table 1). Previous studies have
reported that BDNF can increase cortical cultivation and miR132 expression levels of dopamine neurons (Numakawa et al.,
2011a,b), which proves a great potential in antidepressant
treatment.

Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is comprised of affective, cognitive,
neuromorphological, and molecular abnormalities that originate
from a problematic neurodevelopment. Accurate diagnosis
of this disease seems to be a priority for early control and
management. Yu and colleagues used dizocilpine to create a
schizophrenia-like rat model and found that decrease of miR-132
in peripheral blood of 105 schizophrenia controls compared
to 130 healthy controls. Besides, they also proved an apparent
increase of miR-132 after risperidone treatment compared to
that before treatment, further indicating the diagnostic role for
miR-132 in schizophrenia (Yu et al., 2015).
As for the primary mechanism for schizophrenia onset, the
dysregulation through NMDA/AMPA receptor-related signaling
pathway may potentially disrupt cognitive development. Miller
and colleagues found that miR-132 contributed to activityoriented synaptic plasticity via NMDARs’ involvement in the
positive feedback loop. A four-fold upregulation was noticed in
miR-132 expression in the prefrontal cortex(PFC) in 3 weeks,
after birth, a period with large quantity of synaptic modulation,
via NMDAR signaling. Decreased miR-132 expression and the
abnormal expression of Dpysl3 could affect synaptic activity
and outgrowth negatively (Miller et al., 2012; Table 1). The
above conclusions indicated that miR-132 was significant for gene
expression mode in the PFC neurodevelopment.

Memory Disturbance
Hippocampal miR-132 is vital to the formation of trace
fear memory. Mature miR-132 was up-regulated and reached
a peak expression in 30 min with trace fear conditioning
(TFC) and returned to a normal value after 2 h. The above
information demonstrated the transient, expression of miR-132
was induced by activity (Lambert et al., 2010). The increased
level of hippocampus miR-132 assists in memory regulation
in dendritic spines and synaptic transmission. However, the
excessive expression of miR-132 in transgenic mice, can increase
the dendritic spine density but significantly damage the cognition
of spatial memory (Wang et al., 2013). This indicates that proper
miR-132 expression promotes good memory formation, and
the lack or overexpression of miR-132 will damage cognitive
function.
Besides, stimuli like high-dose ionizing radiation lead to
severe learning and memory impairments. Kempf and colleagues
observed radiation-induced reduction of Rac1 and miR-132
inhibits the GTPase-activating protein p250GAP to regulate
Rac1 activity. In the irradiated hippocampus and cortex, the
researchers observed similar changes in the signaling cascades

Advances in Roles of miR-132 in the Nervous System

therapeutic and diagnostic applications lie in its accuracy to
track down signaling transduction in a series of neurological
disorders and in its ability to multi-directionally regulate message
feedback circuits. Moreover, its significance also enlightens us
to improve drug development of target therapy, with the help
of miRNA mimics and miRNA antagonists that function as
regulators of important communication cascades. For now, the
mechanism of miR-132’s regulation of downstream targets is not
completely understood because the present research is limited
by brain blood barrier and thus it is difficult to study miR-132
in nanomedicine transport in brain diseases. To overcome
this problem, we need to further our investigation in the
future.
Limited research has been carried out on the miR-132
physiological functions related to peripheral nervous system
disorders. Yao and colleagues found miR-132 expression
increased after hypoxia dependent sciatic nerve injury. The
overexpression of miR-132 in Schwann cells significantly
promoted cell migration, and the injection of a miR-132 agonist
into a sciatic nerve lesion in mouse models accelerated the
migration of the distal Schwann cells proximally (Yao et al., 2016).
However, the molecular mechanism and the main signaling
pathways have not been fully elucidated. miR-132 is an important
neural-related miRNA, which promotes nerve growth, migration
and differentiation in the central nervous system and peripheral
nervous system. Without the intervention of the blood brain
barrier, miR-132 is directly involved in the various complex
physiological phenomena that regulate the progress of peripheral
neuropathy through similar feedback as is in the hippocampus
and thalamus. As an outrageously important neural-related
indicator, miR-132 significantly contributes to the control of
the neural network. It provides new opportunities for clinical
diagnosis and treatment of central and peripheral nervous
system diseases. Ongoing research is destined to transform
our understanding of disease mechanism and future treatment
clinically. Identifying new factors associated with the inhibition
of nerve regeneration and providing more molecular targets for
intervention will have a profound effect on miRNA research in
the future.

The maturation of prefrontal GABAergic interneurons, which
aim at excitatory nerve cells, is the second major process
during late neuron development. With the possible functions of
miR-132 in the initiation of NMDAR cascade taken into account,
dysregulated miR-132 expression may interrupt the maturation
of GABA interneurons at a molecular level where decreased
GAD67 was encoded by GAD1 gene and synthesized by GABA
(Balu et al., 2013; Table 1).

INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
miR-132 AND miR-212 IN THE NERVOUS
SYSTEM
miR-212, categorized to the same cluster as miR-132, also serves
as a significant gene in the process of neuronal development in
both physiological and pathological conditions. Close sequences
and identical seeding region are noticed in miR-132 and
miR-212, indicating their potential targeting the same mRNAs.
When it comes to the role in neurologic diseases, a downregulation of miR-212 is detected in anencephaly (Zhang et al.,
2010). Besides, in the prefrontal cortex of individuals, the
dysfunction of miR-132 and miR-212 is greatly influenced by
psychological diseases (Kim et al., 2010). Moreover, downregulation is detected in miR-132 and miR-212expression
in the α-synuclein overexpressed tissue, which is a classic
stereotype of PD (Gillardon et al., 2008). The interrelationship
between miR-132 and miR-212 deserves further investigation
and attention as to their promising roles in the physiological
and pathological regulation and functioning in the nervous
system.

DISCUSSION
Recently, microRNA (miR) modulators in neuronal processes
convey diagnostic and therapeutic implications for regulating
miR levels in many neurological diseases (Glass et al.,
2010). As one of the most significant neural-related miRNAs,
miR-132 mainly targets transcription factors and directly
or indirectly affects neural signaling to the central and
peripheral nervous systems. From the bidirectional regulatory
circuit between miR-132 and Ctbp2 in neural migration, to
cAMP/PKA- and ERK dependent CREB signaling cascade in
neural modification, changing miR-132 expression manipulates
neural signaling transduction and results in physiological
activities. Moreover, miR-132 is considered to play a significant
role in neural diseases, including caspase-dependent apoptosis,
synaptic signaling blockage and excessive axonal damages, and to
activate or inhibit downstream cascades, resulting in irreversible
devastation in humans. Its upregulation or downregulation in
some nerve tissues significantly affects normal neuron functions
and activity. Besides, at different stages of neural diseases,
the dysregulation of miR-132 could be regulated to different
directions under many transcriptional factors. Therefore, miRNA
target therapy and diagnosis pose a significant implication
in various situations. The major advantages of miR-132 in
