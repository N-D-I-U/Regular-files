Preface
Rapid evolutions in vector technologies and identification of key molecular targets have
facilitated the use of gene therapy as a vital approach for treating cardiovascular diseases. In
the past decade, there has been substantial progress in clinical translation of cardiac gene
therapy. Nevertheless, recent early clinical trials using gene therapy as a therapeutic approach
to improve heart failure have shown neutral results, and the difficulty of transferring the
genes to human hearts has become ever more recognized. Efficient, cardiac-specific, and
safe vectors, as well as refined vector delivery methods, are key for successful cardiac gene
transfer and eventually for improving patients’ outcomes. Newer vectors and more efficient
vector delivery methods have the potential to dramatically improve gene transduction efficacy, while novel gene manipulation techniques enforce the therapeutic power and broaden
disease targets.
The aim of this book is to provide methodological information on cardiac gene delivery
from classic to state-of-the-art technologies and techniques. Detailed and practical protocols described in this volume will be valuable tools for molecular biologists and physiologists in the cardiology field to conduct cardiac gene transfer research, which will ultimately
lead to further advancements in the field.
I thank all expert authors for their dedication in describing step-by-step methodologies
that will undoubtedly lead to successful cardiac gene therapy. I am very grateful to
Dr. Roger J. Hajjar (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) for assisting me with the
organization of the contents and also for contributing a number of chapters himself. Lastly,
I would like to thank John M. Walker, the series editor, who provided me with this opportunity and guiding the volume’s preparation process. We hope that the readers find Cardiac
Gene Therapy: Methods and Protocols to be a useful reference for conducting and improving
their projects.

Abstract
During the last decade, there has been a significant progress toward clinical translation in the field of cardiac gene therapy based on extensive preclinical data. However, despite encouraging positive results in
early phase clinical trials, more recent larger trials reported only neutral results. Nevertheless, the field has
gained important knowledge from these trials and is leading to the development of more cardiotropic vectors and improved delivery systems. It has become more evident that humans are more resistant to therapeutic transgene expression compared to experimental animals and thus refinement in gene delivery tools
and methods are essential for future success. We provide an overview of the current status of cardiac gene
therapy focusing on gene delivery tools and methods. Newer technologies, devices, and approaches will
undoubtedly lead to more promising clinical results in the near future.

Introduction
From the time I wrote a chapter in this book series in 2003 describing the cardiac gene transfer methods in rodents [1], there has
been tremendous progress in the cardiac gene therapy field towards
clinical translation. After an early disappointment from the neutral
phase II–III angiogenic gene therapy trials using plasmid DNA
and adenoviral vectors [2], the field has quickly shifted to more
efficient vectors and delivery methods to improve gene transfer
efficacy. Application of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)
for cardiac gene delivery is a representative technological advance
that enables long-term, efficient, and homogeneous cardiac gene
transduction. Numbers of preclinical studies have demonstrated
efficient transgene expression and therapeutic efficacy using this
vector [3, 4] which led to the initiation of early phase clinical trials
[5]. However, after much promise in these early phase trials [5–7],
a more recent larger trial reported only neutral results [8]. Similarly,
another phase II clinical gene therapy trial utilizing transcatheter

endocardial injection of plasmid DNA failed to meet the primary
efficacy endpoint [9]. These results will delay the application of
cardiac gene therapy in daily clinical practice; however, we have
gained important knowledge to move forward. Cardiac samples
obtained from patients who underwent cardiac transplantation
after the rAAV gene therapy has informed us that the vectors
indeed transduce the human heart [6]. Notwithstanding, the viral
uptake within the myocardium was much lower in humans compared to animal studies which only corresponds to less than 1 % of
cardiomyocytes being infected [10]. These results direct us to
refine our methods of cardiac gene transfer including a search for
better vectors, more robust delivery systems and novel targets.
This book has a timely focus on these methodologies to further
improve cardiac gene transduction, and covers various novel techniques to produce better vectors that specifically and efficiently target the heart. In this chapter, we provide an overview of currently
available cardiac gene delivery vectors and delivery methods.

Vectors
One of the most important factors for successful gene therapy is
the choice of vectors. Vectors determine the efficiency of transduction, tropism to the targeted tissues, degree of inflammation, and
length of transgene expression. Despite the progress in the identification of promising targets for the treatment of a number of cardiovascular diseases, the targeted delivery of therapeutic nucleic
acids yet remains a formidable hurdle especially in advanced mammalians. Nonetheless, over the past years, considerable advances
have been made in developing and improving several vector platforms. Broadly, these vectors can be classified into two groups:
nonviral vectors and recombinant viral vectors. Each of these vector systems has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and we
will briefly discuss the main vectors currently employed in cardiovascular gene therapy.

2.1 Nonviral Gene
Delivery

Naked plasmid DNA has been the predominant vector used in the
previous cardiac gene transfer trials that have employed nonviral
vectors, with only a few trials using lipofection [11]. The major
advantages of plasmid DNA include (1) the ease of large scale production, (2) the near absence of a DNA size limit, and (3) the limited innate, cellular and humoral immune response. The lack of a
significant humoral immune response against the vector is a great
advantage that allows repeat vector administration, which is one of
the major limitations of viral vectors. However, repeat vector
administration comes with an appreciable risk of serious adverse
events due to the administration procedure that often requires invasive procedures. Unfortunately, the Achilles heel of plasmid DNA

Methods Overview

as a gene delivery vehicle remains the low transfection efficiencies
[12]. Innate immune response to plasmid DNA is considered moderate and can also reduce transfection efficiency [13]. These limitations clearly indicate the necessity of a major breakthrough to
improve transfection efficiency to fully realize the potential of plasmid DNA gene transfer.
Recently, promising new nonviral gene transfer methods have
emerged. These approaches include modified mRNA [14]
(modRNAs) and exosome [15] mediated gene delivery. The use of
modified mRNAs has two main advantages: (1) ModRNAs, unlike
unmodified nucleic acids, do not bind to Toll-like receptors [16],
which could trigger apoptosis of the transfected cells. As a result,
modRNAs can transfect the cells very efficiently. (2) Because
mRNAs are translated in the cytoplasm, they do not need to be
imported into the nucleus for transgene expression, which poses a
formidable hurdle for transfection with DNA. ModRNAs trigger
high-level transgene expression, and unsurprisingly, transgene
expression is relatively short-lived, 2–6 days [14, 17]. Depending
on the application, this short, pulse-like expression can be either
disadvantageous or beneficial. For example, whereas the shortterm expression of proteins deficient in inherited cardiomyopathies
would most likely have no long-term therapeutic benefit, the
short-term expression of, for instance, growth factors and stem cell
recruiting factors [18] might not only be therapeutically optimal
but also safer. Recently, Turnbull et al. have shown that modRNA
mixed with nanoparticles delivered by direct injection into the
myocardium or by intracoronary fashion can induce expression as
fast as 20 min following delivery in rodent and in pig hearts [19].
Thus, for short-term and rapid expression, modRNA offers a safe
and reliable delivery system to the myocardium.
2.2

Viral Vectors

Recombinant viral vectors are often very efficient in delivering
therapeutic genetic material to the targeted cells compared to nonviral vectors. They all have their own characteristics and appropriate vector selection is one of the key components for successful
cardiac gene transfer.
To date, the majority of virus-mediated cardiovascular clinical
gene therapy trials have used adenoviral vectors. This vector has
the advantage of transducing a broad array of cell types, including
cardiomyocytes, with a high transgene expression, although transient. However, adenoviral vectors do not have cardiac tropism and
the transgene expression cannot be restricted to certain tissues or
cell types unless targeted specifically. The most significant limitation of adenoviruses for cardiovascular gene therapy is however,
that they trigger a strong immune response [20, 21]. The so-called
first-generation adenoviral vectors, which are deficient in only one
viral gene (usually E1), trigger a strong cellular immune response
[21], presumably as a result of the expression of adenoviral

6

proteins. However, even after removing most of the viral gene, i.e.,
gutless adenoviral vectors, a strong innate immune response against
the adenoviral capsid was triggered [22], a risk not to be taken
lightly in cardiac gene therapy.
Lentiviral vectors have been used experimentally in preclinical
cardiac gene therapy studies [23]. In contrast to γ-retroviral vectors,
lentiviral vectors can transduce nondividing cells such as cardiomyocytes. Moreover, long-term expression can be achieved in both
nondividing and dividing cells, because they integrate their genetic
material into the host genome. The immune response is in general
moderate [20], but similar to adenoviral vectors, lentiviral vectors
have no specific tropism to cells of the cardiovascular system, which
likely will require intramyocardial injection as a vector delivery
method when targeting cardiac cells. Moreover, lentiviral vectors
can cause insertional mutagenesis through the random integration
of DNA into the host genome, raising concerns for the aberrant
expression of important genes and to tumorigenesis. These limitations have restricted lentivirus use as a vector for in vivo cardiac
gene transfer, and it has been mainly used in ex vivo gene transfer to
reprogram cells or to induce cardiac progeny in stem cells [23].
AAVs are one of the most promising gene delivery platforms
for cardiac gene therapy. AAVs are small, non-enveloped, singlestranded DNA viruses that are nonpathogenic in general. Both
dividing and nondividing cells can be transduced by rAAVs and
they can trigger long-term transgene expression even in the absence
of genome integration in postmitotic tissues, such as the myocardium. One of the main advantages of rAAV vectors for cardiac
gene therapy is that multiple AAV serotypes display natural tropism
for cardiomyocytes [24, 25]. In small animal models of cardiac
diseases, this allows the systemic administration of rAAVs to efficiently transduce the myocardium. Unfortunately, the cardiac tropism of present AAV serotypes and variants is not perfect. As a
result, in large animal models—and most importantly in humans—
rAAVs carrying therapeutic genes need to be delivered regionally.
The cellular immune response against rAAVs is not very strong. In
clinical trials using the hepatotropic AAV serotype 8 to deliver factor IX to treat hemophilia B, two patients experienced a transient
transaminase increase, putatively as a result of an anti-AAV immune
response [26], but the liver transaminase levels rapidly returned to
normal after a short regimen of immune suppression. Interestingly,
a cellular immune response has not been detected in more than
300 patients in the CUPID 1 and 2 trials [7]. However, despite the
limited cellular immune response against rAAVs, the presence of
antecedent neutralizing antibodies emerged as a significant obstacle to the broad application of AAV gene therapy. Preexisting neutralizing antibodies against the naturally occurring serotypes,
presumably a result of a prior infection with wild-type AAVs, can
significantly reduce the transgene efficacy. In fact, more than half
the patients (up to 80 % in certain regions) who could have been

Methods Overview

potentially enrolled into the CUPID trial had to be excluded
because of antecedent neutralizing antibodies. Another limitation
of this vector is the limited packaging capacity (≤5 kb), which
restricts the genes that can be loaded in this vector. Clearly, methods to address these limitations have become increasingly important as cardiac gene therapy moves towards the clinic. Active
researches are ongoing to overcome these obstacles [27–29] and
rAAVs are arguably the most promising vectors currently available
for cardiac gene therapy.

3

Promoters
To achieve strong expression, constitutively active promoters such
as CMV (cytomegalovirus) or RSV (respiratory syncytial virus)
have been used. More recently, cardiac specific promoters emerged
to achieve cardiac specific expression to the heart. These include the
myosin heavy chain promoter, the myosin light chain promoter,
and troponin T promoter [30]. Unfortunately, even though a
higher specificity to the heart was conferred, the resulting expression is weaker compared to constitutively active promoters requiring higher doses of vectors. Novel cardiac-specific cis-acting
regulatory modules have been used to further restrict off-target
expression. Inducible promoters can be either activated or silenced
by a drug or a small molecule [31]. Disease specific promoters such
as ANF (atrial natriuretic factor) which are highly expressed in heart
failure have also been used experimentally to induce transduction
during volume enlargement in a dog model of heart failure [32].

4

Methods of Gene Transfer
Another key to successful cardiac gene therapy is to choose appropriate vector delivery methods. As mentioned previously, even the
most cardiac tropic vector, i.e., rAAV is not powerful enough to
transduce the heart specifically via intravenous route in large animals. Thus cardiac targeting is necessary to increase the specificity.
Cardiac targeting also increases the amount of vectors distributed
to the heart and thus important to increase the expression efficacy.
Representative cardiac delivery methods are illustrated in Fig. 1.
Each method exhibits different gene transfer efficiency, transgene
distribution pattern, and invasiveness. Thus, the optimal delivery
technique needs to be carefully determined considering the used
vector, targeted gene, treating disease, and patients’ condition. For
example, gene targets that are aimed to be over-expressed locally,
such as biological pacemaker may benefit more from focal transgene expression rather than homogeneous gene distribution
throughout the myocardium. Surgical delivery may be too invasive
for patients with NYHA class IV heart failure, whereas the heart is

It is important to note that safety is as important as efficacy in
delivering the genes and minimally invasive percutaneous
approaches are usually preferred when targeting patients with
chronic heart failure. In the following sections, we briefly review
representative cardiac targeting delivery methods.

Methods Overview

9

4.1 Intramyocardial
Delivery

The first successful cardiac gene transfer was demonstrated by
directly injecting the plasmid DNA into the myocardium [33].
This approach has the advantage of achieving higher vector concentration and presumably higher retention within the injection
site. Transgene distribution is focal, usually within 5–10 mm range
around the needle track. A surgical approach delivers vectors epicardially, while a catheter-based endovascular approach delivers
vectors to the endocardium. Direct visualization of the injection is
an advantage of surgical delivery, whereas endovascular approach
is likely less invasive. When an endovascular approach is used, site
of injection can be determined using electromechanical mapping
system, fluoroscopy, or CT. Unfortunately, even direct intramyocardial injection cannot prevent systemic leak of the vectors,
because the vectors leave the heart through venous drainage, the
lymph system, and from the injection needle holes. Thus, off-target distribution needs to be evaluated similar to other delivery
methods. It has been reported that the rate of retention decreases
when higher volumes are injected [34]. Thus, lower volume with
concentrated vectors seems to be the best option to accomplish
efficient gene transduction while minimizing off-target distribution using this approach.

4.2 Intravascular
Delivery

Antegrade coronary artery delivery is probably the most clinically
familiar approach to deliver the genes with cardiac targeting.
Similar devices and techniques used for coronary angiogram or
percutaneous coronary interventions can be applied. Homogenous
distribution of the transgene expression can be achieved using this
method. However, a single bolus injection of vectors through this
route results in limited expression. Using ex vivo system, Donahue
et al. found that higher coronary flow, longer virus exposure time,
and higher virus concentrations are critical factors to improve
myocardial vector uptake [35]. The importance of these factors
together with perfusion pressure for increasing the transduction
efficacy was later confirmed in vivo by us using a cross-clamp technique [36]. Vector administration during brief coronary occlusions can increase the relative vector concentration and exposure
time and results in improved transgene efficiency. However, coronary occlusions can cause stunning of the myocardium even with
very short ischemia and may predispose patients to adverse events
in the context of limited functional reserve in advanced heart failure. Retrograde injection of the vectors into the coronary sinus is
another intravascular approach. This approach has been shown to
increase the transduction efficiency compared to antegrade delivery, and is currently used in one of the clinical trials using plasmid
vectors (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01961726). Transgene
distribution using this method is less homogeneous with epicardial dominant expression [37] compared to the antegrade delivery. Because the vectors need to be administered against the
antegrade flow, this technique usually requires balloon occlusion

of both the coronary artery and the sinus to prevent rapid washout of the vectors. It is likely that the longer occlusion time would
result in higher gene expression, however prolonged occlusion
can increase the risk of causing delivery related complications and
the benefit of achieving higher efficiency needs to be balanced
with its risks. For intracoronary delivery, co-administration of permeability increasing agents (such as nitroglycerin) has been shown
to significantly increase the transduction efficacy and several different recipes are reported to be effective [32, 38]. Because the
gene delivery vectors are usually very small, they can easily pass
through the coronary capillaries unless they attach to the vessel
wall. To prevent the escape of vectors from the heart, recirculation of the vectors was proposed using a catheter system whereby
the coronary sinus is blocked and blood with the virus is recirculated to the coronary arteries (Osprey system) [39]. The
“Molecular Cardiac Surgery with Recirculating Delivery”
(MCARD) has been developed as an invasive cardiac surgical
technique that uniquely allows for in situ, multiple-pass recirculation of recombinant vector in the isolated coronary circulation in
large animals [40]. Both approaches appeared to improve cardiac
gene transduction; however, off-target distribution is not completely eliminated by both approaches.
4.3 Intrapericardial
Delivery

5

Percutaneous access to the pericardium space has become popular
after successful application of epicardial ablation for epicardial ventricular tachycardia. This space has also been used to deliver vectors, cells, and drugs, and their efficacy has been reported [41].
Although it is a closed space, there is a rapid turnover of the pericardial fluid and the vectors seem not to stay too long in the space
after delivery. To increase the retention inside the pericardium, we
have injected the vectors with biodegradable gel foam [42]. This
approach resulted in epicardial transduction; however, there was
no expression in the other layers suggesting very limited transmural penetration using this approach. Thus, additional modification
is likely required for targeting the myocardium.

Conclusion
Recent clinical trial results in cardiac gene therapy have made us
further realize the difficulty of effectively transducing in the myocardium in humans. It is clear that further improvements in gene
delivery tools and methods are required (Fig. 2), and newer
approaches described in this book will undoubtedly contribute to
future success of cardiac gene therapy in patients.

Silencing Genes in the Heart
Henry Fechner, Roland Vetter, Jens Kurreck, and Wolfgang Poller
Abstract
Silencing of cardiac genes by RNA interference (RNAi) has developed into a powerful new method to treat
cardiac diseases. Small interfering (si)RNAs are the inducers of RNAi, but cultured primary cardiomyocytes and heart are highly resistant to siRNA transfection. This can be overcome by delivery of small hairpin (sh)RNAs or artificial microRNA (amiRNAs) by cardiotropic adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors.
Here we describe as example of the silencing of a cardiac gene, the generation and cloning of shRNA, and
amiRNAs directed against the cardiac protein phospholamban. We further describe the generation of AAV
shuttle plasmids with self complementary vector genomes, the production of AAV vectors in roller bottles,
and their purification via iodixanol gradient centrifugation and concentration with filter systems. Finally we
describe the preparation of primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (PNRC), the transduction of PNRC with
AAV vectors, and the maintenance of the transduced cell culture.

Introduction
Gene silencing induced by RNA interference (RNAi) is widely
used in experimental research and has also shown its suitability for
the investigation of cardiac gene function and for the treatment of
cardiac diseases [1]. Small interfering (si) RNAs induce RNAi.
After transfection into cells, one strand of this roughly 19 bp long
double-stranded RNA binds to the mRNA of a target gene in a
sequence-specific manner and induces the degradation of its target
mRNA, leading to suppression of gene expression [2]. An as yet
unsolved problem of the employment of siRNA in the cardiac system is the low transfection efficiency of isolated cardiomyocytes
in vitro and of the heart in vivo. Moreover, cardiac specific in vivo
delivery of siRNA is challenging with regard to target organ specificity and long-term efficacy. These bottlenecks can be overcome
by delivery of small hairpin (shRNA) and artificial microRNAs
(amiRNAs), which are processed intracellular to mature siRNAs,
by cardiotropic adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors [3–5].

Henry Fechner et al.

Free available computer programs can be used to select siRNA,
shRNAs, and amiRNAs, directed against a specific target gene.
They can then easily be inserted into expression plasmids and subcloned into AAV shuttle plasmids containing essential AAV genome
sequences necessary for packaging of the AAV vector genome into
AAV capsids [3, 6]. Over the last decade, huge efforts were made
in the development of AAV vectors. Especially pseudotyped AAV
vectors, comprising a vector genome derived from AAV2 packaged
into the capsid of the AAV serotypes 6 and 9, showed improved
cardiotropism [7–9]. The generation of AAV vectors with a self
complementary (sc) vector genome represents a further milestone
in AAV vector development [10]. Compared to traditional AAV
vectors with single-stranded (ss) vector genomes, scAAV vectors
express transgenes earlier and reach faster maximal levels in the
heart [11]. This is of particular importance for investigation in cultured primary cardiomyocytes, which only survive in culture for a
short time [12, 13], as well as for in vivo investigations requiring
rapid gene silencing [3]. AAV vectors can be generated in culture
plates, flasks, or roller bottles using helper virus-free plasmid-based
packaging systems and purified by iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation and concentrated using specific filter systems. The vectors
can then be used directly for in vitro and in vivo applications [14].
Here we describe, as an example of cardiac gene silencing, the
development of shRNAs and amiRNAs directed against the cardiac
Ca2+ regulatory protein phospholamban (PLB), the generation of
AAV vector shuttle plasmids with sc vector genomes, the production of pseudotyped AAV2/6 and AAV2/9 vectors in roller bottles, their purification by iodixanol gradient centrifugation and
concentration with an Amicon® filter system. We further describe
the preparation of primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (PNRC),
its transduction with AAV vectors and maintenance of the transduced cell culture.

Methods
Use autoclaved double-distilled water (H2O) for all methods.

3.1 Cloning
of shRNAs
and amiRNAs
3.1.1 Cloning of shRNAs
Against Phospholamban

To enable vector delivery, an siRNA sequence (see Note 8) can be
converted into the corresponding shRNA (Fig. 1). The two strands
of the double-stranded RNA molecule are connected by a loop and
the shRNA is usually expressed under control of an RNA polymerase III promoter, e.g., the U6 or H1 promoter. The intracellular RNAi machinery will then process the shRNA to give the
mature siRNA. Various vectors are commercially available for the
expression of shRNAs. An example is the pSilencer 2.1-U6 neo
vector from Thermo Fisher Scientific (originally from Ambion).
The oligonucleotides encoding the shRNA are cloned between a
BamHI and a HindIII site (see Note 9). How to clone shRNA is
described in the following steps.
1. Mix 3 μg of pSilencer 2.1-U6 neo vector with 0.25 μl BamHI,
0.25 μl HindIII, 2 μl 10× restriction buffer and H2O ad 20 μl.
Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.
2. Add 0.5 μl Calf Intestine alkaline phosphatase, 2.5 μl 10× CIAP
buffer to the linearized vector and fill up with H2O to 25 μl.
3. Separate the linearized plasmid by agarose gel electrophoresis
using a 1 % agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/
ml). Cut out the gel slice containing vector band (see Note 10)
and isolate the DNA fragments using a gel extraction kit.
Estimate the vector concentration on a separate agarose gel
with a standardized marker (see Note 11).

Henry Fechner et al.

Fig. 1 Schematic of siRNA, shRNA and amiRNA directed against phospholamban [6]. (a) The target site in the
mRNA is underlined. (b) The standard design of an siRNA comprises a 19mer duplex and two deoxythymidine
overhangs at both 3′ ends. (c) For the shRNA approach, the two strands of the siRNA are connected by a loop.
The oligonucleotides encoding the shRNA are shown below the shRNA. Please note that the second oligonucleotide is shown in 3′–5′ direction for clarity in this illustration, but must be in the 5′–3′ direction when ordered.
For cloning, a BamHI and a HindIII site are added to the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. A GC pair needs to be
introduced upstream of the sequence encoding the sense strand in case the siRNA starts with a U or C (as in
the case of the shown shRNA targeting phospholamban). A series of six Ts terminates polymerase III transcription. (d) For the amiRNA approach, the siRNA sequence is inserted into the sequence environment of a natural
microRNA, e.g., the murine miR-155 encoded for example by the BLOCK-iT™ Pol II miR RNAi Expression
Vector Kit (Invitrogen). The miR-155 flanking sequences were optimized for higher knockdown efficiency and
facilitated sequence analysis. The oligonucleotides encoding the amiRNA were designed for cloning into the
pcDNA 6.2-GW vector (Invitrogen). Again, the second oligonucleotide is shown in 3′–5′ direction for clarity, but
needs to be ordered in the 5′–3′ direction. The active RNA antisense strand is always written in bold

4. Mix 100 pmol of each of the oligonucleotides with annealing
buffer ad 50 μl. Heat to 95 °C for 4 min; slowly cool to room
temperature.
5. Mix 2 μl of oligonucleotides annealing mixture with 1 μl ATP,
1 μl T4 polynucleotide kinase, 1 μl 10× T4 PNK buffer and
H2O ad 10 μl. Incubate for 30 min at 37 °C. Inactivate T4
polynucleotide kinase by heating to 70 °C for 10 min.

6. Mix 50 ng of linearized, dephosphorylated plasmid with 5 μl
of mixture with phosphorylated oligonucleotides, 1 μl T4
DNA ligase, 1 μl 10× T4 DNA ligation buffer and H2O ad
10 μl. Incubate at 16 °C overnight.
7. Transform the ligation mixture into competent E. coli cells
according to standard procedures.
8. Pick bacteria colonies next day and carry out plasmid preparation using a plasmid miniprep kit. Control the correctness of
the plasmid by restriction analysis and sequencing. Carry out
plasmid maxi preparation using a plasmid maxiprep kit
(see Note 12).
3.1.2 Cloning
of amiRNAs
Against Phospholamban

For this procedure the siRNA sequence is inserted into the sequence
environment of a naturally occurring microRNA, commonly miR30 or miR-155 (Fig. 1). This approach has four major advantages:
(1) amiRNA systems are highly efficient, as the endogenous miRNA
pathway is used. (2) Some RNA polymerase II promoters are—in
contrast to RNA polymerase III promoters—tissue-specific. (3)
The amiRNA system may be used to co-express a protein-encoding
cDNA, e.g., GFP as a reporter. (4) amiRNAs can be inserted into
an expression cassette as repetitive copies and together with a transgene. Cloning of an amiRNA directed against PLB with the
BLOCK-iT™ Pol II miR RNAi Expression Vector Kit (Invitrogen)
is described here as an example.
1. The vector pcDNA™6.2-GW/miR is supplied as a linearized
plasmid.
2. Mix 5 μl of each of the oligonucleotides (200 μM) with 2 μl of
10× oligo annealing buffer and 8 μl H2O. Heat the mixture at
95 °C for 4 min. Slowly cool down to room temperature.
Dilute the mixture to obtain a final concentration of the
double-stranded oligonucleotide of 10 nM.
3. Mix 2 μl of linearized pcDNA™6.2-GW/miR with 4 μl of the
double-stranded oligonucleotides, 4 μl of 5× T4 DNA ligase
buffer, 1 μl T4 DNA Ligase and 9 μl H2O. Incubate for 5 min
at room temperature.
4. Transform the ligation mixture into competent E. coli cells
according to standard procedures.
5. Pick bacteria colonies next day and carry out further analysis as
described under Subheading 3.1.1, step 8.

3.2 Generation
of AAV Shuttle
Plasmids with Self
Complementary (sc)
AAV Vector Genome

To express a transgene, AAV vectors with single-stranded (ss) vector genomes need to intracellularly convert their single-stranded
DNA genome into double-stranded DNA genomes [15]. This
takes days to weeks and is the main reason for delayed onset of
transgene expression after transduction. In contrast, transgene
expression rapidly increases when scAAV vector are used [11].

Fig. 2 Generation of AAV shuttle plasmid by deletion of terminal resolution site in pAAV-MCS (a) AAV vector
genome sequence of left and right AAV2 ITR with trs and MscI and HincII restriction sites. (b) Partial sequence
of left and right AAV2 ITRs after insertion of a 1230 bp long MscI/HincII fragment (red) into the 2800 bp long
plasmid backbone of MscI/HincII digested pAAV-MCS. MCS multi cloning site, trs terminal resolution site; Dots,
stretches of unwritten nucleotides

In these vectors both DNA strands are packaged as a single molecule, forming a dimeric vector genome, which can directly be used
for transcription. scAAV vectors can be generated by deleting the
terminal resolution site (trs) sequence in one AAV ITR. How to
delete the trs is described in the following steps (see also Fig. 2).
1. Mix 5 μg pAAV-MCS (see Note 13) with 1 μl (5 U) MscI,
0.5 μl HincII, 5 μl 10× restriction buffer and H2O ad 50 μl
and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.
2. Separate the digested plasmid fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis using a 1 % agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml). Cut out gel slices containing a 2800 and
1230 bp band (see Note 10) and isolate the DNA fragments
using a gel extraction kit. Estimate the concentration of each
DNA fragment on a separate agarose gel by comparison with
a standardized marker.
3. Mix 100 ng of the 2800 bp fragment with 250 ng of the
1230 bp fragment (total volume ≤ 17 μl), add 1 μl T4 DNA
ligase, 2 μl 10× T4 DNA ligation buffer and H2O ad 20 μl and
incubate for 1 h at room temperature.
4. Transform competent E. coli with the mixture (see Notes 14
and 15) and transfer the bacteria solution to agar plates
according to standard procedures.
5. Plasmid isolation: Pick positive colonies next day and carry out
plasmid minipreparation using commercial plasmid miniprep

AAV Vectors for Cardiac Gene Silencing

27

kits and control correctness of the plasmid by restriction
analysis and sequencing. Use plasmid maxiprep kits for maxipreparations of large amounts of the scAAV shuttle plasmid
(see Note 16).
6. To generate shRNA and amiRNA expressing scAAV shuttle
plasmids, the respective expression cassettes can be cut out
from respective plasmids (see Subheadings 3.1.1 and 3.1.2)
and subcloned into the scAAV shuttle plasmid (see Note 17)
using standard cloning procedures.
3.3 Production
of AAV Vectors
in Roller Bottles
(see Note 18)

Recombinant AAV vectors can be produced by co-transfection of
the 293T host cell line with an AAV shuttle vector plasmid, a helper
plasmid containing genetic information of adenoviral helper gene
products (E2A, E4, VA RNA) and another plasmid expressing AAV
replicase and capsid gene products (e.g., for generation of scAAV2/9
vectors). Alternatively the adenoviral helper function and the AAV
replicase and capsid genes may be expressed from a single plasmid.
Here only two plasmids, the helper and the AAV shuttle plasmid,
are necessary to generate AAV vectors (e.g., for generation of
scAAV2/6 vectors). The following protocol can be used for the
production of ssAAV vectors and scAAV vectors. Generated vectors
can be used directly for in vitro and in vivo transduction.
1. Coat roller bottle with 35 ml collagen solution (see Note 19)
and incubate it in a Heracell 240i CO2 incubator on the bottle
turning device for 30 min at 37 °C. Roller bottles should spin
with 0.2 rpm during this and all further incubation steps
(see Note 20).
2. Prior to cell seeding, wash the coated surface of the roller bottles with 25 ml 1× PBS. For wash steps the bottle can also be
spun by hand. To seed the cells, carefully add 6 × 107 HEK293T
cells to the bottom of the bottle (see Note 21). Add 200 ml
DMEM complete medium to the cells and put the bottle onto
the bottle turning device in the Heracell 240i CO2 incubator.
Let cells grow at 37 °C, 5 % CO2 for 48 h. Check the confluence of the cells. If cell density reaches about 80 %, the cells
can be transfected.
3. According to the desired vector, prepare the transfection
solutions Mix A and Mix B as described in Table 1 using PEI
(see Note 22). Consolidate Mix B and Mix A, vortex and incubate the transfection mix at room temperature for 15 min.
4. Remove 60 ml media from the roller bottle and store it as
conditioned media.
5. Add 14 ml of the transfection mix to the roller bottle and
incubate at 37 °C, 5 % CO2 for 72 h.
6. Decant the supernatants (about 154 ml) into 200 ml
Erlenmeyer flask (see Note 24) and wash the cells with 25 ml
1× PBS.

3.7 Isolation
of Primary Neonatal rat
Cardiomyocytes
(PNRC), Its Transduction
with AAV Vectors and
Maintenance of the
Transduced Cell Culture

To characterize the posttranscriptional inhibition of selected cardiac targets (e.g., PLB) using small interfering RNAs such as
shRNA or amiRNAs, cultured primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (PNRC) have been proven to be a valuable experimental
model [4, 6, 13]. Therefore, the preparation of primary neonatal
heart cell cultures from ventricular tissue of 1–3-day-old rat pups,
described by Vetter et al. [12] earlier, will be specified here as a
detailed protocol.
1. Wipe down a hood with either Barrycidal or 70 % ethanol.
2. Pour 20 ml ice-cold 1× CIM with P/S into each of two or
three sterile 100 mm petri dishes.
3. Wash five neonatal rats (see Note 37) at a time in two sequential weigh boats with 70 % ethanol.
4. Holding a pup with large forceps, dip briefly into 70 % ethanol,
decapitate with large scissors, place the decapitated neonate on
its back on the stack of paper towels. Repeat this procedure for
the remaining four pups. Before continuing, wash another set

weigh boats. Hold the decapitated animals down with forceps,

AAV Vectors for Cardiac Gene Silencing

dab the ventral thorax area with a sterile swab using another
pair of forceps and make a midline incision through the sternum using a small pair of scissors (see Note 38). Press downward with the large forceps to pop the heart out through this
incision. Clip the heart out with the small pair of scissors and
carefully transfer to the petri dish filled with 20 ml 1× CIM
with P/S with the small forceps. Repeat this procedure with
the other pups. Up to 25 hearts per dish can be pooled.
5. After all the hearts have been collected, trim away the atria and
any other tissue such as connective tissue or fat from each
heart. Transfer the remaining heart (consisting now of the
right and left ventricle only) to a second petri dish with 20 ml
ice-cold 1× CIM with P/C, where the remaining heart should
be cut into 3–4 tissue pieces using small forceps and scissors.
Alternatively, cutting into pieces can also be performed using
two scalpels. Finally, pool all tissue pieces of the dissected
hearts in the latter dish (see Note 39).
6. Carefully withdraw 1× CIM with P/C from the petri dish
using a Pasteur pipette. Add 20 ml ice-cold 1× CIM to wash
the tissue pieces and withdraw the solution from the petri dish
again. Repeat the latter procedure once more. Thereafter, add
15 ml 1× CIM into the dish (see Note 40).
7. Transfer the complete content of the petri dish including all
tissue pieces into a sterile spinner flask. Remove the buffer
with a sterile Pasteur pipette and add depending on the
number of hearts used 8–15 ml antibiotic-free 1× CIM with
trypsin as indicated in Table 3.
8. Incubate the content in the spinner flask jacketed with
36–37 °C thermostatic H2O under continuous stirring with
150 rpm. Remove and discard the digestion buffer after
3–5 min (see Note 41).
9. Add 10 ml 1× CIM with trypsin and incubate at
36–37 °C. Remove the digestion buffer carefully after 15 min

using a sterile culture pipette and transfer the content into a
prepared 50 ml conic centrifuge tube filled with 5 ml ice-cold
HS (In case you have added 15 ml 1× CIM with trypsin, the
removed digestion buffer should be transferred into a prepared 50 ml conic centrifuge tube filled with 6.5 ml ice-cold
HS). Mix the content of the centrifuge tube carefully. Add
another 10 or 15 ml 1× CIM with trypsin to the Spinner flask
and incubate as indicated before. While this next digestion is
running, centrifuge the centrifuge tube at 300–400 × g for
8 min using centrifuge equipped with a swing out rotor. Set
the centrifugation conditions to slow acceleration, minimal
brake, and room temperature. Use this schedule to perform
another five digestion steps, with subsequent cell collection,
using centrifugation in each step (see Note 42).
10. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant from the centrifuge tube after centrifugation. Add 1 ml FCS plus 1 ml
CMRL1515-ATM to this tube and resuspend the cell pellet
carefully. Perform this procedure for all cell pellets in the six
centrifuge tubes obtained after centrifugation and pool the
contents of the six tubes into a single tube.
11. Filter the pooled crude cell suspension through two layers of
gauze into one sterile 50 ml conic centrifuge tube using a sterile 40 mm glass funnel. Centrifuge the tube at 300–400 × g for
8 min as indicated under step 9. Remove and discard the
supernatant carefully after centrifugation (see Note 43).
12. Resuspend the obtained cell pellet in complete gentamycincontaining CMRL1415-ATM cell culture medium supplemented with 10 % of FCS and 10 % HS (FCS/
HS-CMRL1415-ATM) each and transfer the crude cell suspension into a 175 ml culture flask.
13. Incubate the cell suspension in an incubator for 90 min at
37 °C for selective attachment of non-muscular cells. In general, use 1 ml of this medium per one heart used for digestion,
i.e., for 10 hearts use 10 ml medium, for 20 hearts use 20 ml,
etc. At the end of the incubation period, carefully remove the
cardiomyocyte-enriched medium from the culture flask and
transfer it into a 50 ml conic centrifuge tube using a disposable
plastic tissue culture pipette.
14. Pipette 50 μl of the obtained cell suspension into a micro tube
together with 50 μl 1× PBS and 50 μl Trypan blue and mix the
contents carefully. Immediately use a sample of this mixture to
count the number of PNRC using a Neubauer improved
hemocytometer and a microscope. Count the number of
PNRC in each of four quadrants and calculate the mean value.
For final calculation of the cell density, take into consideration
the 1:3 dilution of the original cardiomyocyte-enriched
medium obtained under step 13.

AAV Vectors for Cardiac Gene Silencing

33

15. Adjust the cell density cardiomyocyte-enriched medium
(obtained under step 13) to 4 × 105 cells/ml using FCS/HSCMRL1415-ATM with gentamycin. Distribute this cardiomyocyte containing medium either to cell culture plates or cell
culture flasks depending on the demands of the planned
experiments. For later transduction of the cultured cardiomyocytes with viral vectors a seeding cell density of 1.25 × 105 cells/
cm2 is recommended. To reach this density, volumes of 3.0 ml,
1.5 ml, and 1 ml/well of the cardiomyocyte-enriched medium
with 4 × 105 cells/ml are needed if distributed to round 6-well,
12-well, or 24-well culture plates, respectively (see Note 44).
16. Incubate the cell culture plates for 24 h at 37 °C in an incubator (see Note 45).
17. After the latter incubation period remove and discard the
medium and add to each well of the culture plates the indicated volumes (as described under Subheading 3.7, step 15)
of complete CMRL1415-ATM cell culture medium with 10 %
FCS containing also 2 μM FUDR in addition to 20 μg/ml
gentamycin (see Note 46).
18. After another 48 h of incubation replace the medium by fresh
CMRL1415-ATM cell culture medium with 10 % FCS, 2 μM
FUDR, and 20 μg/ml gentamycin and transduce the cells with
scAAV vectors by directly adding the vector into the cell culture medium and incubate at 37 °C as before (see Note 47).
19. Twenty four hours later the cell culture medium containing the
viral vector can be removed and discarded. The wells of the
plates are washed once with 1 ml, 1.5 ml, or 3 ml 1× PBS,
depending on the type of plates used, respectively, to get rid of
the non-absorbed viral vector. Thereafter, add fresh CMRL1415ATM cell culture medium with 10 % FCS, 2 μM FUDR, and
20 μg/ml gentamycin to the wells and incubate at 37 °C as
indicated above. Using medium changes every 24–48 h, the
spontaneously contracting PNRC can be cultured until they are
harvested after 4–14 days in culture (see Note 48).

Notes
1. Using this procedure the volume of the solution will be
increased by 150 ml.
2. Do not store this glucose containing solution longer than
3 days at 4 °C.
3. Most commercially available trypsin preparations for cell cultures purposes will not work properly for neonatal cardiomyocyte preparation. Best results can be obtained with crude
trypsin preparations, although not all crude enzyme prepara-

34

Henry Fechner et al.

tions will work properly and vary from lot to lot. Therefore, it
is necessary to prescreen several lots of crude trypsin before
selecting a lot to purchase. We have successfully used crude
porcine trypsin 1:250 from (Belger Biochemie, Kleinmachnow,
Germany, Lot 0110795).
4. First use a 20 or 50 ml syringe with a disposable filter unit
(0.45 μM pore size) to filter the entire volume. Thereafter, use
a 10 ml syringe with another disposable filter unit (0.22 μM
pore size) to filter 10 ml portions to sterility of the prefiltered
10× trypsin. This procedure is recommended to prevent plugging of the 0.22 μM filter.
5. CMRL stands for Connaught Medical Research Laboratories
and ATM stands for atmosphere. The bicarbonate-free medium
has a high buffering capacity and a 5 % CO2 atm and thus a CO2
incubator is not needed for cell cultures growing in this
medium. Moreover, cell cultures can be handled outside the
incubator without substantial changes in the pH of the medium.
6. Usually 500 ml CMRL1415-ATM are delivered by the supplier in 500 ml bottles. It is recommended to remove 2 ml
from such a bottle. Thereafter, add the indicated volumes of
ingredients of 1000× CaCl2 and 1000× FUDR to the
CMRL1415-ATM containing bottle. This will guarantee the
correct final concentrations of CaCl2 (1.26 mM), FUDR
(2 μM), and gentamycin (10 μg/ml).
7. We routinely calculate approx. 25 ml of this solution for isolation of cardiomyocytes from five neonatal rat hearts. Accordingly,
a higher volume is needed if higher numbers of hearts are used,
e.g., prepare 250 ml of this solution for 50 hearts.
8. Various criteria for the design of efficient siRNAs have been
suggested, including a GC content between 30 and 52 %, A
or U in positions 15–19, lack of internal repeats, A at positions 3 and 19, U at position 10, G or C at position 19 and G
at position 13 [16]. In addition, structural restrictions of the
target site have to be taken into consideration [17]. Various
programs are provided at no cost to support the design of
siRNAs, e.g.: http://dharmacon.gelifesciences.com/designcenter/ or http://rnaidesigner.thermofisher.com/rnaiexpress/design.do. Alternatively, use one of the known active
siRNAs published for most human and rodent genes in recent
years. Furthermore, various companies offer predesigned and
validated siRNAs with a silencing guarantee. It is still advisable to test three to four siRNAs for a given target to find the
most efficient candidate. The standard design for siRNAs
comprises a 19mer duplex with two nucleotide overhangs at
both 3′ ends. Figure 1 shows an example of an active siRNA
targeting phospholamban.

9. As the prices for DNA synthesis have dropped dramatically in
recent years, one may chose the option not to clone oligonucleotides downstream of the promoter, but rather to have
parts or the entire expression cassette synthesized. This strategy is usually much faster, less labor-intensive and only slightly
more expensive.
10. Put the agarose gel on a UV transilluminator to visualize the
bands and cut out the gel slices with a scalpel. Be careful to
protect your eyes with UV protective glasses and wear protective gloves to prevent contact with the gel, as ethidium bromide, used to make the DNA bands visible, is toxic. The vector
backbone (2800 bp DNA fragment) can be dephosphorylated
to prevent the MscI sites from religating.
11. Dephosphorylation enhances the efficiency of cloning by preventing religation of vector DNA which was only cleaved by
one of the restriction enzymes.
12. Plasmid maxipreparation yield large amounts of plasmid DNA,
making it easier to subclone an expression cassette into AAV
shuttle plasmids. In principle, plasmids isolated by plasmid
mini preparation can also be used for subcloning.
13. pAAV-MCS is a plasmid containing an AAV vector genome
which consists of the 5′ and 3′ ITRs from AAV2.
14. We suggest using recombination deficient (recA) bacteria,
e.g., XL10-Gold Ultracompetent cells (Stratagene) for cloning to prevent recombination of AAV ITRs.
15. After restriction with MscI/HincII, the 1230 bp DNA fragment has blunt ends. Therefore it is possible that after ligation
the fragment is inserted in two different orientations in the plasmid, leading to destruction of either the left or right AAV ITR.
Either plasmid, containing a deletion of the right or left ITR,
can be used as AAV shuttle plasmid to generate scAAV vectors.
16. Plasmid mini- and maxiprep kits are supplied by several companies. The plasmid maxiprep kits are typically used to produce high amounts of plasmid DNA which are necessary for
AAV preparation. To prevent possible toxic side effects during
AAV production, use endotoxin free plasmid maxiprep kits.
17. The vector DNA present in the AAV shuttle plasmid (representing the nucleotide number from the 5′ end of the left to
the 3′ end of the right ITR in the AAV shuttle plasmid) should
not exceed 2.4 kb for reliable packaging. Despite reports that
larger AAV vector genomes can be packaged, we were unable
to consistently package scAAV genomes exceeding this critical
threshold. ShRNAs and amiRNA expression cassettes are typically smaller than this size, and therefore packaging of the
respective expression cassettes in AAV genomes should be
unproblematic. The lower limit of scAAV vector genome size

36

Henry Fechner et al.

is currently unknown. We found that scAAV vector genomes
with total length of 975 bp can be successfully packaged.
18. The method is described for production of AAV vectors in one
roller bottle. One roller bottle is sufficient for production of a
total of 1 × 1010–1 × 1011 scAAV vectors (determined as vector
genomes (vg) by quantitative PCR). For large-scale production we generally use a minimum of 6–10 roller bottles. You
can also use standard disposable cell culture vessels (flasks or
plates) for production. One roller bottle replaces approximately 10 cell culture plates (14.5 cm diameter).
19. The collagen is available from Sigma-Aldrich (Cat. No.
C8919). For details of preparation of the collagen solution go
http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/
to:
articles/biofiles/collagen-product-protocols.html#sthash.
Y5GaCDUp.dpuf
20. Removed collagen solution can be reused. We have reused it
for up to 10 times. Coated roller bottles can be stored at 4 °C
for several days.
21. In each step when a solution is added/removed from the roller
bottle set down the bottle gently to avoid shaking off cells.
Also avoid spraying added solutions onto the walls of the bottle where cells are growing, as this may lead to unintentional
detachment of the cells.
22. Before use, PEI must be warmed up at 65 °C for 10 min to
ensure the PEI is completely dissolved.
23. For packaging of pseudotyped scAAV2/6 vectors (containing
ITRs of AAV2 and capsids of AAV6) the pDP6 plasmid is
used. It contains essential adenoviral helper functions and the
replicase gene of AAV2 and the capsid gene of AAV6. For
packaging of pseudotyped scAAV2/9 vectors (containing
ITRs of AAV2 and capsids of AAV9) the adenoviral helper
functions (E2a, E4, and VA RNA) and the replicase gene of
AAV2 and the capsid gene of AAV9 are on separate plasmids,
pHelper and p5E18VD2/9, respectively.
24. The supernatant also contains AAV vectors, but the yield is
usually low compared to the cells collected from the roller
bottle. Therefore isolation of AAV vectors from the supernatant (see Subheading 3.4) is often not recommended.
25. Rinse the lateral surfaces of the roller bottle with the cell solution while gently spinning the bottle by hand to detach all cells
from the walls.
26. Prolonged centrifugation (30 min) leads to more compact
pellets. Be careful with decantation to avoid discarding the cell
pellet.
27. The suspension can directly be used in the next step or be
stored at −80 °C until use.

AAV Vectors for Cardiac Gene Silencing

37

28. The solution can be stored at −80 °C or directly filtered with
the iodixanol gradient system.
29. In most cases this step will not lead to a drastic increase of total
vector yield. Therefore this step is optional.
30. Store the solution at −80 °C or go to filtration with iodixanol
gradient system.
31. Let the AAV solution run down on the wall of the tube very
slowly to avoid swirls within the iodixanol layers. The maximum capacity of the tube for AAV solution is about 14 ml. Do
not overload the gradients: A ratio of 2 roller bottles of AAV
isolates per gradient should not be exceeded.
32. The centrifuge tube has an obvious mark on its neck. Be sure
that the tube is filled exactly to the mark, otherwise the tube
will collapse during ultracentrifugation. Tare the centrifuge
tubes as exactly as possible (e.g., to the fourth digit on a milligram scale).
33. If the cannula is pricked into the tube, the open angle of the
cannula must point upwards. When you remove the cannula
from the tube, the contents of the tube will leak out the punctured site. Therefore, we hold the tube over a 50 ml centrifuge
tube and drop it into the tube immediately after pulling out
the cannula. AAV vector solution can be stored at −80 °C.
34. If solution remains in the tube and does not pass through
(which is a result of remaining iodixanol in the preparation),
resuspend and rinse the membrane of the Amicon® Ultra
15 ml centrifugal filters with the remaining volume or extend
centrifugation time.
35. For large volumes of AAV, several Amicon® Ultra 15 ml centrifugal filters can be used in parallel. After centrifugation the
concentrated AAV solutions can be combined and concentrated
further using a fresh Amicon® Ultra 15 ml centrifugal filter. Be
careful if an Amicon® Ultra 15 ml centrifugal filter is centrifuged several times. The more often a column is centrifuged,
the higher the probability of leaks and therefore loss of AAVs.
36. Use a suitable micropipette for resuspension to avoid formation of foam. Concentrated scAAV vectors can be stored
at −80 °C.
37. Newborn Sprague Dawley or Wistar rats can be used. However,
use 1–3 day old pups only. Do not use neonates older than
3 days, because the hearts of these animals have a more extensive extracellular matrix, which hampers its trypsin-catalyzed
digestion and needs more digestion time. Extending digestion
times may lead to enhanced trypsin-related damage of PNRC.
As a consequence the number of viable PNRC will decline
and an excessive number of non-surviving cells will be found
in culture.

38

Henry Fechner et al.

38. The length of the incision should be less than half of the length
of the body. It should not extend across the thorax–abdomen
border.
39. Complete removal of atria is very important. Contaminating
atrial pace maker cells in the culture of spontaneously beating
PNRC will result in a markedly increased contraction rate.
40. These washing steps are necessary to get rid of penicillin and
streptomycin which could be harmful to the PNRC during the
following enzymatic digestion.
41. This first digestion allows the removal of broken cells as well as
blood cells. The temperature during this digestion step as well
as the following ones should be continuously checked and
protocoled. It should not exceed 37 °C. Otherwise
trypsin-catalyzed digestion will result in excessive cell damage
leading to an increased number of dead cells in the sought
culture.
42. Too rapid acceleration of the centrifuge rotor may damage the
enzymatically isolated PNRC, while too rapid deceleration will
result in loss of PNRC due to turbulence causing some pelleted cells to be lost to the supernatant.
43. This filtration step through sterile gauze is used to remove
feasible cell debris of larger size from the cell suspension.
44. For firm attachment and growth of the isolated PNRC we
strongly recommend using flasks and cell culture multidishes
with Nunclon™ Delta surface coating. If you intend to use
other types of plastic culture material for attachment and
growth of the PNRC, they must first be tested. In some cases
premature surface coating with collagen or another suitable
surface coating substance may be needed.
45. Using CMRL1415-ATM medium during incubation no CO2
supply is needed. Therefore, if a CO2-incubator is being used,
adjust the CO2 supply to zero. This also holds true for all following incubation steps.
46. The mitosis inhibitor FUDR is added to reduce division and
growth of contaminating fibroblasts, which, in contrast to
PNRC, will otherwise proliferate substantially in the serumcontaining medium.
47. At this time point spontaneously contracting PNRC usually
will have reached a confluence of about 70–80 %.
48. We have been successful keeping contracting PNRC in culture
for up to 21 days. However, keep in mind that the number of
fibroblasts in the culture will increase continuously, even in the
presence of 2 μM FUDR. Higher concentrations of the inhibitor to achieve complete suppression of fibroblast mitosis
should not be used, due to its toxicity to PNRC.

Generation of Efficient miRNA Inhibitors
Using Tough Decoy Constructs
Jimeen Yoo, Roger J. Hajjar, and Dongtak Jeong
Abstract
Over the last decade a previously unappreciated mechanism of gene regulation has been uncovered that is
mediated by a large class of small noncoding RNAs known as microRNAs (miRNAs), and this mechanism
is utilized by organisms ranging from plants to humans. MiRNAs are important downregulators of gene
expression and are seen to be dysregulated in disease development. Thus inhibition of aberrantly upregulated miRNAs as a therapeutic approach has become a promising field.
Many models of miRNA inhibitors currently exist, with decoy models being the most successful in
current research. A promising inhibition model is the tough decoy (TuD) RNAs inhibitor, which uses
antisense sequences to bind to target miRNAs, preventing them from binding to their endogenous targets.
Since the TuD inhibitors have the ability to be successfully used in vitro and in vivo studies, this is a covetable inhibition method. In this chapter, we introduce how to design and generate miRNA tough decoy
inhibitors with an adeno-associated viral construct. TuD inhibitors will have two miRNA binding sites.
The TuD will include stem sequences, a miRNA binding site, and linkers. In vitro validation experiments
to confirm the effectiveness of the TuD to inhibit miRNA are described. We also propose some practical
approaches for making a TuD for miRNA of interest. We hope this chapter facilitates readers to create a
simpler method to generate TuD that can be used for miRNA loss of function studies.

Introduction

1.1 miRNA Function
and Biogenesis

Noncoding intron regions of mRNA have been previously ignored
as important regions encoding genetic information but the discovery of microRNA (miRNA) has shed light into these once disregarded regions. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that
are about 21–26 nucleotides in length and mainly downregulates
gene expression by binding to mRNA targets and preventing translation [1]. Depending on miRNA levels, phenotypes can be profoundly altered in the cell. Thus this short sequence plays an
important regulatory role in RNA silencing and posttranscriptional
modification ranging from development to disease pathophysiology.
The functional ability of miRNA has rendered it as a potential

Fig. 1 Biogenesis of mRNA, miRNA, and miRNA inhibitor. (a) The target mRNA molecule is processed by RNA
Pol II or III and transported to the cytoplasm where it can interact with the miRNA RISC complex. (b) The miRNA
is transcribed by RNA Pol II or III forming a pri-miRNA complex. (c) The miRNA inhibitor of choice, in this case
a tough decoy-type inhibitor, is transcribed from the vector delivered inhibitor cassette

therapeutic target. The biogenesis of miRNA is comparable to that
of mRNA since both share regulatory elements, and often also shares
a primary transcript (Fig. 1). MiRNA can be derived from either its
own gene or from the intron of pre-mRNA. The gene or intron is
transcribed by an RNA polymerase. Most miRNA were found to be
transcribed by RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II) with exceptions of
Alu-repetitive sequences which are transcribed by RNA Pol III [2].
The initial transcription sequence, the pri-miRNA, folds on itself to
create one or more of a stem-loop precursor. This sequence can

contain more than one functional miRNA. The pri-mRNA, which
contains a 5′ guanosine-triphosphate cap and a polyadenosine tail, is
then ready for splicing. Then the pri-mRNA is processed in the
nucleus by the heterotetramer microprocessor complex which
includes two RNase III Drosha and two Digeorge Syndrome Critical
Region 8 (DGCR8/pasha). The microprocessor works in conjunction with cofactors such as the DEAD box RNA helicases p68 and
p72 and heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins. The RNase III Drosha
is an enzyme and the DGCR8 acts as the pri-miRNA recognition
and binding site. The DGCR8/Drosha complex cleaves the RNA to
form a stem-loop pre-microRNA complex that is about 70 nucleotides long. Exportin-5 then recognizes the pre-miRNA by a two
nucleotide overhang at the 3′ end and exports it to the cytoplasm
through a GTP-GDP gradient [3]. In some noncanonical pathways,
miRNA biogenesis occurs without the microprocessor step [4].
Once the pre-miRNA enters the cytoplasm, a dicer complex
containing two RNase domains is able to excise the miRNA to
generate products with 2-nucleotide overhangs on the 3′ end. This
miRNA duplex unwinds to yield two mature miRNAs which are
22–26 nucleotides in length. One gets incorporated into the RISC
complex while the other is often degraded. In some cases, the
complementary strand is also used as a functional miRNA that
binds to other mRNA strands. The miRNA then binds to the
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) through the argonaute
family of proteins. The RISC complex allows for interaction
between the mature miRNA and the target mRNA.
Since miRNA are short sequences, they lack specificity and can
have many target mRNA. MiRNAs binds to its target mRNA by
imperfect or near perfect to perfect base pairing that mostly occurs
in the 3′-untranslated region (3′ UTR) with some found in the
5′-untraslated region or the coding region. When miRNA binds to
the 3′ UTR it can effect stability, localization, and translation of the
target mRNA. This occurs by the inhibitor binding to the seed
region of the miRNA, which are the 2′–7′ nucleotides on the 5′
end. Although miRNA composition and mechanism of action still
remains uncertain, miRNA-mediated inhibition is known to heavily
rely on base pairing between the miRNA and mRNA. In imperfect
complementarity, degradation or suppression of mRNA occurs,
while perfect to near perfect complementarity promotes mRNA
cleavage [5]. Thus the ability of miRNA to modulate mRNA activity has given rise to interest in miRNA regulating oligonucleotides.
1.2 miRNA Inhibitors
Can Manipulate
miRNA Function

Oligonucleotide manipulation methods have been widely studied
and used as an effective approach to produce miRNA inhibitors.
Current widely used available techniques to inhibit miRNA
function include but are not limited to: chemically modified short
single stranded oligonucleotides, antagomiRs, locked nucleic
acids, microRNA sponge, and miRNA decoy models (Fig. 2).

tough decoy. (a) AntagomiR with characteristic single perfect miRNA target site. (b) LNA has shorter complementation sequences which allow for binding to families of miRNA. (c) Sponge inhibitor with eight consecutive

(e) Tough Decoy inhibitor with characteristic hairpin structure containing two bulged miRNA target sites

These techniques bind to miRNA, inhibiting miRNAs from
binding to mRNAs. However, these targeting strategies vary in
mechanism of inhibition.
Chemically modified oligonucleotides, also known as antimiRs, have sequences complementarity beyond the seed region
and have successfully been used to block miRNA function in preclinical animal models [6, 7]. AntagomiRs often contain 2′-OMe
modifications, asymmetric phosphorothiate modification on the 3′
and 5′ ends, and a cholesterol tail which improves in vivo pharmacology and performance [7]. Still, antagomiRs are transient and
need to be continuously administered to maintain efficacy. Initial
studies of antisense DNA oligonucleotides used as inhibitors of
miRNA function showed that they were unstable and prone to
degradation [8].
LNA modifications are potent miRNA-inhibitors, having activity even at low doses [9–11]. Thus the exceptional binding of LNA
oligonucleotides make it possible to use shorter sequences that
only bind to the seed regions of target miRNAs [12]. This method

Generation of Tough Decoy Inhibitors

45

can be used to target a family of miRNA without having to account
for the 3′ sequence.
MicroRNA sponges are antisense inhibitors that competitively
bind to their target miRNA [13]. They have been observed to target whole miRNA families through complementarity to seed
sequences. These had eight RNA binding sites with perfect complementarity to their target miRNA which allows for specificity
[14]. The bulged sponge inhibitor introduces a bulge in the central region of the target site in addition to the eight miRNA recognition sites which decreases endonucleolytic target cleavage, thus
improving binding ability to its target mRNA [5].
Still limitations exist for current sponge inhibition models.
Increased number of binding sites has been shown to make bulged
sponge inhibitors more prone to deletion and mutation, making
them less stable [15, 16]. Additionally, low levels of miRNA inhibitors as stable transfectants make this inhibitor short-lived despite
initial effectivity.
1.3 Tough Decoy
Inhibitors

The tough decoy inhibitor is a 60 base pair long hairpin shaped
inhibitor with a large internal bulge containing two miRNA recognition sites [17]. Like the sponge inhibitor, tough decoy inhibitors
inhibit whole miRNA families through seed sequence base pairing
[5]. The bulge prevents it from endonucleolytic target [5].
Additionally, the double stranded structure is thought to cause
RISC mediated destabilization of the inhibitor to be impaired. The
initial design by Haraguchi et al. used a vector model designed to
be expressed with RNA Pol III. This method allowed for the
miRNA inhibitor constructed to be exported with exportin-5 easily because of the short 3′ overhang like that of miRNA. However,
tough decoy inhibitors can also be expressed with RNA Pol
II. Inhibitors expressed by Pol II maintained their inhibition capacity and had an added benefit of higher tissue specificity [5].
Furthermore, in comparison studies of inhibitors of miR-16
and miR-203, tough decoy inhibitors were shown to be the most
potent among antagomiR, stabilized antagomiR, tough decoy,
RISC-loaded shRNA, sponge, bulged sponge, and mask inhibition
methods [5]. This shows that despite only two recognition sites
existing, the use of tough decoy inhibitor is a highly effective
method. Furthermore, tough decoy variations can also improve
efficiency of tough decoy models. Clustered tough decoy, miRNA
inhibition increased efficiency of tough decoy models. Clustering
tough decoy inhibitors increases the number of recognition sites
and parallel suppression of miRNAs can be documented with single
molecules [18]. These suggest that families of miRNA can be suppressed through inhibition by a single clustered tough decoy model.
This inhibition method has been shown to be less effective
when adverse sterics caused by the secondary structure lead to
compromised functionality [5]. Furthermore, there has been an

46

Jimeen Yoo et al.

issue in which the two target sites of the tough decoy try to
mutually anneal to the targeted miRNAs, leading to a partial collapse of the structure, and thus decreasing efficacy of the tough
decoy [17]. However, more experimental evidence is needed to
understand the mechanistic differences of miRNA inhibitors to
determine designs that can be improved.
1.4 Tough Decoy
and Bulged Sponge
Inhibitor

2

Currently, two decoy type inhibition methods, bulged sponge and
tough decoy type inhibitors show the most potential as miRNA
inhibition methods. Depending on the miRNA, the two decoy
type inhibition methods are comparable in its efficiency. Studies
determining efficiency of these decoy inhibitors in five different
miRNAs shows that one was inhibited best by tough decoy, another
by the bulged sponge, and three found both equally effective [5].
This shows that inhibition mechanisms need to be sensitive to features of target recognition in which a single method is not a surefire mechanism of inhibition for all miRNA.
Tough decoy gene transfer using viral vectors is a widely used
method for creating miRNA inhibitors. Previously, sponge models
have been well described and constructed through methodologies
given by Kluiver et al. and Ebert et al. [14, 19]. These constructs
use tissue specific promoters in in vivo models. However, the lack
of a canonical protocol has made it difficult for tough decoy gene
transfer production. This methodology chapter aims to introduce
a simpler method for tough decoy inhibitor production and gene
transfer in various models that can be employed in future
experiments.

Methods

3.1 MiRNA Tough
Decoy Design
(See Note 2)

There are many designs and prototypes of tough decoy inhibitors but
currently the best construction for a single target miRNA is a two
stem structure with a single MBS structure linked by linkers (Fig. 3).
The other designs and prototypes have been shown to be effective in
other scenarios and are further explored by Haraguchi et al. [17].
The website below is useful to predict RNA folding and target site
accessibility: http://genie.weizmann.ac.il/pubs/mir07/ [21].
The MBS in the antisense sequence of the miRNA to be studied will contain a central mismatch in the center of the MBS. The
oligonucleotide can contain two of the same or different MBS
sequences. The bulge is created by designing non-complementation
between the central nucleotides. We then inserted three nucleotide
linkers between the stem sequence and MBS.

3.2 MiRNA Tough

3.3 Validation

3.4 In Vitro
Validation of Tough
Decoy Efficiency

Two cell types are tested for in vitro validation.
1. H9C2 cardiomyoblasts (see Note 3).
(a) Prepare H9C2 cells in 6 well culture plate 1 day before
transfection.
(b) Freshly extract pds-AAV2-target miR decoy plasmid and
pds-AAV2-scrambled plasmid (control) with the endotoxin free midi DNA Purification kit (Qiagen).
(c) Prepare at least three different concentrations to confirm
dose-dependent activity (e.g., 1, 2, and 4 μg).
(d) Transfect the cells with PEI reagent.
(e) Forty-eight hours later, harvest the cells and obtain protein lysates by RIPA buffer containing protein/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail.
2. H9C2 is notorious for its transfection efficiency. For this reason,
PEI solution is a superior alternative as a transfection reagent.
Protocol for the production of PEI transfection reagent is
described below. However, PEI is also toxic for the cell if overused
(recommended dose: 30 μl for 100 mm culture dish) (1E7 cells).

3.4.1 Protocol for PEI
Stock Solution

1. Pour ~200 ml of Milli-Q H2O into a 500 ml glass beaker.
2. Add 250 mg of PEI to the beaker with stirring.
3. Add concentrated HCl dropwise to the solution to pH = 1.9.
4. Stir at least 24 h until the PEI is completely dissolved. Maintain
the pH < 2.0 throughout (dissolution appears to occur in
30–40 min but is not, maintain stirring for 24 h). Approximately
400 μl of 12 M HCl will be required for full PEI dissolution.
There may still be some small fiber particles that will not
dissolve.
5. Neutralize by adding concentrated NaOH dropwise to the
solution pH 7.0.
6. Pour the solution into a 500 ml glass cylinder. Adjust the final
volume to 250 ml with Milli-Q H2O.
7. Filter-sterilize the solution through one 0.22-μm membrane.
8. Store aliquots of the desired volume at −80 °C.

3.4.2 Isolated Mouse
Adult Cardiomyocytes

Freshly isolate the mouse adult cardiomyocytes from a mouse on
the day of infection (see Note 4).
1. Inject heparin (50 U).
2. Anesthetize the

3. Quickly remove the heart from the chest and retrogradely perfuse the aorta at 37 °C for 3 min with calcium-free Tyrode
buffer gassed with 100 % O2.

Generation of Tough Decoy Inhibitors

51

4. Initiate the enzymatic digestion by adding collagenase type B
(300 U/ml; Worthington) and hyaluronidase (0.1 mg/ml;
Worthington) to the perfusion solution.
5. Quickly remove the left ventricle when the heart becomes
swollen after 10 min of digestion, cut into several chunks, and
further digest in a shaker (60–70 rpm) for 10 min at 37 °C in
the same enzyme solution.
6. Filter the cell suspension through a cell strainer and gently
centrifuge at 500 rpm for 1 min.
7. Plate the pellet containing myocyte fraction right after centrifugation to further remove non-myocyte fraction (mainly
fibroblasts).
8. Replate the cells on laminin coated culture dishes.
9. Infect isolated cells with purified AAV9-target miR decoy with
at least three different concentrations (i.e., 1E4 viral genome
(vg), 5E4 vg, and 1E5 vg per cell).
10. After 4 days, harvest cells and obtain RNAs using mirVana™
miRNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and extract
protein lysates by RIPA buffer containing protein/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail.
3.5 In Vivo Validation
of Tough Decoy
Efficiency

Inject AAV9 target miR decoy intraveneously through the tail vein.
After a 4 week incubation period of the virus, evaluate decoy function using Q-PCR and western blot analysis.
1. HF mouse is immobilized with a single mouse restrainer.
2. Inject AAV9 target miR decoy intravenously through the tail
vein.
3. House the mice for at least 4 weeks to allow sufficient transgene expression.
4. Euthanize the mice humanely and harvest different organs to
identify tissue specificity (e.g., heart, liver, kidney, lung, brain).
5. Extract DNAs to confirm genomic incorporation and obtain
RNAs and proteins from each tissue to perform Q-PCR and
western blot analysis.

Notes
1. Cloning for AAV vector
Usually U6 promoter is used to generate miRNA and
miRNA inhibitor, however, CMV promoter is also acceptable
and works similarly efficient as U6 promoter.
However, selection of the most optimal promoters depends
on the cell type of interest and the application.

2. Design Errors causing ineffective Tough Decoys
Design of a miRNA tough decoy inhibitor is the most critical step in tough decoy gene transfer. It depends on what
miRNA will be used and how the protein of interest should be
targeted. Additionally, an appropriate scrambled tough decoy
sequence also needs to be constructed to act as a negative
control (Refer to couple of previously published paper, [17]
and [19]).
3. Anesthetic agent usage for ECHO and PV loop
HF animals are very sensitive against all anesthetic reagents,
so start with a half dose of ordinary usage.
4. Myocyte isolation
Some genetically modified mice are very sensitive to collagenase concentration. Determine the working concentration
before use.
Also, following procedures are extremely critical for cell
viability.
(a) Suspend the heart on the Langendorff heart perfusion
system as soon as possible, ideally in less than 2 min.
(b) Oxidize all buffers thoroughly for 30 min prior to this
experiment.
(c) Keep the aorta intact when removing the heart in order to
thoroughly circulate the buffer through the coronary
artery to maximize the enzyme effect.
(d) Pipet minimally after enzyme digestion to prevent damage
to the cell (do not cut the tissue using a razor blade or
scissor).
(e) Plate the cell after cell filtration procedure using 2 %
bovine serum albumin (BSA) containing Tyrode buffer
and exchange it with normal growth medium 2 h later.

Efficient Genome Editing in Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells
with Engineered Nucleases In Vitro
Vittavat Termglinchan, Timon Seeger, Caressa Chen, Joseph C. Wu,
and Ioannis Karakikes
Abstract
Precision genome engineering is rapidly advancing the application of the induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) technology for in vitro disease modeling of cardiovascular diseases. Targeted genome editing using
engineered nucleases is a powerful tool that allows for reverse genetics, genome engineering, and targeted
transgene integration experiments to be performed in a precise and predictable manner. However,
nuclease-mediated homologous recombination is an inefficient process. Herein, we describe the development of an optimized method combining site-specific nucleases and the piggyBac transposon system for
“seamless” genome editing in pluripotent stem cells with high efficiency and fidelity in vitro.

Introduction
The advent of nuclease-mediated genome editing is a technological
breakthrough for targeted genetic modifications [1]. Programmable
nucleases generate double-strand breaks (DSBs) at precise loci, which
stimulate the endogenous repair machinery for either nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways. The error-prone NHEJ pathway generates random insertions or
deletions at the site of DSBs, while HDR employs homologous donor
DNA sequences to introduce genetic modifications. Both NHEJ
and HDR are utilized for different aspects of genome engineering:
NHEJ leads to targeted mutagenesis, whereas HDR allows for precise
gene insertions, corrections, deletions, or base substitutions.
To date, three major classes of programmable nucleases—zinc
finger nucleases (ZFNs) [2, 3], transcription activator-like effector
nucleases (TALENs) [4], and the clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9

inserted, mutations have been introduced and/or corrected in
human iPSC-based models of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) [7],

Methods

3.1 TALEN Design
and Construction

1. TALEN design: We recommend using the TALEN Targeter
tool to design TALENs (https://tale-nt.cac.cornell.edu/tutorials/talentargeterupdated). The TALEN cutting site should
be within 50 bp of the targeted mutation. Each TALEN binding site is 15 bp long with 13–18bp (16bp is optimal) between
the forward and reverse TALEN binding sites. The position 0
nucleotide (the nucleotide just 5′ to the first position of the
TALEN binding site) should be a T for both TALENs.
2. TALEN construction: We recommend using the protocol provided with the Musunuru/Cowan Lab TALEN Kit (http://
www.stembook.org/node/1438.html) to construct the TALEN
constructs.
3. TALEN vector sequencing primers:
TALEN_Fw: 5′-GGCCAGTTGCTGAAGATCG-3′
TALEN_Rv: 5′-CGCTACAAGATGATCATTAGTG-3′

3.2 CRISPR/Cas9
Design and
Construction

1. We recommend using the Feng Zhang’s lab CRISPR Design
tool to design the guide RNAs (gRNA) for either conventional
CRISPR/Cas9 or nickase CRISPR/Cas9 (http://crispr.mit.
edu). The CRISPR/Cas9 cutting site should be within 50 bp
of the target sequence.
2. We recommend using the protocol from the Fen Zhang’s lab
(http://www.genome-engineering.org/).
3. CRISPR/Cas9 sequencing primers:
U6_F: 5′-CAAGGCTGTTAGAGAGATAATTGGA-3′

3.3 Estimation
of Cleavage Efficiency

1. Day 0: Dissociate HEK293 cells with Accutase. Plate 80,000
cells per well in a 24-well plate in 0.5 mL growth media (90 %
DMEM with 10 % FBS) (see Note 1).
2. Day 1: Perform transfection. The passaged cells should be
25–30 % confluent after 24 h.
Prepare the transfection mix for 1 well of the 24-well plate.
In one tube add 1.5 μL of Turbofect Mix in 50 μL Opti-MEM.
In a separate tube resuspend the plasmid DNA in 50 μL OptiMEM as follows:

Genome Editing in iPSCs

59

(a) For TALENs or nickase CRISPR/Cas9 reaction: We recommend using 0.3 µg of each TALEN or nickase CRISPR/
Cas9 (total of 0.6 µg/pair).
(b) For conventional CRISPR/Cas9 reaction: We recommend
using 0.6 µg of the CRISPR/Cas9.
3. Mix the contents of the two tubes (100 μL total per transfection reaction) and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.
Next, gently add the transfection mix dropwise in one well.
4. Day 2: Replace media with fresh growth media. Check the
transfected cells under a fluorescent microscope for doublepositive (GFP+/RFP+) cells for the TALEN transfection, or
single-positive (GFP+) cells for the CRISPR/Cas9 transfection (see Note 2).
5. Day 3: Collect the transfected cells and extract the genomic
DNA.
6. Proceed to Subheading 3.4.

1. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to detect the TALEN
or CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage efficiency (Fig. 2; see Note 3).

Fig. 2 Surveyor assay for indel frequency analysis. Left panel: the cleavage efficiency of four CRISPR gRNAs
was tested by transfecting HEK293 cells with the expression plasmids for Cas9 and the indicated CRISPR
gRNA. The genomic DNA was extracted 48 h later and was subjected to the Surveyor assay and the cleavage
products were resolved by gel electrophoresis. The best gRNA for the targeted locus was defined as the gRNA
that resulted in the highest percentage of cleavage products. The cleavage efficiency of different gRNAs ranged
from 0 to 11 %. Right panel: Control G/C heteroduplex/homoduplex DNA (+) and Control G homoduplex DNA (−)
were digested in PCR buffer with 1 μL of Surveyor® Nuclease S. Surveyor Nuclease cleavage at the mismatches produces products of 217 and 416 bp. Digestion products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis on a
2.5 % agarose gel in 1× TBE buffer. Lane M: Marker DNA

3.5 HR Vector
Construct

1. Design: Download the genomic sequence starting from at least
1 kb upstream and ending with 1 kb downstream of the site to be
modified from a public database. We recommend using the RefSeq
annotation from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/).
2. Search for a TTAA sequence near the genomic region to be
modified. TTAA should be within 50–75 bp of the TALEN or
CRISPR/Cas9 cutting site. If a natural occurring TTAA
sequence is not available near the modification site, an artificial
TTAA sequence can be created by introducing a silent mutation (see Note 4).
3. Design the homology arms on either side of the TTAA site to
be around 500 bp in length. The 500 bp upstream of TTAA is
the 5′-end arm of the HR vector, and the 500 bp downstream
of TTAA is the 3′-end arm of the HR vector (Fig. 3).
4. Modify the DNA sequence in the homology arms to correct,
or introduce the desired genetic modification.
5. Optional: Additional silent mutations at the TALEN or
CRISPR/Cas9 binding site may be introduced in the HR
vector to prevent TALEN or CRISPR/Cas9 from cutting the
recombinant DNA vector (see Note 5).
6. Incorporate the appropriate sequences for the transposonspecific inverted terminal repeats (ITR) and the compatible
restriction sites to the end of the 5′-end and 3′-end homology
arms (Fig. 3; see Note 6).
7. We recommend using GeneArt™ Gene Synthesis (ThermoFisher)
to synthesize both homology arms (see Note 7).
8. Cloning: Set up restriction digests for the 5′-end insert, and
the piggyBac plasmid (NotI and BsiWI enzymes).
9. Purify the digested DNA insert with a column-based purification kit.

Fig. 3 Design the homology arms. The piggyBac Inverted Terminal Repeats (ITRs) each contain unique restriction sites (BsiWI and NsiI) near their ends, which can be used for cloning the homology arms. The homology
arms on either side of the TTAA site are approximately 500 bp in length. The 500 bp upstream of TTAA is the
5′-end arm of the HR vector, and the 500 bp downstream of TTAA is the 3′-end arm of the HR vector

Genome Editing in iPSCs

10. Run the piggyBac HR vector on a 1 % agarose gel, cut the vector
band (6 kb), and purify using column-based purification kit.
11. Perform DNA ligation. We recommend a plasmid to insert
ratio of 1:5 with 50 ng of the linearized plasmid.
12. Proceed with the transformation of the cloning reaction using
chemically competent E. coli cells. Follow the manufacturer’s
instructions.
13. Plate E. coli cells on ampicillin-containing agar plates. Incubate
overnight at 37 °C.
14. Pick 6–10 individual bacterial colonies and screen for successful ligations. Grow single clones in 2 mL growth medium
overnight at 37 °C. On the following day, isolate plasmid DNA
(Miniprep). To screen for the ligated insert, perform a restriction digestion (NotI and BsiWI enzymes). Run the digested
DNA on an agarose gel (1 %). A successfully ligated insert
should generate two bands, one corresponding to the vector
(6.0 kb) and one the size of the insert (~500 bp).
15. Verify the 5′-end arm of the plasmid by Sanger sequencing
(PB_F: 5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′).
16. Repeat steps 8–14 to clone in the 3′-end insert to the piggyBac
HR vector containing the 5′-end arm derived in step 15, using
the 3′-end arm-specific restriction enzymes (NsiI and AscI)
(see Note 8).
17. Verify the 3′-end arm of the plasmid by Sanger sequencing
(PB_R: 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′).
18. Prepare a maxiprep of the completed piggyBac HR vector.
19. Repeat Sanger sequencing to confirm that both HR vector
arms are correct.
3.6 iPSCs
Transfection

1. Day 0: Dissociate iPSCs with Accutase™ at 37 °C for 5 min,
and plate 3.30 × 105 cells per well in a 6-well plate with 2 mL
of E8 media containing 1 μM of ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632).
Incubate at 37 °C overnight.
2. Day 1: Replace media with fresh E8 media (1.75 mL/well). At
this stage, the cells should be 25–30 % confluent. Prepare the
transfection mix for 2 wells of a 6-well plate. First, mix 10 μL
of Lipofectamine 3000 in 250 μL of Opti-MEM in one tube.
In a separate tube, first mix 14 μL of P3000 reagent in 250 μL
of Opti-MEM, and then add the TALEN or CRISPR/Cas9
and HR vector as follows:
(a) For TALENs or nickase CRISPR/Cas9: 0.8 µg of each
TALEN or nickase CRISPR/Cas9 (total of 1.6 µg/pair)
and 5.4 µg of HR vector.
(b) For conventional CRISPR/Cas9: use 1.34 μg of CRISPR/
Cas9 with 5.66 μg of HR vector.

62

Vittavat Termglinchan et al.

3. Combine the contents of both tubes (500 μL total volume)
and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.
4. Add 250 μL of the transfection mix dropwise to the iPSCs in
each well of the 6-well plate.
5. Day 2: Aspirate the media and add fresh E8 media. Check the
transfected cells under a fluorescent microscope for doublepositive (GFP+/RFP+) cells for the TALEN transfection, or
single-positive (GFP+) cells for the CRISPR/Cas9 transfection (see Note 9).
6. Day 3: Passage the transfected iPSCs from each well using
Accutase™. Resuspend the iPSCs in 12 mL of E8 media containing 1 μM Y-27632, and plate in 6 wells of a new 6-well
coated with Matrigel (1:6 split).
7. Day 4: Begin changing E8 media every day.
8. Day 5: Start clone selection with puromycin at 0.10–0.25 μg/
mL for the MV-PGK-Puro-TK HR vector or G418 at
50–200 μg/mL for the MV-PGK-Neo-TK vector. Change
media every day (see Note 10).
9. Day 12: Individual colonies should appear after 6–8 days of
selection. Proceed to Subheading 3.7.
3.7 Isolation
of iPSC Clones

1. Pick individual iPSC clones with the assistance of a microscope,
and transfer each clone into a separate well of a 48-well plate
(Matrigel-coated) containing 250 μL of E8 media supplemented
with 1 μM Y-27632. We recommend picking 20–30 clones.
2. Collect the remaining cells from 1 to 2 wells and extract
genomic DNA (see Note 11).
3. Allow the cells to attach for 24–48 h and then add E8 media.
Feed the cells with fresh E8 media every other day (see Note 12).
4. After 7–10 days dissociate the cells with Gentle Cell Dissociation
Reagent for 6–7 min at room temperature. Gently aspirate and
add 300 μL of E8 media supplemented with 1 μM Y-27632.
5. Using the P1000 pipette, gently pipette 4–5 times to break
down the cell colonies. Transfer 150 μL of the cell suspension
into a new well of a 24-well plate. Add 350 μL E8 media in
each well and incubate at 37 °C. Extract genomic DNA from
the remaining cells (Qiagen, DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit).
6. For HR clones: proceed to Subheading 3.8. For transposonexcised clones: proceed to Subheading 3.10.

3.8

Junction PCR

1. Design the junction PCR primers to screen for putative
genome-editing iPSC clones using the genomic sequence
(Subheading 3.5). The primer-binding site should be 100–
200 bp outside of the homology arms. We have already
optimized several primers that bind inside the ITRs of the

Genome Editing in iPSCs

63

HR vector that can be combined with the sequence-specific
primers (see Note 11).
2. Using the genomic sequence, also design three primer pairs to
amplify the wild-type sequence (~300 bp upstream and downstream of the modification site).
3. Set up the junction PCR reactions for each clone by combining
the optimized primer pairs in separate reactions (see Note 11).
4. Identify putative targeted clones by amplification of both the
5′- and 3′-end homology arms. The targeted efficiency is variable (Fig. 4; see Note 13).
5. After identifying a putative clone, set up a separate PCR reaction using the wild-type primers (Fig. 4, see Note 14).
6. Verify the PCR amplified products by Sanger sequencing using
both the 5′- and 3′-end primers for sequencing.

7. After confirmation of a correctly targeted clone, expand the
clone and generate frozen stocks.
8. Proceed to Subheading 3.9.
3.9 Excision
of the HR Cassette

1. Day 0: After expanding the correctly targeted clone, dissociate
the cells using Accutase™ at 37 °C for 5 min, and resuspend
1 × 106 cells in 12 mL of E8 media supplemented with 1 μM
Y-27632. Plate the iPSCs in a new 6-well plate (2 mL/well;
~1.6 × 105 cells/well).
2. Day 1: Change media to E8 (1.75 mL/well). The passaged
cells should be 10–25 % confluent. Prepare the transfection
mix for 1 well of a 6-well plate. Combine 3.75 μL of
Lipofectamine® MessengerMAX™diluted in 125 μL of OptiMEM and 1 μg of excision only piggyBac™ transposase mRNA
diluted in 125 μL of Opti-MEM (total volume 250 μL). Gently
add the transfection mix (250 μL) to 1 well of the 6-well plate.
Final volume is 2 mL per well (see Note 15).
3. Day 2: Change media to fresh E8.
4. Day 3: Passage each of the transfected wells using Accutase™
into the 6-well plate with E8 media supplemented with 1 μM
Y-27632 (1:12 split).
5. Day 4: Change media to E8 media supplemented with ganciclovir (1–2 µM) or FIAU (0.1–0.2 µM) for the next 7–8 days
(see Note 16).
6. Day 12: Individual colonies should appear. Pick and expand
single clones as described in (Subheading 3.7).

3.10 Verification
of the Genome-Edited
Clones

1. Use the optimized PCR primer pairs (Subheading 3.8) to
amplify the homology arms (5′- and 3′-end primers) and wildtype genomic sequence (wild-type primers).
2. PCR products from the 5′- and 3′-ends should be absent in
putative clones that the HR cassette has been successfully
excised (Fig. 5; see Note 17).
3. Sequence the amplified PCR products using the wild-type
primers. The desired genomic modification and any silent
mutations should be detected.

3.11 Off-Target
Effects

1. Several methods can be used to predict potential off-target
genomic sites.
(a) Off-target effects in TALENs: We recommend using the
PROGNOS tool (http://bao.rice.edu/Research/Bio
informaticTools/prognos.html).
(b) Off-target in CRISPR/Cas9: We recommend using the
CRISPR Design tool (http://crispr.mit.edu).

the genome editing process.

Notes
1. Pre-coating the 24-well plate with 1 % gelatin will enhance the
attachment of HEK293.
2. Transfection of HEK293 cells is very efficient. The viability of
the cells should be >90 % and the transfection efficiency should
be >80 %.
3. Always include the positive and negative controls that are provided with the Surveyor kit (G/C control). The cleavage efficiency varies significanlty among site-specific endonucleases.
Choose one endonuclease pair with 5–40 % cleavage efficiency
as determined by the surveyor assay, and design the HR vector

66

Vittavat Termglinchan et al.

accordingly. Highly active endonucleases (>40 % cleavage efficiency) might be problematic and usually result in frequent
NHEJ events.
4. An artificial TTAA sequence can be created by searching for
two consecutive amino acids (see Table 1).
5. If possible, select a TTAA sequence within the spacer of the
TALEN pair or nickase CRISPR/Cas9 binding sites. For conventional CRISPR/Cas9, try to design so that TTAA is inside
the CRISPR gRNA. This will ensure that the endonucleases
will not cut the recombinant DNA vector without the need of
introducing any additional silent mutations.
6. The piggyBac Inverted Terminal Repeats (ITRs) each contain
unique restriction sites (BsiWI and NsiI) near their ends, which
can be used for cloning homology arms. These enzymes are
compatible with the MV-PGK-Puro-TK and MV-PGKNeo-TK vectors. Use these restriction enzymes when possible
(see Table 2).
7. If a Gene Synthesis service is not available, 5′- and 3′-end
inserts can be synthesized by PCR using human genomic DNA
as a template and cloning primers that contain compatible
restriction enzymes that incorporate the ITR sequences.
Subsequently, PCR products can be cloned into a TOPO vector (e.g., StrataClone™ Blunt PCR Cloning Kit), followed by
site-direct mutagenesis (e.g., QuikChange II Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit) to modify the sequences of interest.
8. If the restriction enzymes from the 3′-end insert can cut the
5′-end insert, the cloning of the 3′-end arm should be performed first.

9. The viability of the transfected cells should be more than 80 %
and the transfection efficiency should be 1–5 %.
10. Cells will start to die 48–72 h post-antibiotic selection. Increase
the concentration of cells if necessary. The majority of cells
should detach by day 5 post-selection, leaving behind 25–100
clones/well of a 6-well plate. Continue the antibiotic selection
for 7 days, and then change media back to E8 media.
11. There is no positive control to test the junction PCR primers.
The genomic DNA extracted from the transfected cells after antibiotic selection and clone picking is used as a template (~50 ng
DNA per reaction) to identify a suitable set of primers that
amplify the homology arms. The sequence-specific primers can
be combined with the following primers in separate reactions:
5′-end HR arm primers (Reverse):
(a) R1: 5′-CGTCAATTTTACGCATGATTATCTTTAAC3′
(b) R2: 5′-GACCGATAAAACACATGCGTCA-3′
(c) R3: 5′-AGACCGATAAAACACATGCGTCAA-3′
3′-end HR arm primers (Forward):
(a) F1: 5′-CGACGGATTCGCGCTATTTA-3′
(b) F2: 5′-GTCCTAAATGCACAGCGACG-3′
12. Individual iPSC clones may contain a fair amount of differentiation after picking. Generally, it is not necessary to remove
the differentiated cells prior to passaging. By splitting the cells
the overall culture health should improve throughout the early
passages. If not, manually pick the undifferentiating iPSC
colonies.
13. Although it is difficult to predict, the efficiency of HR ranges
from 1/4 to 1/48 of the selected clones. The efficiency is
affected mainly by the cutting efficiency of endonucleases and
the proximity of the HR vector arms to the cleavage site.
14. Often both alleles are targeted and subsequently cleaved by the
endonuclease. However, in most cases, the HR vector repairs
only one of the alleles. The other allele could be mutated
through the NHEJ process—these clones should be identified
and discarded.
15. Although the HR excision is a rare event, typically a single
transfection reaction is sufficient to successfully produce a few
transposon-excised clones. However, in some instances, the
process could be repeated to increase the chances of obtaining
a gene-edited iPSC clone.
16. Cells will start to die around 48–72 h post selection. Optimize
the concentration of ganciclovir (or FIAU) if cells survive.
The majority of cells should detach by day 5–7 post-selection, leaving around 1–20 clones/well of a 6-well plate.

68

Vittavat Termglinchan et al.

Continue selection for 7 days, and then change media back
to normal E8 media. Antibiotic selection of confluent cells is
inefficient; therefore, split the confluent cells once again, and
then start selection the following day.
17. The piggyBac excision efficiency ranges from 10 to 100 % after
selection.

Direct Cardiac Reprogramming as a Novel Therapeutic
Strategy for Treatment of Myocardial Infarction
Hong Ma, Li Wang, Jiandong Liu, and Li Qian
Abstract
Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) holds great promise as a novel
therapy for the treatment of heart failure, a common and morbid disease that is usually caused by irreversible loss of functional cardiomyocytes (CMs). Recently, we and others showed that in a murine model of
acute myocardial infarction, delivery of three transcription factors, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 converted
endogenous cardiac fibroblasts into functional iCMs. These iCMs integrated electrically and mechanically
with surrounding myocardium, resulting in a reduction in scar size and an improvement in heart function.
Our findings suggest that iCM reprogramming may be a means of regenerating functional CMs in vivo for
patients with heart disease. However, because relatively little is known about the factors that regulate iCM
reprogramming, the applicability of iCM reprogramming is currently limited to the experimental settings
in which it has been attempted. Specific hurdles include the relatively low conversion rate of iCMs and the
need for reprogramming to occur in the context of acute injury. Therefore, before this treatment can
become a viable therapy for human heart disease, the optimal condition for efficient iCM generation must
be determined. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for both in vitro and in vivo iCM generation that has
been optimized so far in our lab. We hope that this protocol will lay a foundation for future further
improvement of iCM generation and provide a platform for mechanistic studies.

Introduction
Heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the
developed world [1]. In the USA alone, more than 1.5 million
people experience an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) each year,
and there are five million AMI survivors who suffer from ischemic
cardiomyopathy [1]. Because cardiomyocytes (CMs) in the heart
have very limited regenerative potential in response to injury, loss
of CMs results in impaired pump function and heart failure. Existing
treatments are primarily pharmacological and device-based, and do
not address the fundamental problem of CM loss. Indeed, the
prevalence of cardiomyopathy is steadily increasing worldwide [1],

making the identification of novel and effective therapies for this
morbid disease an urgent problem in biomedical research.
Unlike the hearts of lower vertebrates [2], the adult human
heart has very limited regenerative potential [3, 4]. Although postnatal vertebrate CMs undergo a small amount of cellular renewal,
the rate of CM proliferation is very low [3, 5, 6]. One approach to
cardiac regeneration has focused on enhancing such proliferative
indices genetically or pharmacologically [7–12]. Although whether
the magnitude of the beneficial effects would be sufficient to compensate for the functional loss of damaged myocardium awaits
confirmation [13], stimulating CM to reenter cell cycle for regenerative purposes is still a vital approach for the treatment of heart
disease [7–12]. A second approach to cardiac regeneration has
been to derive new CMs for transfer into an injured heart [14–17].
These cells are typically differentiated from multipotent cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) or pluripotent stem cells including
both embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs). Although the poor cell survival, low maturation efficiency, limited cell–cell interaction, and functional integration of
engrafted cells are major hurdles that remain to be overcome [18,
19], efforts to make this a practical therapy are ongoing. A third
newly emerging approach to regenerate an injured heart is to
directly convert the resident cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) into functional iCMs, which is discussed in more detail below.
Cardiomyocytes comprise 75 % of myocardial mass, but they
account for only 30–40 % of the total number of cells in the heart.
The majority of the remaining cells are CFs, which are responsible
for homeostatic maintenance of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the
normal heart [20–22]. CFs also respond to ischemia and other
injurious stimuli to coordinate chemical and mechanical signals
between cellular components in the heart. Upon injury, CFs
migrate to the site of injury, proliferate, and contribute to scar formation through fibrosis [22, 23]. Thus, while the biological
importance of CFs has long been recognized, their potential as an
endogenous resource for cardiac regeneration has been largely
neglected until very recently.
Takahashi and Yamanaka’s seminal publication in 2006 [24]
demonstrating the creation of iPSCs has ushered in a new era of
utilizing cellular reprogramming in regenerative medicine. The
idea has been leveraged thus far to directly reprogram fibroblasts
into various cell types including pancreatic β-cells [25], blood progenitor cells [26], neurons [27, 28], hepatocytes [29, 30], and
CMs [31–36]. Ieda et al. first identified that a cocktail of three
cardiac transcription factors, Gata4, Tbx5, Mef2C (GMT), is sufficient to convert cultured neonatal and adult CFs into iCMs that
displayed most features of functional CMs [32]. More recently, we
showed that transduction of GMT can convert resident CFs into
iCMs in vivo in an acutely injured murine heart [35]. Furthermore,
this conversion resulted in a reduction in scar size and an

Protocol for iCM Generation

71

improvement in heart function [35]. Subsequently, similar combinations of transcription factors (Tbx5, Mef2c, and Myocardin [34]
or GMT plus Hand2 [36]) or microRNAs (miR-1,133,208,499)
[33] were used to successfully reprogram CFs into iCMs. The
potential of utilizing large pool of endogenous CFs to generate
functional iCMs points to an extremely promising avenue to regenerate damaged myocardium in patients. Moreover, this approach
circumvents some of the obstacles faced by other approaches
including the need to identify a large cellular source and the need
for efficient transplantation and integration within the area of
injured myocardium.
To further optimize the condition for iCM reprogramming, our
lab has recently studied the influence of stoichiometry of G,M,T on
iCM reprogramming [37]. We took advantage of the inherent features of the polycistronic system and generated a complete set of
polycistronic constructs to include all possible splicing orders of
G,M,T in a single mRNA. With this set of unique tools, we found
that varying protein stoichiometry of G,M,T resulted in significant
differences in iCM reprogramming efficiency and quality. Moreover,
we found the optimal stoichiometry to be a relative high level of
Mef2c protein expression and low levels of Gata4 and Tbx5 expression (encoded in MGT construct). By addition of an antibiotic
selection marker to the best combination MGT, we were able to
further enrich transduced fibroblasts with a homogenous gene
expression stoichiometry that resulted in an even higher efficiency in
generation of mature iCMs [37]. Furthermore, when delivered into
a murine infarcted heart, MGT construct resulted in an increased
iCM generation compared to using the traditional mix of separate
G,M,T viruses [38]. MGT single triplet introduction also led to a
further attenuation of cardiac dysfunction and reduction in scar size
[38]. Here we describe in details the step-by-step protocol of in vitro
and in vivo iCM reprogramming using both the traditional separate
G,M,T and our recently developed single triplet MGT system.

Methods

3.1 Generation
of Retroviruses

1. Clone coding regions of mouse Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5
respectively into pMXs based retroviral vector [32]. A single
polycistronic vector with optimal ratio of Mef2c, Gata4 and
Tbx5 significantly increased reprogramming efficiency both
in vitro and in vivo [37, 38]. pMXs-dsRed serves as an indicator for evaluation of transduction efficiency. All these vectors
can be requested from the lab of Dr. Li Qian.
2. Maintain Plat-E retroviral packaging cell line in culture
medium. Split Plat-E cell to 4 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish 1 day
before retroviral packaging (see Note 1).
3. The next day, change with fresh transfection medium at least
1 h prior to transfection. Transfect Plat-E cells with
Lipofectamine 2000 when the culture reaches ~80 % confluent. Set up the following two mixtures: (1) dilution of 10 μg

Protocol for iCM Generation

75

packaging vectors in 500 μL Opti-MEM Medium. (2) dilution
of 20 μL Lipofectamine 2000 in 500 μL Opti-MEM Medium.
Add vector dilution into diluted Lipofectamine 2000 reagent.
Mix transfection solution thoroughly by tapping and incubate
the mixture for 15 min at room temperature.
4. Add transfection mixture dropwise to the Plat-E cells. Mix it
well by moving the plate in back-and-forth and side-to-side
motion. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for overnight.
5. After 24 h, replace with fresh prewarmed culture medium
without blasticidin and puromycin. Harvest retrovirus containing supernatant at 48 h after transfection. Filter the supernatant with a 0.45 μm cellulose acetate filter (see Note 2).
6. For virus used for in vitro reprogramming, pellet the virus
through incubation with viral precipitation solution. Add
2 mL of the precipitation solution to every 8 mL viral supernatant. Mix gently and precipitate overnight. On the next day,
spin the mixture at 1500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Discard the
supernatant and spin again for another 5 min. Gently aspirate
the remaining medium. Add 100 μL cold DMEM to resuspend virus from one 10 cm dish. The retrovirus is ready for
use (see Note 3).
7. For virus used for in vivo delivery, pellet the virus through
ultracentrifugation. Briefly, transfer the retrovirus containing
solution to a Beckman centrifuge tube. Put the tubes into
buckets and use SW28 rotor to spin down the virus at
33,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 h. Remove the supernatant without
disturbing the viral pellet. Wash the pellets once with ice-cold
PBS, and combine pellets from 5 to 10 dishes for a higher
titer. Resuspend the retroviral pellets with 100 μL of cold
DMEM by gently pipetting up and down. Avoid any air
bubbles. Aliquot into 1.7 mL Eppendorf tubes and store them
at −80 °C.
8. Determine the copy number of the virus by using Retro-X
qRT-PCR titration kit.
9. Determine the infectious unit (IFU) of virus. Seed the
NIH3T3 cells at 3 × 104/well in 24-well plate. On the second
day, transduce the cells with dsRed retrovirus with 5–10-fold
serial dilution. After 48 h culture, analyze fluorescence by flow
cytometer to determine the infectious unit (IFU). Assume
that the fluorescent protein-retrovirus and nonfluorescent
protein-retrovirus, which are made in the same batch, have the
same viability. In other words, their ratio of IFU/copy number should be the same. Determine the IFU of nonfluorescent
protein-retrovirus.
10. Dilute the concentrated virus with DMEM into 1 × 1010 IFU/
mL for in vivo gene delivery (see Note 3).

3.2 Direct
Reprogramming
In Vitro

Methods of direct reprogramming in vitro described here provide
an easy and fast way for purposes of mechanistic studies, highthroughput screening, and potentially clinical applications. Induced
cardiomyocytes (iCMs) generated in vitro could be detected at
very early time point (d3 for GFP reporter expression and d14 for
sarcomeric gene expression). More importantly, those iCMs start
spontaneous contraction from 4 weeks and exhibit cardiomyocyteslike electrophysiological features around 6 weeks.

3.2.1 Generation
of Mouse Cardiac
Fibroblasts from Explant
Culture Method

1. Briefly clean neonatal αMHC (α-myosin heavy chain)-GFP
transgenic mouse (P1 to P2) with 75 % ethanol, followed by
decapitation. Make a horizontal incision from under one armpit to the other to dissect the heart out. Move one heart into
one well of 24-well plate containing ice cold PBS.
2. Check GFP expression in heart by fluorescent microscope.
Choose GFP positive hearts and pool them into a 10 cm dish.
3. Cut the hearts into small pieces less than 1 mm3 in size using
a sterile blade and/or scissors.
4. Transfer every 3–4 minced heart pieces in 2 mL mouse fibroblast (mFB) media to one 10 cm dish and incubate it at 37 °C
for 3 h. Add 8 mL mFB media to the settled tissues and continue to culture for 1 week. Change media every 3 days.
5. On day 7, dissociate the explant cells by incubating the cells
with 3 mL 0.05 % trypsin–EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min. Inactivate
trypsin by adding 5 mL mFB media, followed by gently detaching the cells with cell scraper. Collect cells and pass through
40 μm cell strainers to avoid contamination of heart tissue fragments, and then pellet cells by spinning at 200 × g for 5 min.
6. Wash cells once with MACS buffer and cells are ready for
sorting.

3.2.2 Generation
of Mouse Cardiac
Fibroblasts from Enzyme
Digestion Method

1. Pool GFP positive hearts into 10 cm dish containing 10 mL
ice cold PBS. Squeeze ventricles with sterile forceps to remove
blood and rinse once with ice-cold DPBS.
2. Trim the hearts to remove other tissues and fat. Cut the heart
into four loosely connected pieces.
3. Incubate the heart tissues (from 20 to 30 hearts) in 50 mL
Falcon tube with 15 mL warm 0.05 % trypsin–EDTA, and
incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.
4. Gently aspirate trypsin, and add 10 mL warm type II collagenase (0.5 mg/mL) in HBSS. Vortex the tube on vortexer for
1 min and incubate the tube in 37 °C water bath for 3–5 min.
Vortex again for 1 min and let the tissues settle down for 1 min.
Collect the supernatant into a new tube containing 10 mL
cold mFB medium. Repeat the procedure until all tissue is
digested (around 4–5 rounds). At this end, combine all the

Protocol for iCM Generation

77

collections and filter through 40 μm cell strainer to make single
cell suspension. Spin down at 200 × g for 5 min, wash once
with MACS buffer and finally resuspend in MACS buffer.
5. Optimal: lyse red blood cells. Resuspend cells with 1 mL RBC
lysis buffer (150 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, and 0.1 mM
EDTA), keep on ice for 1 min, then add 10 mL MACS buffer
and spin down at 200 × g for 5 min. Wash one more time with
MACS buffer.
3.2.3 Isolation
of Thy1.2+ Fibroblasts
by MACS (MagneticActivated Cell Sorting)

1. Count the viable cell number and add 10 μL Biotin antiThy1.2 antibody to every 1 × 107 cells in 90 μL MACS buffer.
Incubate the cells with antibody in a refrigerator (2–8 °C) for
30 min.
2. Wash cells once with 10 mL MACS buffer and pellet the cells
by spinning at 200 × g for 5 min.
3. Add 10 μL anti-Biotin microbeads to 90 μL MACS buffer and
use the mixture to resuspend the cells. Incubate the cells with
microbeads in a refrigerator (2–8 °C) for 30 min.
4. Wash cells once with 10 mL MACS buffer and centrifuge
again at 200 × g for 5 min. Then resuspend the cells in 2 mL
MACS buffer.
5. While washing the cells, set up a MACS Separator in hood.
Insert an LS column to the separator. Apply 3 mL MACS buffer to the column to equilibrate it. Pass the cell suspension
through the column, and then wash the column three times
with 2 mL MACS buffer each time. After that, take the column off the Separator, add 2 mL MACS buffer to the column,
and insert the plunge to flush out the beads-binding cells.
Pellet the cells by centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min. Resuspend
cells in FB media and they are ready for seeding.

3.2.4 Reprogram Mouse
Cardiac Fibroblasts In Vitro

1. Prepare 0.1 % gelatin coated 24-well plates. Seed cells into
plates at proper density. For fibroblasts generated from explant
culture method, the seeding cells density could be around
2–3 × 104 cells/well of 24-well plate. For fibroblasts generated
from enzyme digestion method, the cells density could be
around 4–5 × 104 cells/well of 24-well plate. Culture the cells
overnight in mFB media at 37 °C (see Note 4).
2. On day 0, change culture media to 0.5 mL pre-warmed iCM
media containing 4 μg/mL Polybrene. Add 10 μL retrovirus
to each well. Incubate cells with virus for 48 h (see Note 5).
3. On day 2, change virus containing media to 0.5 mL regular
iCM media. Change media every 2–3 days.
4. On day 3, change media to iCM media supplemented with
2 μg/mL puromycin for cells transduced with pMx-puro-MGT
viruses. Keep it for 3 days. After that, maintain puromycin in

78

Hong Ma et al.

the iCM medium at the concentration of 1 μg/mL for additional 7 days.
5. On day 14, change iCM media to B27 media. Change media
every 3 days. Spontaneous beating cell loci may be observed
from 3 (cells from enzyme digestion method) or 4 (cells from
explant culture method) weeks after viral transduction.
3.2.5 Evaluation
of Cardiac
Reprogramming In Vitro:
Immunocytochemistry
(ICC)

1. Cardiac fibroblasts have been isolated from aMHC-GFP transgenic mice where the GFP expression is driven by
cardiomyocytes-specific aMHC promoter. This allows the
tracking of cells that have been converted from fibroblasts
(GFP negative) to iCMs (GFP positive). GFP expression could
be monitored under microscope 3 days after viral transduction. Cardiac structure genes, like cardiac troponin T (cTnT)
and α-actinin exhibit expression from 1 week and sarcomere
structures would appear around 2 weeks.
2. To visualize sarcomere structures in reprogrammed cells, stain
the cells with antibodies targeting GFP and cTnT. Prepare the
cells by washing three times with ice cold PBS. Fix them with
4 % paraformaldehyde/PBS at room temperature for
15–20 min. Wash cells twice with PBS and permeabilized the
cells with 0.1 % Triton/PBS, followed by washing twice and
blocking for 0.5–1 h with 5 % BSA/PBS. Then incubate the
cells with primary antibodies, anti-GFP and anti-cTnT, in 1 %
BSA/PBS overnight at 4 °C.
3. On the second day, probe the cells with secondary antibodies,
Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG for GFP
and Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG for
cTnT. Finally, stain the nuclei with DAPI.
4. Place the plate on EVOS FL Auto imaging system and capture
images through the EVOS software. Quantification would be
performed by counting GFP+ and/or cTnT+ cell number
(reprogrammed cell population) and DAPI+ cell number
(total cells) in each field. Reprogramming efficiency is calculated by dividing number of total cells with that of reprogrammed cells.

3.2.6 Evaluation
of Cardiac Reprogramming
In Vitro: Flow Cytometry
(FACS)

1. Dissociate the cells with 0.05 % trypsin–EDTA and 96-well
deep well plate well to well. Spin at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C
to pellet the cells.
2. Resuspend cells with 100 μL fixation/permeabilization buffer.
Treat the cells for 20 min at 4 °C.
3. Wash cell twice with 500 μL 1× wash solution, pellet, and
remove supernatant. Thoroughly resuspend each sample with
50 μL primary antibody solution (anti-GFP and anti-cTnT
antibodies) and incubate at 4 °C for 30 min.

4. Wash cells once and incubate each sample with 50 μL secondary antibody solution at 4 °C for 30 min.
5. Wash cells once in 1× wash solution. Resuspend cells in 400 μL
fixation buffer (DPBS with 1 % PFA). Transfer cell into FACS
tube with cell strainer cap. Samples are ready for FACS
detection.
3.2.7 Evaluation
of Cardiac Reprogramming
In Vitro: Gene Regulation

1. Lyse cells in TRIzol according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Either freeze the lysate at −80 °C or proceed immediately to
RNA purification.
2. Add 0.2 mL of chloroform, cap sample tubes securely. Shake
tube vigorously by hand for 15 s and incubate at RT for
2–3 min.
3. Centrifuge the samples at no more than 12,000 × g for 15 min
at 4 °C (now the mixture separates into three phases, the
upper aqueous phase contains RNAl).
4. Transfer the aqueous phase to a fresh tube and precipitate the
RNA by mixing with 0.5 mL of isopropyl alcohol.
5. Incubate samples at RT for 10 min and centrifuge at no more
than 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.
6. Remove supernatant, wash RNA pellet with 1 mL of 75 % ethanol, mix the sample by vortexing and centrifuge at no more
than 7500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C (keep it at −20 °C until use).
7. Briefly dry the RNA pellet, dissolve RNA in RNase-free water
and incubate for 10 min at 55–60 °C. RNA can also be redissolved in 100 % formamide (deionized) and stored at −70 °C.
8. Prepare cDNA using First Strand cDNA synthesis kit according to manufacturer’s recommendations.
9. Assess for gene expression using SYBR Green Real-Time PCR
Master Mixes together with designed primers. Genes involved
in sarcomere structures (Myh6, Myh7, Tnnt2, and Actc1),
ion channels (Pln, Slc8a1, and Scn5a), and cell junctions
(Gja1, Kcna5, and Cacba1c) could be evaluated. Successful
cardiac reprogramming shows significant upregulation of
those genes and downregulation of genes represent as fibroblast markers including Col1a1 and Col3a1. GAPDH expression should be detected simultaneously as a housekeeping
gene for normalization.

3.2.8 Evaluation
of Cardiac Reprogramming
In Vitro: Ca2+ Oscillation
at 4 Weeks

1. Calcium oscillation signals could be detected by using Rhod-3
Calcium Imaging Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reconstitute Rhod-3 in 100 μL of DMSO to yield a
stock solution of 10 mM Rhod-3. Store the stock solution
desiccated at −20 °C and protected from light in single use
aliquots.

80

Hong Ma et al.

2. Reconstitute Probenecid in 1 mL of HBSS to prepare 250 mM
stock.
3. Wash cells twice with HBSS buffer.
4. Prepare fresh loading buffer containing Rhod-3 and
Probenecid. Add loading buffer to cells immediately and incubate cells in dark at room temperature for 30–60 min.
5. Wash cells twice with HBSS.
6. Add 2 mL incubation buffer (2.5 mM probenecid in HBSS)
to cells and incubate cells in dark at RT for 30–60 min.
7. Wash cells once with HBSS. Cells are now ready for live-cell
imaging (see Note 6).
3.3 Direct
Reprogramming
In Vivo

Direct cardiac reprogramming opens a new avenue for cardiac
regeneration and disease modeling. Establishment of an efficient
in vivo reprogramming system would be beneficial for in vivo
mechanistic studies and ultimately moving this field further toward
clinical applications.

3.3.1 Mouse Myocardial
Infarction Model
and Delivery
of Reprogramming Factors

1. Anesthetize mice with 100 mg/kg ketamine plus 10 mg/kg
xylazine. Place mice in a supine position on a heating pad at
37 °C.
2. Intubate mice with a 19 G stump needle connected to a
MiniVent Type 845 mouse ventilator. Ventilate with 150 μL
of stroke volume at 120 breaths per minute. Ventilation is
confirmed by chest movement.
3. Perform anterior thoracotomy by cutting the third rib. Open
the chest with a Mini-Goldstein retractor. Remove the pericardium and expose the heart (see Note 7).
4. Ligate the left anterior descending artery (LAD) with an 8-0
prolene suture. The ischemia is confirmed by myocardial
blanching (see Note 8).
5. Mix 10 μL retroviral solution (1 × 108 IFU virus) containing a
pooled viruses (Gata4/Mef2c/Tbx5) or a polycistronic MGT
virus or a dsRed virus with 10 μL of PBS plus 4 μg/mL polybrene. Inject the mixture into the myocardium through a
50 μL micro syringe incorporated with 33 G injection needle.
Single injection with a full dosage is employed along the
boundary between the infarct area and border zone based on
the blanched infarct area after LAD ligation (see Note 9).
6. After injection, the chest is closed by suturing muscle layer and
skin layer separately with a 6-0 Prolene suture. Let the mouse
recover with ventilation on the heating pad.
7. Sham-operated animals will be served as surgical controls and
will be subjected to the same procedures as the experimental
animals with the exception that the LAD is not ligated.

Protocol for iCM Generation
3.3.2 Evaluation
of In Vivo Viral Transduction
Efficiency

81

1. Two days after surgery, use cryosection and immunofluorescent staining to visualize transduction. Isolate all the cells from
left ventricle and run FACS to quantify transduction
efficiency.
2. Anesthetize mice subjected to MI and dsRed virus injection with
100 mg/kg ketamine plus 10 mg/kg xylazine (see Note 10).
3. For immunohistochemistry (IHC) on cryosections, open chest
to expose the heart. Inject 0.5 mL cardioplegia buffer into left
ventricle slowly. Perfuse the heart with 5 mL PBS slowly to
remove all the red blood cells. Perfuse the heart with cryosection buffer, then remove the heart and put it into 15 mL conical centrifuge tube containing 10 mL fresh cryosection buffer.
Incubate with gentle agitation at 4 °C overnight.
4. On the second day, wash the PFA away from the tissue with a
serial dilution of sucrose (5 %, 10 %, and 20 % respectively).
Embed the tissue with OCT and freeze in liquid nitrogen.
5. Block sections in Universal Blocking Buffer for 10 min, then
stain with RFP primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.
After washing with PBST for three times, incubate section
with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature followed
by washing another three times with PBST. Finally, mount the
section with Vectashield with DAPI. Most of dsRed+ cells
should present in MI border zone.
6. For FACS, left ventricular cells are isolated after removing
heart from chest. Cannulate the heart via aorta and perfuse
retrograde with Wittenberg Isolation Medium in a Langendorf
apparatus with a constant flow of 3 mL/min at 37 °C for
5 min. Then switch to digestion medium for another 10 min.
Dissect left ventricle and mechanically dissociate all the cells.
Fix and incubate the cells for RFP/Thy1 staining with BD
Cytofix/Cytoperm Solution Kit. Resuspend the cells with Fix
buffer and run FACS. Around 4 % or even more of cells from
the left ventricle should be dsRed+ Thy1+, depending on the
viral quantity, quality, and delivery (see Note 11).

3.3.3 Lineage
Tracing of In Vivo
Reprogrammed iCMs

1. To explore the mechanisms underlying in vivo direct reprogramming, it is critical to trace the lineage of induced cardiomyocyte (iCM) and characterize the iCM based on their
origin.
2. Cross periostin-Cre mice or Fsp1-Cre mice and R26R-lacZ
mice to obtain Periostin-Cre:R26R-lacZ or Fsp1-Cre:R26RlacZ mice to trace the fibroblast-origin iCMs using IHC.
3. To evaluate in vivo reprogramming quality and quantity,
cohorts of mice (10–12 mice per group) are sacrificed at 4, 8,
and 12 weeks after G/M/T or MGT delivery. Hearts are
perfusion-fixed and taken out to be further fixed in 4 % PFA or

82

Hong Ma et al.

0.5 % PFA for paraffin sections or cryo-sections respectively.
Cryosections are used for IHC of cardiac markers αActinin,
cTnT, Tropomyocin, αMHC, Connexin43, N-Cadherin, and
fibroblast lineage markers Periostin-Cre/Fsp1-Cre; RosaEYFP
(anti-GFP) to evaluate the conversion of CFs into iCMs (also
see Subheading 3.3.6). Paraffin sections are used to determine
the scar area using standard Masson-Trichrome staining
(Subheading 3.3.4).
4. Cross periostin-Cre mice and R26R-EYFP or R26R-Tomato
mice to get Periostin-Cre:R26R-EYFP or Periostin-Cre:R26RTomato mice for the following assays such as determining the
electrophysiological features (Subheading 3.3.6) and gene
expression of iCMs (Subheading 3.3.7) based on EYFP or
Tomato labeling.
3.3.4 Evaluation
of In Vivo Direct
Reprogramming:
Determination of Scar Size

1. To evaluate the consistence among different groups, Evans
blue/triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) double staining is
analyzed 48 h after MI. After anesthetizing and sacrificing
the mice, perfuse the hearts retrograde with 2 % Evans blue
via aorta. All the heart tissue shows in blue except for the area
at risk (AAR). Cut left ventricle into several slices with heart
matrices for tissue sampling. Incubate the slices in 1.5 % TTC
for 30 min at 37 °C. Fix with 4 % PFA overnight at 4 °C. The
infarcted area shows in white, while viable myocardium is in
red. Analyze infarct size/AAR size via planimetry with ImageJ
software.
2. To determine the scar size, standard Masson-Trichrome staining is applied on hearts 8 weeks after MI. Use ImageJ software
to measure the scar area (blue) and viable area (red) on a serial
of transverse sections with the first level right below the
ligation.

3.3.5 Evaluation
of In Vivo Direct
Reprogramming: Cardiac
Function

1. Echocardiography, hemodynamics, and MRI are analyzed to
evaluate the cardiac function at different time points (4, 8, and
12 weeks) after MI with or without delivery of reprogramming factors.
2. Perform echocardiography on anesthetized mice under
1–1.5 % isoflurane at a core temperature of ~37 °C with echocardiography machine and probes for mice. Capture parasternal long-axis and short-axis views of left ventricle at a frame
rate of 400 Hz. Obtain end-systole or end-diastole defined as
the phase in which the smallest or largest area of LV, respectively for ejection fraction assessment. Measure left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD) and left ventricular
end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) from the LV M-mode tracing at the papillary muscle level.

Protocol for iCM Generation

83

3. Perform hemodynamic assessment by inserting a mouse pressure catheter into the aorta and LV through the right common carotid artery on anesthetized mice under 1–1.5 %
isoflurane. Connect the transducer to Powerlab system to
record heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), left ventricular
systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end diastolic pressure
(LVEDP), left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), +dp/
dt and −dp/dt.
4. Perform MRI by a Varian DirectDrive 7 T small-animal scanner on the mice under anaesthetization by inhalation of 2 %
isoflurane/98 % oxygen administered. Insert two ECG leads
into the right front and left rear leg for image triggering. After
defining the oblique plane of the short axis, use an ECGtriggered two-dimensional gradient echo sequence with an
echo time of 2.75 ms, repetition time of 200 ms and a flip
angle of 45 °C to obtain nine short-axis images at 12 or 13
phases per cardiac cycle. Each scan consists of 8–9 contiguous
slices spanning the left ventricle from apex to base with 1-mm
thickness, a matrix size of 128 × 128, a field of view of
25.6 × 25.6 mm, and four averages.
3.3.6 Evaluation
of In Vivo Direct
Reprogramming:
Electrophysiology

1. Evaluate the electrophysiology and incorporation of iCMs by
miniature telemetry, cell coupling, Ca2+ handling/Stimulation,
and action potential after direct reprogramming.
2. One of the concerns for cardiac cell therapy is that the cardiomyocyte from exogenous transplant may not incorporate well
with the native myocardium, which leads to a potential risk of
arrhythmia. To test if direct reprogramming leads to the same
concern, ECGs are monitored over the course of iCM conversion. Three days after surgery for a full recovery, implant a
miniature telemetry in the abdominal cavity of the mouse.
Place and fix two leads to the muscle layer of the neck and
xiphoid respectively. Use Dataquest Software to acquire and
analyze the ECG data.
3. To determine if iCMs express proteins involved in cell–cell
communication, perfuse and fix hearts with 0.5 % PFA for frozen section as described in Subheading 3.3.3. After blocking
with universal blocking buffer, stain with primary antibody
against Connexin43 or N-cadherin or other gap junction proteins with β-galactosidase antibody to localize iCMs.
4. To assess the functional cell–cell junctions, measure the intercellular transmission of excitable Ca2+ wave and molecular
probes of gap junctional communication by isolating small
groups of cells from infarct/border zone, including tomatolabeling iCMs and nonfluorescent CMs. For doing this,
shorten the isolation time from 10 to 4 min as described in
Subheading 3.3.4.

84

Hong Ma et al.

5. After isolating myocytes, transfer them to a superfusion chamber. Incubated with 2 mM ouabain for 5–10 min to induce a
intracellular Ca2+ overload. Then, a Ca2+ wave activity is
revealed under the videomicroscopy.
6. The whole-cell patch-clamp method is used to assess the interconnectivity between iCMs and endogenous CMs. Add a dye
pair, 1 mM immobile dextran-conjugated Cascade Blue (MW
10,000) and 5 mM mobile calcein, in standard intracellular
solution with 5 mM EGTA, which help to reseal the sarcolemma of the cell receiving molecular dye, for 2 min cytoplasmic loading. Excite blue fluorescence from the immobile
indicator at 365 ± 40 nm, and calcein fluorescence at
470 ± 40 nm. Record fluorescent images using IonOptix
Myocam-S via a video frame grabber and process imaging with
ImageJ software.
7. Prepare the loading solution. Dissolve Fluo-4 in anhydrous
DMSO to 5 mM. Mix Fluo-4/DMSO with PowerLoad
Concentrate at 1:10. Dilute Fluo-4/DMSO/PowerLoad
1:100 in Tyrode’s solution to get a final loading solution for
myocytes.
8. Transfer isolated myocytes in loading solution for 30 min at
room temperature. Load the cells to a superfusion chamber
and de-esterificate for another 20 min. Evoke contraction and
Ca2+ transient by pulses of stimuli at 0.33 Hz of frequency,
2 ms of duration and 150 % of threshold voltage. Record Ca2+
transients in batches of ten, averaged numbers are used for
statistical analyses. Record resting fluorescence after cessation
of pacing, and obtain background light after removing the
cells from the field of view at the end of the experiment.
Calibrate the Ca2+ transients using the pseudo-ratio method,
assuming an in situ dissociation constant of 1.1 μM for Fluo-4.
Record contractions optically simultaneously with Ca2+ transients by illuminating the cell of interest in red light (>665 nm)
subsequently directed to a CCD camera. Convert the cell
length signals to voltage via a video motion detector.
3.3.7 Evaluation
of In Vivo Direct
Reprogramming: Gene
Regulation

1. As described in Subheading 3.3.4, isolate iCMs from different
regions and time points after MI by digestion and FACS (or
manual picking if the iCMs are large). Lysate the cells in
TRIzol or RIPA buffer to harvest RNA or protein according
to manufacturer’s recommendations. Prepare cDNA with
SuperScript III First-Strand synthesis kit. Assess the gene
expression using Taqman system or run western blot to determine protein expression.
2. As described in Subheading 3.3.3, prepare cryosection and
evaluate the protein expression of a battery of cardiac or fibroblast markers via immunohistochemistry.

Notes
1. Plat-E should be maintained under antibiotics (puromycin
and blasticidin) selection. Plat-E of fewer passages (<30 passages) is highly recommended for viral production. The cells
need to be about 70–80 % confluent when starting transfection to produce an efficient packaging.
2. The quality and quantity of retrovirus are both critical for
direct reprogramming. If most (>80 %) of the control dsRedtransfected Plat-E cells are red, collect all viral particles.
Otherwise, improve the transfection first. Usually the best
titer and viable virus can achieve at 48 h after transfection.
Some other transfection reagents, such as Nanofect, could also
be used to produce virus according to manufactures’
indications.
3. Excessive or sufficient virus can reduce the efficiency of reprogramming [39]. All retroviruses should be used freshly and
avoid multiple freeze–thaw cycles. A titration is recommended
right before viral delivery to ensure there is enough viable
virus.
4. The quality and purity of fibroblasts are extremely important.
MACS protocol we described here provides a gentle and convenient way to isolate fibroblasts of high-purity and highviability. The seeding density is also important. Density either
too high or too low results in a low percentage of iCMs. If
cells are sparsely seeded, they tend to become unhealthy with
irregular cell morphology and in large size. It is difficult to
convert those senescent-like cells into iCMs. If cells are seeded
too densely, the MOI (multiplicity of infection) for viral infection is decreased. Overgrowth of uninfected fibroblasts significantly dilutes the reprogramming events.
5. The amount of virus should be proportionally increased with
increased cell number in different culture plates or dishes. We
noticed that co-infection of MGT virus with another pMXs
vector based retrovirus will decrease the reprogramming efficiency, which possibly results from the fact that cells preferentially uptake more virus of smaller size than MGT virus. If
experiments of overexpression or knockdown some genes are
needed for reprogramming, we highly recommend using lentivirus for transduction. In this condition, do MGT infections for
24 h, add the lentivirus directly to MGT-containing media, and
incubate cells with both MGT and lentivirus for another 24 h.
6. Rhod-3 staining has a high background. Signals start to
decrease half hour after final step of washing, especially if incubated at 37 °C. We recommend imaging cells immediately and
finish the experiments within an hour.

86

Hong Ma et al.

7. The incision is usually performed in the third intercostal space
to avoid extra tissue damage in LAD ligation induced MI
model. Instead, we perform the surgery by cutting the third
rib which will give a better view for the following viral delivery
and is easier to operate [35, 38].
8. The size of infarct region depends on the ligation site. It is
important for the evaluation of cardiac function to keep the
LAD ligation procedure consistent among mice, which is
determined in Subheading 3.3.4.
9. The virus is delivered by a single shot along the margin of
infarcted area. Make sure the needle isn’t advanced into the
left ventricle, causing the viral leakage. The viral solution is
being injected while the syringe is withdrawn. When injection
finishes, hold the syringe in place for a while to let the viral
solution diffuse. Also, a concentrated viral solution is used
here to minimize the volume of injection.
10. Retrovirus only infect dividing cells, which are mainly the activated cardiac fibroblasts bordering the infarct zone. Most of
adult cardiac fibroblasts are regarded as quiescent cells.
Therefore infarcted hearts with dsRed infection are used as
negative controls.
11. Single cell CM/iCM isolation and the following assays are
used to rule out the false positives from overlaying cells.

Production and Characterization of Vectors Based
on the Cardiotropic AAV Serotype 9
Erik Kohlbrenner and Thomas Weber
Abstract
Vectors based on adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) efficiently transduce cardiomyocytes in both
rodents and large animal models upon either systemic or regional vector delivery. In this chapter, we
describe the most widely used production and purification method of AAV9. This production approach
does not depend on the use of a helpervirus but instead on transient transfection of HEK293T cells with
a plasmid containing the recombinant AAV genome and a second plasmid encoding the AAV9 capsid
proteins, the AAV Rep proteins and the adenoviral helper functions. The recombinant AAV is then purified
by iodixanol density gradient centrifugation. This chapter also describes in detail the characterization and
quality control methods required for assuring high quality vector preparations, which is of particular
importance for experiments in large animal models.

Introduction
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a small, non-enveloped virus with
a single-stranded DNA genome that is flanked by two inverted
terminal repeats (ITRs). It has originally been isolated from an
adenoviral preparation [1] and is a “defective” virus in the sense
that it requires co-infection with a helpervirus, such as adenovirus
or herpesvirus, for productive replication [1].
In part due to its nonpathogenic nature, its limited immunogenicity and its ability to trigger long-term gene expression in
postmitotic tissues, even in the absence of genome integration,
AAV has been recognized as one of the most promising gene delivery vehicles. Not only has it often become the tool of choice in
preclinical animal models, but as of June 2015, 117 clinical trials
using AAV have either been completed or are in progress. Moreover,
in 2012, treatment of lipoprotein-lipase deficiency has been

approved for clinical use in Europe, the first approval of a gene
therapeutic treatment in the Western World [2].
The collection of AAV serotypes and variants show broad but
distinct tissue and cell tropism. For cardiac gene delivery, the AAV
serotype 9 (AAV9) has clearly emerged as the most potent serotype, at least in rodents, when delivered systemically [3] and in pigs
(personal communication: Dr. Roger Hajjar, Icahn School of
Medicine) and possibly in dogs [4, 5] when delivered regionally.
In this chapter, we describe the production and detailed characterization of AAV9 vectors at a scale that is sufficient for both
small and large animal experiments.
The AAV vector genome consists of two genes, the Rep gene,
which encodes for the Rep proteins, which are involved in DNA
replication and encapsidation of the viral DNA into preformed
capsids. The viral capsid is composed of 60 copies of the capsid
proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 that are encoded by the Cap gene.
Using an alternative reading frame, the Cap gene also encodes the
so-called assembly-activating protein (AAP), which facilitates capsid assembly [6].
For recombinant AAV (rAAV) production, the ITRs are the
only cis elements required, whereas the Rep proteins, the serotypespecific capsid proteins, AAP and all the helpervirus functions can
be provided in trans. One of the drawbacks of AAV is its limited
packaging capacity of ~5 kb. But for most applications this is not
an issue because the median size of human proteins is 375 amino
acids [7].
For small to medium scale AAV production (1012–1013 vector
genome containing particles), AAV is generally produced by transfection of HEK293 cells. The plasmids used are a so-called cisplasmid, which contains the transgene (or elements regulating host
gene expression, e.g., shRNAs) flanked by the ITRs, and plasmids
encoding Rep, Cap, AAP and the necessary (most often adenoviral) helpervirus proteins [8]. In its simplest form, which is the
method preferred in our laboratory, Rep, Cap, AAP, and all the
adenoviral helper functions are provided on a single plasmid [9].
For AAV9, the virus is harvested 72 h post-transfection from
both the cell culture medium as well as the transfected cells. In our
laboratory, and many others, the virus is then purified by Iodixanol
gradient centrifugation.
Whereas many laboratories only characterize their virus by
determining viral titers by qPCR, our experience is that, especially
for large animal studies, a more thorough virus characterization
that includes SDS-PAGE (to determine virus purity and total viral
capsid titers), qPCR (to determine viral genome titers), alkaline
agarose gel electrophoresis (to ensure genome integrity and/or
viral genome titer) and negative-staining electron microscopy (to
determine the percentage of empty particles) is warranted.

Methods

3.1 Plasmid Cloning
and Production

1. To prevent the potential loss of intact ITRs all our cis plasmids
are cloned and maintained in either SURE2 or Stbl3 cells and
grown at 30–32 °C (see Note 4). pDG9 can be maintained in a
regular E. coli strain such as DH5α and can be grown at
37 °C. We routinely purify our plasmids with QIAFilter Plasmid
Maxi Kit. For the production of the cis plasmid, one 2 l
Erlenmeyer flask with 600 ml Luria–Bertani medium should
produce enough plasmid for ten triple flasks. Since the amount
of pDG9 needed for the same number of triple flasks is three
times the amount of the cis plasmid, we grow the bacterial cultures in three 2 l flasks with 600 ml Luria-Bertani medium each.
2. To confirm that the majority of the cis-plasmid contains two
intact ITRs we digest the cis plasmid with SmaI (or XmaI)
restriction enzyme and analyze the digested DNA on an agarose gel.

3.2 Cell Maintenance
(See Note 5)

1. HEK293T are maintained in DMEM supplemented with
10 % FBS and 1× Penicillin/Streptomycin (“medium”) for
all growth and passaging steps unless otherwise noted.

96

Erik Kohlbrenner and Thomas Weber

For continuous culture, the cells are grown to approximately
70–80 % confluency and then split 1:10 or 1:20 to be ready to
be split again 3 days or 4 days later, respectively.
2. To split cells from a 225 cm2 flask, gently remove the culture
medium, add 20 ml PBS without Mg/Ca to cover the surface
and gently rock the flask to completely cover the cells. Remove
the PBS and add 5 ml 0.025 % Trypsin to the side of the flask,
not directly onto the cells. Spread over the cells by gently
“rocking” the flask several times. Incubate at 37 °C for
1–2 min. Then rock the flask to completely dislodge the cells.
Pipet 25 ml media onto the cells and pipet up and down to
prepare a homogenous cell suspension. Add 50 ml of a 1:10 or
1:20 dilution of cell suspension in fresh medium to a new flask
(see also Note 6).
3.3

Transfection

1. To prepare the PEI solution for transfection add 250 mg PEI
powder to 200 ml sterile, deionized water and stir with magnetic stir bar. Adjust pH to 1.9 by addition of 10 N hydrochloric acid. Stir overnight to assure complete dissolution of the
PEI. The next day, add dropwise 1 N sodium hydroxide to
adjust the pH to 4.5. Then add water to 250 ml and sterile
filter with a 0.22 μm filter bottle. Store aliquots at −80 °C. Once
thawed, the solutions can be stored at 4 °C for up to 2 months.
2. The day before transfection, detach cells with Trypsin and split
either ~1:4 or 1:6 (see Note 7) into triple flasks. One confluent
225 cm2 flask is sufficient to seed two triple flasks (total area
1000 cm2) at a 1:4 dilution. Prior to seeding the triple flasks,
remove a sufficient amount of cells to seed a 225 cm2 flask for
the continuation of cell passaging.
3. The morning after seeding the triple flasks, check the flasks for
cell confluency. If ~70 % confluent, proceed to transfection
immediately. If the confluency is less than ~70 %, perform the
transfection later in the day.
4. For each triple flask to be transfected, warm 90 ml DMEM
(2 % FBS, 1× Pen/Strep) to 37 °C.
5. Prepare the transfection mix by adding in the following order
to 20 ml room temperature DMEM (no FBS, no Pen/Strep):
50 μg cis plasmid and 150 μg pDG9 (briefly vortex) and
700 μl PEI solution (pH 4.5). Vortex for 10–20 s and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.
6. Add the transfection mix to the pre-warmed 2 % FBS medium
and mix by swirling.
7. Gently remove the media from the cells in the triple flasks and
replace with transfection mix media.
8. Grow the transfected rAAV producing cells for 3 days, then
harvest.

AAV9 Production and Characterization

3.4 Harvesting
and Processing
3.4.1 Preparation
of Cell Lysate

97

1. Detach the cells by tapping the flask vigorously and transfer
the solution to a sterile 200 ml conical flask. Pellet the cells
by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min in a Sorvall RC-6+
centrifuge and SH-3000BK swinging bucket rotor.
2. Collect the cell culture supernatant in a sterile bottle for later
processing.
3. Gently add 10–15 ml PBS to the side of the conical tube. Swirl
gently to dislodge, but not break apart, the pellet. Transfer the
pellet to a 50 ml conical tube. Multiple pellets can be combined into one 50 ml tube for further processing. If cells
remain in the large conical, use the PBS to rinse the cells off
the large tube and transfer to the small tube.
4. Pellet the cells by centrifugation in a Sorvall RC-6+ centrifuge
and SH-3000BK rotor at 1000 × g for 10 min. Pour the supernatant into the bottle containing the cell culture supernatant
(see Note 8). Proceed with media to step 1 of Subheading 3.4.2.
At this step, the cell culture supernatant can be frozen at
−80 °C to be processed later.
5. Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml lysis buffer (see Note 9).
6. To lyse the cells, the cell suspension is repeatedly frozen and
thawed. The cell suspension can either be frozen by putting it
into a −80 °C freezer or on dry ice. The cell suspension is
thawed in a 37 °C water bath followed by brief vortexing. This
freeze/thaw cycle is repeated twice. Aggregation of cellular
debris during the freeze–thaw cycles is normal. Any of the
freezing steps can be used as a stopping point.
7. To digest genomic DNA and non-encapsidated viral DNA and
cellular RNA add 2 μl (10 U/μl) of Universal Nuclease to the
thawed, crude lysate and incubate for 30 min at room temperature (see also Note 1).
8. Centrifuge the crude lysate in a Sorvall RC-6+ centrifuge and
F13-14x50cy fixed angle rotor at 5000 × g for 20 min and
transfer the supernatant to a new tube (discard the pellet). The
new tube is ready for Iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation. It
can be stored at −80 °C at this point.

3.4.2 Processing
of the Cell Culture
Supernatant

1. If the cell culture supernatant was frozen (Subheading 3.2),
thaw it at 37 °C, but do not incubate longer than necessary. Per
100 ml of supernatant add 31.3 g ammonium sulfate and shake
for 1–2 min to dissolve completely the ammonium sulfate.
Incubate the mixture on ice for at least 30 min (see Note 10).
2. To pellet the virus precipitate, centrifuge in a Sorvall RC-6+
centrifuge and an F14-6x250y fixed angle rotor at 8300 × g
for 30 min. Because the pellet may be loose, pour off the
supernatant as soon as possible after centrifugation. THE
SUPERNATANT CANNOT BE STERILIZED WITH

98

Erik Kohlbrenner and Thomas Weber

BLEACH. INSTEAD, THE SUPERNATANT MUST BE
AUTOCLAVED AND THEN BE DISCARDED. Ammonium
Sulfate is incompatible with bleach, and treatment of the
supernatant with bleach would result in the production of
TOXIC GASES AND EXPLOSIVE COMPOUNDS.
3. The pellet will accumulate on the side of the centrifuge tube.
The pellet is resuspended with a pipette in 10 ml Lysis Buffer
(see Note 9). The resuspension is complete when there is no
remaining pellet on the wall of the tube and the solution is
homogeneous without any remaining “chunks”.
4. Add 2 μl (20 U) of Universal Nuclease for Cell Lysis (see
Note 1) and incubate 30 min at room temperature (or according to manufacturer’s instructions if using an alternative
nuclease). The virus suspension is now ready for iodixanol
gradient purification of the virus.
3.5 Preparation
of Ultracentrifugation
Gradients

1. Pipet 9.5 ml AAV cell lysate or virus suspension from cell culture supernatant into OptiSeal ultracentrifuge tubes. Try not
to introduce bubbles.

3.5.1 First Gradient

2. Insert a Pasteur pipet into the tube with the tip centered at the
bottom (see Note 11).
3. To form the gradient, underlay the viral solution in this order
by slowly adding to the top of the Pasteur pipette: (a) 7.3 ml
15 % iodixanol, (b) 5 ml 25 % iodixanol, (c) 4 ml 40 % iodixanol, and (d) 4 ml 60 % iodixanol. Before adding the next solution, allow all of the previous solution to reach the bottom of
the tube.
4. Carefully remove the Pasteur pipet without disturbing the
gradient.
5. If at this point the tube is not completely filled, add any leftover AAV crude lysate, virus suspension from the cell culture
supernatant or lysis buffer to the top of the tube to fill the tube
up to the neck. Any bubbles must be removed prior to centrifugation to prevent the collapse of the tubes during centrifugation. To remove potential bubbles slightly squeeze the
tube until the bubbles rise above the neck of the tube and
remove them with a pipet. Seal the tube by firmly inserting the
plastic stopper.
6. Use a permanent marker to draw a line at the 40–60 % interface. The interfaces are easy to see before centrifugation but
more difficult to visualize after centrifugation.
7. Centrifuge at (350,333 × g) in a Ti70 rotor for 1 h (see Note 12).
8. The majority of AAV particles will be located at the 60–40 %
iodixanol interface. The virus can be collected by inserting an
18-gauge needle (connected to a 5 ml syringe) just below the

AAV9 Production and Characterization

99

interface and slowly withdrawing 3 ml (These 3 ml will consist
of approximately the top 1 ml of the 60 % and the bottom 2 ml
of the 40 % iodixanol solution). Alternatively, if no second gradient is performed to concentrate further the virus, it is preferable to collect fractions from the bottom (see below:
Subheading 3.5.2, steps 5 and 6). Using this approach will
yield virus preparation with less empty particles (see Fig. 2).
9. Determine the AAV titer/yield by qPCR (see below
Subheading 3.7). If the viral titers are too low, combine the
virus from multiple tubes and proceed to second gradient.
3.5.2 Second Gradient

1. For a second round of iodixanol gradient purification (see
Note 13), dilute the harvested AAV/iodixanol solution in 1×
ODB such that the percentage of iodixanol is lower than 25 %.
For this calculation, the AAV/iodixanol harvested from the
first gradient is assumed to be 47 % (1 ml 60 % + 2 ml 40 %).
2. Add 22 ml of the AAV/iodixanol dilution into an OptiSeal
ultracentrifuge tube.
3. This solution is then underlaid sequentially with 4 ml 40 %
iodixanol and 60 % iodixanol using the technique described
above.
4. Centrifuge the tubes at 69,000 rpm (350,333 × g) in a Ti70
rotor for 2 h.
5. Collect 1.25 ml fractions from the bottom of the tube by creating a needle hole at the bottom of the tube, and letting the
contents drip into Eppendorf tubes pre-marked at the 1.25 ml
level. This can be done by covering the top opening of the
tube with a finger to create a vacuum to prevent flow, then
releasing the finger when the appropriate fraction tube is
placed under the bottom hole.
6. Run an alkaline gel of the fractions to identify the fractions
containing the majority of full-length viral genomes and combine those fractions.

3.6

Dialysis

1. Soak dialysis tubing in lactated Ringer’s solution overnight.
2. The next morning, squeeze out any lactated Ringer’s solution
left in the tubing, clamp one side of the tubing with a dialysis
clip, pipet the AAV/Iodixanol into the tubing, and clamp the
other end with a dialysis clip. To allow the easy recovery of the
virus, leave at least 2 in. of tubing hanging outside one of the
clamped ends of the tubing.
3. Place the closed dialysis tubing in a large sterile bottle with at
least 100 dialysate volumes of lactated Ringer’s solution.
4. Agitate the dialysis solution gently for 1–2 h on an orbital
shaker platform, and replace the lactated Ringer’s solution.

100

Erik Kohlbrenner and Thomas Weber

5. Agitate the dialysis solution for an additional 4–5 h, and
replace with fresh lactated Ringer’s solution.
6. Shake gently overnight. Remove the clamp on the side with
additional tubing and collect the contents of the tubing in a
50 ml tube. Filter through a 0.22 μm sterile syringe filter.
Aliquot and store at −80 °C (see Note 14).
AAV Vector Titration and Quality Control (See Note 15)
3.7 Viral Titer
Determination
by Quantitative
Real-Time PCR (qPCR)

1. Prepare a 2× master mix of reagents (2× SYBR Green, primers,
water, ROX passive reference dye) that will be enough for
duplicates of the following samples: four dilutions of standards
(see Note 2), two dilutions of AAV sample, and one notemplate control. Add 8 μl of master mix and 2 μl virus dilutions to each tube for a final reaction volume of 10 μl.
2. Thaw an aliquot of the ATCC AAV reference virus (or a well
characterized in-house produced AAV standard) as well as an
aliquot of the AAV to be quantified (see Note 3).
3. Prepare a standard curve of the reference virus by diluting the
virus stock: 1:1000; 1:10,000; 1:100,000; and 1:1,000,000.
4. Dilute the AAV sample 1:10,000 and 1:100,000.
5. Perform the PCR according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the PCR reagents and instrument manufacturer’s
instructions.
6. Calculate the viral titer based on the standard curve and
dilution of virus sample using the qPCR machine software
(see Note 3).

3.8 Assessment
of the Purity of Vector
Preparations
and Determination
of Total Viral Capsid
Titers

1. Prepare 10 % polyacrylamide gels and buffers and assemble
apparatus for running SDS-PAGE.
2. Dilute BSA standard solution to concentrations of 200, 100,
50, 25 ng/μl, then mix 10 μl of each with 20 μl water and 6 μl
6× SDS-PAGE Loading Buffer.
3. Mix 30 μl of AAV sample with 6 μl 6× SDS-PAGE Loading
Buffer.
4. Heat the viral samples at 95 °C for 5 min and the BSA standards at 95 °C for 3 min (BSA partially degrades at boiling
times longer than 3 min).
5. Load the samples into the wells and run at 125 V until the dye
line reaches the bottom of the gel, usually 2–3 h.
6. Remove the gel from the electrophoresis plate assembly and
soak in Pre-Staining Solution for 10 min while gently agitating
on a rocking platform.
7. Immerse the gel in Staining Solution and rock gently overnight in an airtight container.

Fig. 1 Representative gel for assessment of capsid content and purity. From left
to right: BioRad Precision Plus Dual Color Ladder, BSA 1,333 ng, BSA 666 ng,
BSA 333 ng, BSA 167 ng, BSA 83 ng, BSA 42 ng, AAV9-GFP (1.32x10 vg), AAV2RSM (2.41x10 vg)

8. The following day, replace the staining solution with destaining solution and add a rolled up paper towel to one side of the
container. Gently rock until the destaining solution and/or
the paper towel becomes soaked with stain. Then replace the
spent destaining solution with fresh destaining solution and
clean paper towel. Repeat until the gel shows little to no background staining (see Fig. 1).
9. Wash the gel by gently rocking it for 5 min in water. Repeat
this wash step once with fresh water.
10. Scan the gel on the LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Scanner or
equivalent fluorescence scanner. If no fluorescence scanner is
available, the gel can be scanned with a regular scanner,
although this appears to modestly reduce the accuracy of the
assay.
11. Quantify the relative intensity of the BSA and AAV VP3 bands
with the LI-COR software or freely available Image J (http://
imagej.nih.gov/ij/).
12. Plot the band intensity (arbitrary units [au]) vs. ng of BSA
loaded. Use a linear regression to obtain an equation that correlates ng of protein to band intensity. Use this equation to calculate the ng of protein in the VP3 band of the AAV sample.
13. The total viral particle (vp) titer can be calculated with the following formula: vp/μl = ng VP3/4.987 × 10−9/μl AAV sample
loaded per lane (see Note 16).

3.9 Determination
of Percent Genome
Containing AAV
Particles by Electron
Microscopy

1. Pick up an EM grid with a Dumont Anti-Capillary Reverse
(self-closing) tweezers and set down on the bench with the
shiny side of the grid facing up.
2. Pipet 5 μl of AAV sample onto the grid and allow it to dry by
evaporation. This may take 30–60 min.
3. Wash the grid by pipetting, drop by drop, about 200 μl water
onto the grid.
4. Wick excess water by slowly placing chromatography paper
vertically next to the grid.
5. Pipet 5 μl 2 % uranyl acetate solution onto the grid. Incubate
for 5 min (see Note 17), and then wick off as above. Let the
grid dry.
6. Visualize AAV particles with a transmission electron microscope at 50,000-fold magnification. Viral capsid containing a
viral genome will appear as homogeneously white hexagons,
while empty capsids show as hexagons with a white rim but a
dark center (see Fig. 2).
7. Randomly count at least 100 particles to determine approximate
percentage of genome-containing vs. empty AAV particles.

3.10 Alkaline Gel
Electrophoresis
to Determine Vector
Genome Integrity (and
Viral Genome Titers)

1. Prepare the alkaline agarose gel by adding 1 g agarose to 98 ml
water and microwave to dissolve. Let the solution cool until it
can be handled without gloves, then add 2 ml 50× Alkaline
Electrophoresis Buffer, swirl to mix, pour to cast the gel.
2. Place the gel into an electrophoresis apparatus, fill with 1×
Alkaline Running Buffer, and place everything in a cold room.
3. Dilute DNA ladder (500 ng) to 25 μl with water.
4. Mix 25 μl AAV sample or diluted DNA ladder with 8.5 μl 4×
alkaline sample loading buffer, heat to 95 °C for 3 min, then
cool on ice prior to loading on the gel.
5. Load the gel and run overnight at 20 V in the cold room using
a dedicated pow er supply (see Note 18).

in fraction 4, indicating that fraction 5 and especially fraction 6 contain empty
capsids (SDS-PAGE, not shown)

6. Remove the gel from the electrophoresis apparatus, place the
gel in a container and cover it with 0.1 M Tris–HCl pH 8.5
and rock gently for 1 h.
7. Discard the buffer and replace with 4× GelRed or SYBR Gold
in 0.1 M NaCl and rock protected from light for 2 h.
8. Rinse the gel briefly in tap water.
9. Visualize the gel with a UV transilluminator and capture a
digital picture (see Fig. 3 and Note 19).

Notes
1. Alternative nucleases that digest double DNA, single-stranded
DNA and RNA can also be used, for instance benzonase
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), to achieve the same result. If
benzonase is used, add 2 μl 2.5 M MgCl2 and 2 μl benzonase
(1500 U/μl) to 10 ml crude lysate and incubate 1 h at 37 °C.
2. Extensively characterized, AAV2 and AAV8 reference standard
material can be obtained from ATCC (cat. nos. VR-1616 and
VR-1816, respectively). The broad use of these reference standards should facilitate the reproducibility of titer determinations among different laboratories. For economic reasons, it
might be preferable to employ the ATCC standard viruses to
prepare a thoroughly characterized in house reference virus
preparation. It needs to be pointed out; however, unless ITR-

104

Erik Kohlbrenner and Thomas Weber

specific primers are used [12], the reference standards can only
be used for the titration of AAVs that share other common
sequence elements with the AAV standards.
3. If an in house reference standard is used that is single-stranded,
and the virus to be titered is self-complementary, the final titer
should be divided by 2. In this context, it also needs to be
pointed out that the accurate titer determination of doublestranded AAVs has additional pitfalls, see [13].
4. For further information on designing and constructing cis
plasmids, see Gray [10].
5. HEK293T cells are a human cell line, and all work must be
performed in accordance with Biosafety Level 2 (BSL2) regulations. This includes the use of a BSL2 laminar flow tissue
culture hood. Adeno-associated viruses are BSL1, but all work
with AAV should be performed under sterile conditions.
6. 293T cells can be passaged for about 1–2 months after thawing the initial vial, as long as they are regularly split at least
twice a week.
7. Split cells depending on confluency. If the flask is very confluent, split 1:6, if less confluent 1:4. The goal is to achieve
approximately 70 % cell confluency the next day.
8. Because this PBS pellet wash solution can contain AAV, we
routinely combine it with the cell culture supernatant.
9. The maximum volume of crude lysate that can be loaded in a
single ultracentrifugation tube is 10 ml. However, the cell pellets from up to three triple flasks can be combined and resuspended in 10 ml lysis buffer. After freeze/thaw and clearing of
the lysate the combined lysate can be loaded into a single tube.
Similarly, it is possible to resuspend the pellets of precipitated
AAV from cell culture supernatant of up to three triple flasks.
10. Although incubation on ice for as little as 30 min is sufficient
for virus precipitation, keeping the ammonium sulfate/cell
culture supernatant mixture for several days at 4 °C will not
affect the quality of the virus. However, once the virus precipitate has been spun down, the pellet should be resuspended
and loaded onto a gradient the same day. Resuspending the
pellet and freezing for a later gradient is not recommended as
aggregation appears upon thawing.
11. The creation of multiple iodixanol gradients can be facilitated
by using a multichannel peristaltic pump (available, for
instance, from Watson-Marlow; Paramus, NJ) to assemble
several gradients simultaneously. With such a system the different iodixanol solutions can be delivered to multiple tubes
at the same time, which reduces the number of necessary
pipetting steps. Using this method, up to four centrifugations

AAV9 Production and Characterization

105

(with Ti70 rotors, holding 8 tubes each) can be performed in
1 day.
12. If a different rotor is used, the speed and run times have to be
adjusted using the k-factors of the Ti70 rotor the 69,000 rpm
(k = 44.9) and the respective k-factor of the alternate rotor at a
given speed. A convenient tool for this calculation can be
found at: https://www.beckmancoulter.com
13. Calculate whether the AAV titer is sufficiently high for the
planned experiments. Especially for in vivo experiments, when
small injection volumes are necessary, it might be necessary to
concentrate further the virus. In addition to concentrating the
virus, if the virus was collected as a single fraction during the
first gradient purification, this second ultracentrifugation gradient also allows the removal of empty capsids that may have
been collected together with the genome-containing AAV
particles from the first gradient.
14. For long-term storage, AAV is preferably stored at
−80 °C. However, AAVs are extraordinarily stable; recent
reports have shown no loss of activity after 1 week of storage
at room temperature [11]. This can have important
implications for the shipping of AAVs. In particular, the quality of the virus is likely unaffected if all dry ice has evaporated
due to unanticipated delays in the delivery of the virus. Because
of the danger of damaging the AAV genome, never expose
AAV to UV light (such as in a bio-safety cabinet).
15. The quality of AAVs purchased from academic vector cores or
commercial vendors can vary significantly. This is especially
true for double-stranded AAVs or AAVs with a genome size
approaching the maximum packaging capacity of the AAV
capsid. Therefore, we recommend a thorough in-house characterization before performing any experiments.
16. The calculation of capsid concentration is based on the molecular weight of VP3 (calculated from its amino acid composition), which is 60,063 Da. Because each capsid contains 50
VP3 subunits, the combined molecular weight of VP3 subunits in a single capsid is approximately 3 MDa, and each capsid contains 4.9868 × 10−18 g of VP3 [14]. Dividing the
amount of VP3 (in g) by 4.9868 × 10−18 g will yield the number of viral particles.
17. The incubation time is critical. Shorter incubation times will
cause empty viral particles to appear as particles with encapsidated genomes.
18. Moving the power supply frequently from the cold room to
room temperature will damage the power supply due to water
condensation.

106

Erik Kohlbrenner and Thomas Weber

19. Alkaline gel electrophoresis can also be used to determine
AAV titers. For this, a dilution series of a mass DNA ladder, or
dilutions of a linear DNA fragment of known concentration
and, preferably, of similar size to the AAV genome (e.g., the
cis plasmid digested with SmaI if the only SmaI sites are in the
viral ITRs) will be loaded onto the same gel as the AAV samples to be quantified. Quantification can then be achieved with
the freely available ImageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) or
similar program. This method is especially useful if the AAV
samples to be quantified do not share sequence elements with
the reference standard and for double-stranded AAVs.

Cell-Based Measurement of Neutralizing Antibodies
Against Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV)
Andreas Jungmann, Oliver Müller, and Kleopatra Rapti
Abstract
In recent years gene therapy using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to treat cardiac disease has seen an
unprecedented surge, owing to its safety, low immunogenicity relative to other vectors and high and longterm transduction efficiency. This field has also been hampered by the presence of preexisting neutralizing
antibodies, not only in patients participating in clinical trials but also in preclinical large animal models.
These conflicting circumstances have generated the need for a simple, efficient, and fast assay to screen
subjects for the presence of neutralizing antibodies, or lack thereof, in order for them to be included in
gene therapy trials.
Key words Neutralizing antibody, Assay, AAV vectors, In vitro, Human and animal serum

Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in the western countries [1]. Adeno-associated viral
(AAV) gene therapy [2–4] is a promising alternative to current
therapies, such as pharmacological treatments. However, AAVs are
naturally occurring viruses, meaning that both humans [5–7] and
animals [8–11] used in biomedical research carry neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against the serotypes. Animals or candidates carrying
these antibodies cannot benefit from AAV based gene therapies, as
the AAVs are neutralized before they reach their target, such as the
heart or the liver [12, 13]. Several approaches have been developed
to evade such neutralizing effects; however, the current strategy is
to screen animals or patients and exclude them from further studies [13]. The latter necessitates the development of fast, efficient,
and cost-effective methodologies to screen for them. A summary
of screens for neutralizing activity conducted in humans and large
animals can be found in Table 1. As shown, for the most of the
studies the nAb assay was used to assess seroprevalence of antibodies against AAVs. Attention should be brought to the variability in

the way one interprets seropositive samples in the population, in
other words the cutoff value used to determine the percentage of
the population that is positive for nAb against an AAV serotype. It
is also noteworthy that serum is the preferred tissue.
Immunoglobulins can also diffuse into extravascular tissues, but
serum collection is easy, and highly indicative of the humoral
immune status [14].

Andreas Jungmann et al.

The methods proposed in most studies to measure AAV neutralizing ability of serum, or else the nAb titers, are (1) the nAb assay, in
which one tests the ability of serum to inhibit transduction of cells
by AAVs carrying usually luciferase as a reporter gene, followed by
(2) ELISA and in one study (3) a native dot blot analysis. ELISAbased assays [15] are easy and provide extensive information regarding the immunoglobulins binding to viruses, also with regard to
class categorization (IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE), but antibody binding
does not necessarily reflect neutralization of transduction. It is also
of note, that there are additional factors in the blood that could also
affect AAV transduction efficiency, such as galectin 3 binding protein [16] and C-reactive protein [17]. In vivo assays provide useful
information in a more relevant setting, but they are complicated,
time consuming, costly and have ethical concerns. The method that
provides the most useful insights, is cost effective and can be upscaled for screening of multiple samples concurrently is the cellbased nAb assay [8, 18]. The principle is simple: several dilutions of
serum (the lower the dilution, for example 1/4, the higher the
amount of serum, and therefore the higher the putative amount of
antibodies) are mixed with equal amount of AAVs (quantified in
viral genomes) and the gene transduction is measured (Fig. 1). The
mixes of the different serum dilutions with AAVs, and also a noserum control, are used to transduce cells. If the serum contains
more antibodies against AAVs, then the higher amount of antibodies present in the lower dilutions of serum (for example 1/4) will
bind and thus inactivate more AAVs leading to lower transduction
output by the reporter gene, in comparison to the higher dilutions
(for example 1/256). The no-serum control provides the maximum
transduction efficiency, to which the samples are to be compared.
The output is usually measured as percent transduction efficiency
compared to the no-serum control. A typical curve of a serum with
relatively abundant antibodies appears as a linear increase of the %
transduction levels as the dilution factor increases (for example 1/4–
1/256) (Fig. 1d). A typical curve of a serum that does not contain
antibodies is almost flat, with even the lower serum dilution samples
exhibiting 100 % transduction levels, compared to no serum control
(Fig. 1d). The nAb titer is determined as the highest dilution, in
which more than 50 % of inhibition is observed for the first time.

depicts an nAb assay using serum with high levels of neutralizing antibodies, where even the smallest amount
of serum (dilution 1/256) leads to a more than 50 % inhibition of transduction compared to no serum control

Methods
Carry out all procedures at room temperature and keep all solutions on ice.
nAb Assay

For the assay, two plates are needed: one “Cell Plate” (normal cell
culture treated 96 well plate) and one “Serum Mix Plate” (V-Bottom
96 well plate). In the latter varying serum dilutions will be mixed
with constant amount of AAVs. These will then be transferred to
the “Cell Plate.” Column 1 of “Serum Mix Plate” contains enough
solution for quadruplets (the assay is in triplicate) and will be transferred in three Columns of the “Cell Plate” (Columns 1–3) (Fig. 1c).

3.1.1 Day 0: Preparation
of “Cell Plate” (See Note 1)

1. Take the flask with 293T cells (usually a confluent T75 is
enough for one 96-well plate) from the incubator and place it
under the hood.

3.1

2. Remove complete medium and add 10 ml 1× PBS. Wash the
cells and remove medium.
3. Add 1.5 ml of trypsin–EDTA 0.05 % and incubate at 37 °C for
3–5 min, until the cells detach. Add 8.5 ml of complete
medium and count the cells in a Neubauer chamber.
4. Transfer 1 × 107 cells (see Note 2) to a falcon tube and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min. Remove all supernatant carefully and
resuspend in 5 ml DMEM, P/S (see Note 3).
5. Using a multichannel pipette, transfer 50 μl of cell suspension
to each well of a 96-well plate. This corresponds to 1 × 105
cells/well (see Note 2). This will be the “Cell Plate.”
6. Transfer plate to the incubator (37 °C, 5 % CO2) and incubate
for 4–5 h.
3.1.2 Day 0: Preparation
of “Serum Mix Plate”
(See Notes 4–6)—Part I:
Serum Mix (Fig. 1a, b)

Bring all materials under the hood: V-bottom 96-well plate,
DMEM, P/S, test serum, multichannel pipette, and AAVs (the
virus preferably on ice, although it is quite stable at room temperature for short periods of time) (see Notes 4 and 5). The dilutions
of the serum will be done on the vertical axis that is from row A to
row G, and row H will have the no-serum control. Every column
represents one assay, for example one AAV serotype with one test
serum. One can test multiple AAVs with multiple sera at the same
time. In this protocol we will describe only one assay for simplicity
purposes, although several assays can be performed in parallel (four
columns in a “Serum Mix Plate” can be used for a whole (12 columns) “Cell Plate”). The final volume per well in the “Serum Mix
Plate” will be 80 μl, which corresponds to quadruplet (4 × 20 μl).
20 μl will be transferred to each of 3 wells in the “Cell Plate” for a
triplicate, leaving some serum-AAV mix in the “Serum Mix Plate”
to account for pipetting losses. In the “Serum Mix Plate” half of
this volume (40 μl of 80 μl) will be serum dilutions and the other

AAV Neutralizing Antibody Assay

117

half will be the AAV solution (40 μl of 80 μl). For a visual description of the assay, please refer to Fig. 1.
1. Using the multichannel pipette, pipette 40 μl of DMEM, P/S
to each well in column 1.
2. To well A1 (row A) pipet 40 μl of test serum and mix by pipetting three times. The volume now is 80 μl.
3. Transfer 40 μl from well A1 to well B1 (row B) and mix by
pipetting three times. A1 contains now 40 μl: 20 μl of test
serum and 20 μl of DMEM, P/S. The volume in B1 now is
80 μl.
4. Transfer 40 μl from well B1 to well C1 (row C) and mix by
pipetting three times. B1 contains now 40 μl: 10 μl of test
serum and 30 μl of DMEM, P/S. The volume in C1 now is
80 μl. Continue until row G. From well G1 remove 40 μl of
the last 80 μl and discard.
3.1.3 Preparation
of “Serum Mix Plate”
(See Notes 4 and 5):
Part II: Virus Addition
and Incubation (Fig. 1b)

Each well of the “Cell Plate” contains 1 × 105 cells. In order to
achieve an infection of 1000 vg/cell (see Note 2), one needs to add
1 × 108 vg/well. Each well of the “Serum Mix Plate” contains a
mix for quadruplet infection (3× for each well of the “Cell Plate”
and one extra), which corresponds to 4 × 108 vg/well. In total, for
column 1 one needs 3.2 × 109 vg (8 × 4 × 108) in a volume of 320 μl
DMEM, P/S (8 × 40 μl).
1. Prepare AAV-Luc mix in DMEM, P/S: 3.2 × 109 vg in 320 μl
of DMEM, P/S in a 1.5 ml tube. Mix well by pipetting and
inverting the tube.
2. Transfer 40 μl of the mix to each well of column 1 in “Serum
Mix Plate” and mix by pipetting.
3. Transfer “Serum Mix Plate” to the incubator and incubate for
30 min at 37 °C.

3.1.4 Transfer of Test
Serum/AAV Mix to Cell
Plate (Fig. 1c)

1. Place both “Serum Mix Plate” and “Cell Plate” in the sterile
hood.
2. Using the multichannel pipette, take 20 μl from each well of
column 1 of “Serum Mix Plate” and transfer it to column 1 of
“Cell Plate.” In order to minimize damage to the cells, do not
pipette directly onto the cells, but release the drop on the side
of the wall of the well and let it drop. Swirl gently to mix.
Repeat for columns 2 and 3 of “Cell Plate.”
3. Transfer “Cell Plate” to the incubator and incubate at 37 °C
with 5 % CO2 for 2 days (see Note 7).

3.1.5 Day 2: Luciferase
Assay (See Notes 8–12)

1. Prepare working solutions.
2. Remove the plate from the incubator. The rest of the procedure can be done on the working bench.

3. Lysis: Using a multichannel pipette, transfer 70 μl of 2× Lysis
Buffer to each well and mix by pipetting. Incubate at room
temperature with gentle rocking for 10 min.
4. Mix with substrate: transfer 20 μl of cell lysate to the luminometer plate using the multichannel pipette. Transfer 100 μl
of reaction mixture and mix (see Note 8).

1. Percent of Transduction to no-Serum Control, mean value:
(average of RLU (Relative Luciferase Units) values of sample − average of RLU values of negative control)/(average of
RLU values of no-serum control − average of RLU values of
negative control) × 100.
2. Percent of Transduction to no-Serum Control, standard deviation: (standard deviation of: RLU values of each sample − average RLU value of negative control)/(average of RLU values
of no-serum control − average of RLU values of negative
control) × 100.
1. The titer is determined as the highest serum dilution in which
more than 50 % of inhibition is observed, in other words the
first titer in which the percent of transduction to no-serum
control is less than 50 % (see Notes 13 and 14).

Notes
1. Cell line: Several lines can be used for this assay, such as 293T,
C2C12, HeLa, CHO, Huh7, HepG2 etc. The cell line does
not affect the output of the assay [18], as the assay is based on
comparison to an internal control. Most laboratories use typically the 293T cell line, therefore the described experiments
are performed with 293T. Even though some serotypes, such
as AAV8 and 9, inefficiently transduce this cell line, the RLUs
(Relative Luciferase Units) provide a sufficient range of values
for conclusive results. One could choose another line, but one
should also consider the cost and labor intensity.
2. Cell number: the cell number can greatly influence the transduction output in terms of RLUs (Fig. 2). It is recommended
to use high numbers, so as to achieve confluence of 90 %. This
maximizes the number of cells available to be transduced,
thereby reducing the viral genomes/cell needed for a reasonable output. The lower the viral genomes/cell ratio is, the
higher the sensitivity of the assay [18].

AAV Neutralizing Antibody Assay

119

Fig. 2 Effect of cell number on transduction efficiency of AAV6 and AAV9: Serial
dilutions of 293T cells were plated and were infected with 1 × 108 vg of each
serotype. The luciferase measurements were performed 24 h later. There is a positive correlation between cell number and luciferase output, as measured in RLUs

3. The DMEM, P/S solution has to be pre-warmed at 37 °C. The
cells are plated without serum, as serum (FBS, pooled mouse
serum [8]) can affect transduction of different serotypes
(Fig. 3). Since there is no serum in the medium, the cells are
relatively sensitive. In addition, since they will also be used
within hours, plating efficiency needs to be maximized. It is
therefore recommended to pre-warm the DMEM, P/S for at
least 30 min. It is also recommended to make aliquots of 15 ml
in 15 ml Falcon tubes for single use. This way the medium is
minimally exposed to air and thus preserved better (the pH
value is not altered).
4. Virus purification: It is important that the AAV content is as
high as possible in full (viral genome containing) capsids. The
iodixanol purification methodology provides a simple and efficient system for the purification of AAVs from cell debris, nonassembled capsids and non-packaged DNA and for the
enrichment of full as opposed to empty capsids. However,
attention should be paid to the separation of full from empty
capsids, as higher empty capsid content leads to an underestimation of the nAb titer. It is therefore advised to collect fractions from the iodixanol gradients that are expected to contain
the highest encapsidated viral genome content. It should be
pointed out that at the 25–15 % iodixanol layers one will detect
non-packaged DNA, but not AAV viral capsid packaged DNA
(Fig. 4) [19, 20].

Fig. 3 FBS inhibits transduction by AAV6 but enhances transduction by AAV9: Serial dilutions of 293T cells were
plated and were infected with 1 × 108 vg of each serotype in the absence or presence of 20 μl of FBS. The
luciferase measurements were performed 24 h later

Fig. 4 Viral genome distribution of AAV6 in iodixanol gradients. The cell lysate of
293T cells transfected for the production of AAV6 (double plasmid transfection as
described before [8]) was loaded on an iodixanol gradient (2 ml 15 %, 2 ml 25 %,
2 ml 40 %, and 2 ml 60 %[8]). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected starting from
60 % towards 25 %. The majority of the viral genomes was concentrated in fraction 4 (corresponds to the top part of 60 % fraction) and it was collected for
experiments. Fractions 5 and higher [19, 20] contain higher amounts of empty
capsids and should be avoided. Fractions 10 or higher contain unpackaged viral
genomes and plasmids and should be avoided (see Note 4)

AAV Neutralizing Antibody Assay

5. Transgene: The choice of transgene is critical for the assay, as
it can influence the sensitivity [18]. Luciferase (preferably
under the control of a strong promoter, such as CMV) is the
best/suggested system of choice, as it is highly sensitive, it has
a high dynamic range (up to 5 orders of magnitude in most
luminometers), and it is easy to measure (30 min to prepare
and read an entire plate).
6. Heat inactivation of test serum: several reports propose the
heat inactivation of the complement components of the serum.
Deposition of activated complement components on the viral
capsid results in enhanced uptake by specific cell types, such as
CD4+ [21]. However, the cell lines typically used in the assays
described herein are not affected by complement activation
and heat inactivation of serum has no effect on the output of
the assay (data not shown and [18]).
7. Transduction efficiency: some serotypes may not transduce certain cell types efficiently. However, the appropriate cell lines, for
example cardiac myocytes for the cardiotropic AAVs, may be
costly and time consuming. There are several technical improvements that have been explored by individual researchers.
(a) Days of incubation: incubation of 2 days would give sufficient time for“slow” transducing serotypes, such as
AAV9, to maximize the output expression. One should
consider however the effect on cell viability due to prolonged culture.
(b) The simplest way to perform the assay is to dilute the test
serum in DMEM, P/S. The first row (A) has the highest
content of test serum, which is then gradually reduced up
to row G, whereas the no-serum control contains no
serum. Serum and the factors therein affect, however, cell
viability and function, which are necessary for viral transduction. This practically means that the transduction efficiency, which is reflected by the luciferase activity levels,
will be higher in the wells with test serum compared to
no-serum control, assuming of course that the serum does
not contain antibodies (the wells in row A would have
transduction efficiencies of more than 100 %). The test
serum from a specific species can also be diluted in serum
from the same species, but attention should be paid to the
fact that the serum may contain antibodies [8]. There are
commercial kits to remove antibodies from serum.
Another alternative is also commercially available immunoglobulin depleted serum (Immunoglobulins (all)
Depleted Serum, SF505-2, BBI Solutions). However this
does not preclude the presence of other factors that affect
transduction efficiency [16, 17]. All these alternatives
should be tested before the assay is performed.

122

Andreas Jungmann et al.

(c) Addition of FBS 24 h after infection for incubation times
longer than 2 days: an alternative to increase the transduction efficiency is to increase the incubation time to more
than 2 days, as there are several rate limiting steps in AAV
transduction [22]. Addition of FBS at 10–15 % several
hours after infection, so that the transduction efficiency is
not affected as seen with AAV6 (Fig. 3), can also improve
the output of the assay. Even though, as shown in Fig. 5,
the mean RLU values with (24 h DMEM, P/S, addition
of FBS to 15 % for another 24 or 48 h) and without FBS
at 48 h after infections are not affected, the variation in
the wells, as indicated by the high standard deviation of
the no-FBS sample, is reduced. That is because the viability of the cells in the no-FBS condition reduces with time,
so in some of the wells the luciferase output was already
decreasing at the time of the measurement. As shown in
Fig. 5, incubation of the cells for longer times (3 days)
decreases the efficiency of the assay.
8. Preparation of luciferase substrate: the luciferase substrate has
a short half-life, which should be determined experimentally
for each laboratory. Typically it is around 30 min. The plate
reading requires about 5 min, so the order with which the
luciferase substrate is pipetted into the luminometer plate is
critical. It is recommended to pipette row A to row H and follow this order when setting up the luminometer.

Fig. 5 Supplementation of medium with FBS 24 h after infection improves assay
output. Cells were infected and 24 h later FBS was added and measurements
were taken at 24, 48, and 72 h post infection (Day 0 of assay). Addition of FBS
seems to stabilize the cells, which results in lower variability in luciferase assay
output. However, luciferase assay output is reduced after 3 days in culture

AAV Neutralizing Antibody Assay

123

9. Determination of dynamic range of relative luciferase units:
before using a new luminometer, one needs to determine the
dynamic range. To do so, one can simply use commercially
available luciferase enzyme. Alternatively, simply transfecting
293T cells with different amounts of a plasmid carrying the
CMV-Luc cassette should suffice. The higher range of the
assay is determined, when lysates from cells transfected with
several sequentially increasing amounts of DNA produce the
same RLUs, which means a plateau has been reached. The
lower range can be determined using no-transfection control.
10. Positive and negative controls: the no-serum control serves as
a positive control, where the lack of serum with nAbs would
produce maximum AAV transduction efficiency, high expression of luciferase in the cells, and RLU values in the assay. As
a negative control, non-infected control cells are used. Both
positive and negative controls should be included in every
plate. If the transduction efficiency of a serotype typically
exceeds the negative control by at least 3 orders of magnitude,
then one can omit negative control. Additional controls for
the assay can be used, particularly when first determining the
sensitivity of the assay, such as pooled human serum (available
through multiple vendors) or IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulins). These reagents are guaranteed to inhibit transduction, at least at the higher titer dilution and therefore should
provide useful information to the inexperienced researcher.
11. Luciferase assay substrate: there are commercially available kits
that are simpler to use, and probably more stable and with
longer half-life compared to the system described here.
However, for screening of multiple sera, the cost rises proportionally. Since this system is approximately 20–40-fold more
economical, it is recommended to use this when planning to
screen multiple samples.
12. Luminescence reader: there are various commercially available
readers, with varying dynamic ranges. It is recommended to
determine this range, prior to the experiments. In order for
the assays to be comparable, the results are expressed as percent of transduction compared to no-serum control.
13. Range of serum dilutions: depending on the availability of
serum and the level of inhibition (it is quite often that even a
dilution of 1/256 will completely inhibit transduction) a
range of higher serum dilutions can be chosen, such as 1/16
through 1/1024. In order to achieve this dilution, simply add
5 μl of test serum to 35 μl of DMEM, P/S at well A1 of
“Serum Mix Plate” (Subheading 3.1.2, step 1) and continue
with the dilutions from that point on.

124

Andreas Jungmann et al.

14. Titer determination: if the transduction of the critical titer
dilution is very close to the 50 % (for example 49 %), it is suggested to repeat the assay. In general, there is inter-assay variability. That is, repeating the assay with the same serum will
sometimes not produce the same titer, but a neighboring one.
It is also recommended to repeat the assays twice for sera with
titers in the range of interest or cutoff.

Synthesis of Modified mRNA for Myocardial Delivery
Jason Kondrat, Nishat Sultana, and Lior Zangi
Abstract
Cardiac gene therapy shows tremendous promise in combating the growing problem of heart disease.
Modified mRNA (modRNA) is a novel gene delivery system used in vitro or in vivo to achieve transient
expression of therapeutic proteins in a heterogeneous population of cells. Incorporation of specific modified nucleosides enables modRNA to be translated efficiently without triggering antiviral and innate
immune responses. ModRNA has been shown to be effective at delivering short-term robust gene expression to the heart and its use in the field of cardiac gene therapy is expanding. Here, we describe a stepwise
protocol for the synthesis of modRNA for in vivo myocardial delivery.
Key words Modified mRNA, Myocardial infarction, Myocardial delivery, Gene therapy, In vitro

Introduction
The field of Cardiac gene therapy is expanding, yet its use in the clinical setting is limited. Currently the most widely used method for
targeting gene expression to the heart is through viral vectors, particularly the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector [1–3]. Viral gene
therapy shows promise yet its applications are limited due to its length
of expression and inability to regulate gene expression in a quantifiable dose manner [1–3]. Modified mRNA (modRNA) is a novel and
effective gene delivery method that provides short-term (1–2 weeks),
titratable gene expression for use both in vitro or in vivo [4–9].
The use of unmodified exogenous RNA as a gene delivery
method is ineffective due to its instability outside the cell and the
strong innate immune response it elicits when transfected into
cells [10, 11]. However, Kariko et al. discovered that the substitution of uridine and cytidine with pseudouridine and 5-methylcytidine, respectively, drastically reduced the immune response
elicited from exogenous RNA [11, 12]. Investigation into the
mechanism revealed that the nucleoside substitutions resulted in
a conformational change in the RNA that caused reduced response

by toll like receptors 3, 7, and 8 (TLR3, TLR7, TLR 8), and retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1) [13]. A further decrease in
RIG-1 response from modRNA was seen upon removal of the 5′
triphosphates [4, 10]. In order to increase stability and translational efficiency, a 3′-O-Me-m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G Anti Reverse Cap
Analog (ARCA) cap is substituted at the 5′ end of the RNA
molecule [4, 5, 10].
The synthesis of modRNA for in vivo use involves four stages:
DNA template creation containing the desired transcript, in vitro
transcription (IVT), 5′ phosphate removal with Antarctic phosphatase, and precipitation with 5 M ammonium acetate salt.
Investigation into the use of modRNA for experimental and clinical purposes is growing rapidly. Daily transfection with modRNA
encoding reprogramming factors OCT4, SOX2, MYC, and KLF4
were successful at reprogramming human fibroblasts back to pluripotency [5, 8]. Additionally, modRNA has been shown to be capable of directing cell fate in vitro by using MyoD modRNA that
resulted in the conversion of fibroblasts to skeletal muscle cells [2].
ModRNA has also shown promise in directing cell fate in vivo. We
used VEGF-A modRNA to direct heart progenitor cells to induce
vascularization in the heart [4]. The expanding use of modRNA
technology in vivo and its potential use in the field of cardiac gene
therapy motivated us to generate a step-wise, streamlined protocol
for the effective synthesis of modRNA for in vivo use.

UTR’s (Fig. 1).
2. The 5′- and 3′-UTRs are synthesized de novo by synthetic
oligos. The synthesized UTR’s are annealed together and
amplified using forward and reverse primers. To provide an

ModRNA Yield

1. Measure concentration using NanoDrop machine (Fig. 3b).
The ratio of A260/A280 should be greater than 1.8 with values
closer to 2.0 indicating higher purity. Depending on yield,
concentration should be close to 20 μg/μl.
2. For better quality control analysis take a 1 μl sample from the
final modRNA solution and dilute it into 100 μl of nuclease-free
water. Analyze sample using a bioanalyzer machine (Fig. 3c).

3.7 Preparation
of modRNA
for Myocardial
Injection in Mice

1. Combine 40 μl of RNAiMax and 5 μl of OptiMEM in one
eppendorf tube and vortex. Let mixture sit for 10 min at room
temperature.
2. In another eppendorf tube combine 150–200 μg (see Note 6)
of modRNA and 5 μl of OptiMEM. Spin down to eliminate
liquid on the sides of the tube.
3. After letting the RNAiMAX and OptiMEM mixture sit for
10 min at room temperature, add the liquid from the tube
with the modRNA mixture to the tube with the RNAiMAX
mixture (see Note 7).
4. Let combined mixture stand for 15 min at room temperature.
Extract mixture into the 31 G insulin syringe and inject into
mouse myocardium (Example of result shown in Fig. 4).

Notes
1. The adenine nucleotide (A) of the first codon (ATG) should
be omitted from forward primer sequence as it is provided by
the AleI site.
2. pTEMPlz plasmid and derivatives should be propagated in
bacterial strain resistant to the ccdB gene product such as One
Shot® ccdB Survival™ 2T1 Phage-Resistant (T1R) cells.
3. Transformation of plasmid in competent cells such as One
shot® TOP10 chemically competent E. coli might be necessary
to attain a proper amount of DNA plasmid needed to create
enough tailed DNA template for the IVT reaction.
4. If using 2× KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix, elongation step
of Thermocycler should be set at a ratio of 30 s per Kb of ORF
length.
5. At this point uncleaned modified mRNA can be stored in
−80 °C up to 2 weeks to be cleaned at a later date.
6. If concentration is 20 μg/μl, then add 10 μl.
7. It is important to add the modRNA mixture to the RNAiMAX
mixture and not the other way around.

Exosomes-Based Gene Therapy for MicroRNA Delivery
Prabhu Mathiyalagan and Susmita Sahoo
Abstract
Despite recent advances in scientific knowledge and clinical practice, cardiovascular disease management
and treatment remain a major burden. While several treatment strategies using drugs and surgeries are
being developed for cardiovascular manifestations, gene-based therapies hold significant promise. Recent
findings from our laboratory unveiled a novel mechanism that exosomes, secreted nanovesicles from stem
cells, mediate cardiac repair via transferring their unique repertoire of microRNAs (miRNA) to recipient
cells in the heart. Exosomes, unlike other vectors for gene delivery, present unique advantages such that
exosomes are a cell-free natural system for ferrying RNA between cells, robust exosomal membrane can
protect the RNA/gene of interest from digestion, and exosomes are rapidly taken up by target cells making
them a more efficient vehicle for gene delivery. Here, we describe a stepwise protocol developed in our
laboratory for generating exosomes from human CD34+ stem cells that carry exogenously applied Cy3
dye-labeled pre-miR miRNA precursors. We demonstrate that human CD34+ stem cell exosomes can rigorously enter into recipient cells and deliver Cy3 dye-labeled pre-miR miRNA precursors to regulate gene
expression. Identification of key molecular targets to treat disease conditions is the foremost critical step
and the novel approach presented here to generate exosomes carrying exogenous genetic information
offers a valuable clinical tool for more effective treatment strategies.

Introduction
Almost after three decades since first report, exosomes are now recognized as vital mediators of cell–cell communication. Exosomes are
extracellular vesicles of endocytic origin secreted by almost every cell
type in humans and typically range in 30–100 nm size [1]. Exosomes
carry macromolecules including lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids
(mainly RNA) and their composition reflects their parent cell [2]. In
the past few years, the exosomes field has grown exponentially both
in the aspect of fundamental cell biology as well as pathologies
involving cancer and cardiovascular diseases [3]. Indeed, secreted
exosomes containing biologically active macromolecules can selectively bind to cell surface receptors presented by recipient cells.
Upon receptor binding, exosomes are thought to transduce specific

intracellular signaling thereby inducing physiological changes in
recipient cells [4]. Another mechanism by which exosomes mediate
biological information is through direct transfer of intra-exosomal
content such as mRNA and microRNA (miRNA or miR) inside
recipient cells by fusion with cell membrane [5]. Herein, in-depth
understanding of exosomes-mediated biological information transfer is a critical step towards gaining deeper insights to exosomes
function in both physiology and pathophysiology.
MiRNAs are critical regulators of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level in higher eukaryotes [6]. Regulation of miRNA
expression is tightly coordinated in a developmental and tissuespecific fashion [7]. Perturbations to miRNA expression lead to
severe developmental anomalies [8]. Several miRNAs have been
implicated to have role in chronic diseases and conditions such as
cancer, heart and neurodegenerative diseases [9]. Consequently,
miRNAs are regarded as potential pharmacological candidates for
therapeutic treatment as well as for biomarker discoveries in heart
failure [10]. For instance, expression of miRNA is deregulated
under pathological heart conditions and a major pharmacological
interest is to restore endogenous miRNA expression either through
the use of miRNA “mimics” or “inhibitors” under disease states
[11, 12]. However, a major limitation is the lack of efficient cellspecific gene delivery system as well as off-target toxicity effects.
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is one of the efficient delivery methods for gene therapy that has been widely in practice for long time.
In the treatment of heart failure, AAV-mediated gene delivery for
genes implicated in cardiac contractility has significant clinical
value [13]. A major limitation in using viral vectors is the existence
of endogenous neutralizing antibodies in human sera. In addition,
viral-mediated vectors are prone to entering of undesired cell and
tissue types when introduced intravenously or intramuscularly. To
successfully achieve high efficient delivery of key genes for therapeutics, choice of reliable gene delivery method is the foremost
critical step. Our approach to overcome such limitations is through
modulation of exosomes by targeted approach as a reliable gene
delivery system for the expression and function of miRNAs in
recipient cells. Indeed, exosomes offer unique advantage over several gene delivery systems for at least two reasons. One of that is
exosomes are natural carriers of biological information in the form
of miRNA and can deliver miRNA content to specific cell types via
receptor-mediated binding. Secondly, exosomes are rapidly taken
up by recipient cells, therefore minimal off-target effects are exhibited through systemic circulation.
Recent discoveries highlight that exosomes selectively carry
miRNAs in abundance and mediate crosstalk between different cell
types by direct transfer of miRNA in to recipient cells [14]. For
example, human CD34+ stem cell-derived exosomes carry miRNAs
that are implicated in proangiogenesis and ischemic tissue repair [15].

This natural exosomes-mediated communication can be harnessed
to deliver exogenous genetic material to further enhance the success and outcomes of gene therapy [16]. In this Chapter, we will
demonstrate how exosomes can be modulated using exogenous
Cy3 dye-labeled pre-miR miRNA precursors, which are miRNA
mimics that will enable direct transfer of pre-miR miRNA precursors into recipient cells via exosomes uptake (Fig. 1). Throughout
this protocol, we use Cy3 dye-labeled pre-miR miRNA precursors

to monitor exosomes uptake in real time using fluorescent imaging
technique. We further demonstrate using flow cytometry analysis
that human CD34+ stem cell-secreted exosomes predominantly
carry Cy3 dye-labeled pre-miR miRNA precursors. We then show
using fluorescent imaging that human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVEC) specifically uptake CD34+ stem cell exosomes containing Cy3 dye-labeled pre-miR miRNA precursors.

Cy3 dye-labeled pre-miR miRNA precursors must be protected
from light. Ensure that the tubes and cell culture flasks containing
Cy3 dye-labeled pre-miR miRNA precursors are protected from
light. Excessive exposure to light can interfere with the quality of
fluorescent imaging analysis.
1. On the day of transfection, collect media containing human
CD34+ stem cells. Ensure maximal cell recovery by gently
flushing new complete X-VIVO media into T75 flask and collect remaining cells.
2. Centrifuge the media containing CD34+ stem cells in 15 ml
polypropylene conical tubes at 400 × g for 7 min. Discard the
supernatant. This will remove the cell debris and exosomes
secreted during this period of cell culture.

3. To the cell pellet, add freshly prepared 1–2 ml X-VIVO 10
(complete) media and mix gently.
4. In a sterile 24-well culture plate, dilute Lipofectamine by mixing gently 150 μl Opti-MEM medium with 9 μl Lipofectamine
in one well. Prepare this mix in at least 8 wells of a 24-well
culture plate.
5. In a new well, dilute Cy3-labeled pre-miR miRNA precursors
in Opti-MEM medium by mixing gently 3 μl Cy3 pre-miR
(10 μM stock) with 150 μl Opti-MEM medium. Prepare this
mix separately in at least 8 wells.
6. Transfer diluted Lipofectamine (~159 μl) to each well containing Cy3 pre-miR (~153 μl) and mix gently.
7. Incubate the miRNA-lipid complex in room temperature for
5 min.
8. To each well containing Lipofectamine and Cy3 pre-miR mix,
add 1 ml of X-VIVO medium containing 250,000–300,000
human CD34+ stem cells. Swirl the 24-well plate gently to mix
contents.
9. Allow reverse transfection to occur by leaving cells in incubator

11. Centrifuge 50 ml polypropylene conical tubes containing
CD34+ stem cells at 400 × g for 7 min. Discard the supernatant.
This will remove the free Cy3 dye-labeled pre-miR miRNA precursors, non-transfected lipid-miRNA complexes, cell debris
and exosomes secreted during this period of cell culture.
12. To the cell pellet, add freshly prepared X-VIVO 10 (complete)
media and mix gently.
13. Plate these cells in a fresh T25 flask at a cell density of 250,000–
300,000 cells/ml using complete X-VIVO 10 medium.

orange indicate Cy3 dye-transfected human CD34+ stem cells (white arrows)

3. Spray 5 ml of 70 % ethanol alongside the inner walls of ultracentrifuge tubes and close the lid. Shake and invert several
times to wash all sides of the tube as well as the lid.
4. Aspirate out ethanol and leave the tubes open overnight inside
laminar flow chamber to let residual ethanol evaporate.
5. On the day of exosomes isolation, wash polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tubes using 5 ml of sterile PBS.
6. Turn on the ultracentrifuge (with the Ti70 rotor inside) and
chill to 4 °C with the “vacuum” mode. This will take approximately 2–3 h.
7. Set ultracentrifuge to 100,000 × g, time 60–75 min.
8. Following 30–36 h of Cy3-transfected human CD34+ stem
cell culture, collect transfected cells and conditioned media
together using serological pipette in a fresh 15 ml polypropylene conical tube.
9. In a small bench top low-speed centrifuge, place 15 ml polypropylene conical tube containing transfected CD34+ stem
cells and conditioned media and centrifuge at 500 × g for
10 min at 4 °C to separate cells from the conditioned media.
10. Carefully transfer the supernatant containing conditioned
media to a fresh 15 ml polypropylene conical tube and leave on
ice. Freeze the cell pellet at −80 °C or culture in fresh X-VIVO
10 (complete) media if required for further analysis.

Exosomes MicroRNA Delivery

147

11. Centrifuge the supernatant containing exosomes at 2000 × g
for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cell fragments and debris [17].
12. In a high-speed centrifuge, place the conical tubes containing
conditioned media and centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 20 min.
This will pellet large cell debris, apoptotic bodies and other
undesired extracellular vesicles leaving the soluble exosomes in
the supernatant. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a fresh
conical tube.
13. Prepare Tris/sucrose/D2O solution as follows
30 g protease- and nuclease-free sucrose.
2.4 g Tris base.
50 ml D2O.
Adjust pH to 7.4 with 10 N HCL drops.
Adjust volume to 100 ml with D2O.
Sterilize by passing through 0.22 μm filter.
Store up to 2 months at 4 °C.
14. Load 4 ml of ice-cold Tris/sucrose/D2O solution at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. This will make a cushion/floatation of exosomes.
15. Layer the supernatant containing exosomes from step 12 (of this
section) on top of the sucrose cushion. Layering must be done
gently without disturbing the sucrose cushion interface. Bring
the volume up to the neck of the tube. Balance tubes by adding
ice-cold PBS (w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+). Tighten the lids (see Note 1).
16. Ultracentrifuge the tubes at 100,000 × g for 60–75 min at 4 °C.
17. Remove supernatant and collect ~4 ml sucrose cushion, which
now contains exosomes. Only collect the sucrose cushion and
do not contaminate with pellet, if there is any.
18. Transfer the sucrose (~4 ml) to a fresh sterile polycarbonate
ultracentrifuge tube. Bring the volume up to the neck of the
tube using ice cold PBS (w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+). Balance tubes
by adding ice-cold PBS. Mix well. The mass of the tubes should
be within 0.03 g. Ensure the tubes are precisely balanced using
a bench top weighing balance.
19. Ultracentrifuge the tubes at 100,000 × g for 60–75 min at 4 °C.
20. The exosomes pellet is extremely fragile and easily disturbed by
minimal physical distractions and can lead to significant loss in
exosomes quantity. Therefore utmost care must be taken when
aspirating the supernatant leaving the exosomes pellet intact.
21. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 50–100 μl icecold PBS and carefully transfer to fresh sterile RNase/DNasefree eppendorf tubes.
22. Exosomes can be frozen for future experiments or can be used
immediately for downstream analysis.

3.4 Exosomes
Quality Analysis
and Preparation
for Gene Delivery

1. To avoid precipitation of undesired RNA molecules sticking
on to exosomal outer membranes, it is recommended to perform RNase A digestion of isolated exosomes sample.
2. Add RNase A enzyme to exosomal preparation at a 100 μg/ml
final concentration and mix gently.
3. Incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.
4. To avoid RNase A carryover throughout further steps, addition of RNase inhibitor is recommended.
5. Add RNase Inhibitor to the mixture 1 U/ml and incubate at
37 °C for 10 min.
6. In a fresh ultracentrifuge tube, load 4 ml of ice-cold Tris/
sucrose/D2O solution at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube.
7. Carefully layer the RNase A treated exosomes sample on top of
the sucrose cushion. Bring the volume up to the neck of the
tube. Balance tubes by adding ice-cold PBS (w/o Ca2+ and
Mg2+). Tighten the lids.
8. Ultracentrifuge the tubes at 100,000 × g for 60–75 min at 4 °C.
9. Remove supernatant and collect ~4 ml sucrose cushion, which
now contains exosomes. Only collect the sucrose cushion and
do not contaminate with pellet, if there is any.
10. Transfer the sucrose cushion (~4 ml) to a fresh sterile ultracentrifuge tube. Bring the volume up to the neck of the tube.
Balance tubes by adding ice-cold PBS (w/o Ca2+ and Mg2+).
Mix well.
11. Ultracentrifuge the tubes at 100,000 × g for 60–75 min at 4 °C.
12. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 50–100 μl icecold PBS and carefully transfer to fresh sterile RNase/DNasefree eppendorf tubes. To determine the intactness of exosomes
post-RNase treatment, dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis
can be performed (see Notes 2 and 3).
13. In a fresh sterile RNase/DNase-free eppendorf tube, aliquot
required volume of 4 μm latex beads (4 × 107 beads/ml). It is
recommended to use 200,000 beads per 1 × 106 cells.
14. Wash beads at least two times using FACS buffer (500 μl) and
pellet beads each time by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 4 min.
15. Resuspend beads in 100 μl FACS buffer and transfer to a fresh
eppendorf tube.
16. To the washed beads, add exosomes prepared from 2 × 106
CD34+ stem cells and mix gently.
17. Incubate at room temperature for at least 30 min. Without
rocking.
18. Transfer beads + exosomes mixture to a laboratory rocker and
incubate for additional 2 h with rocking (see Note 4).

Exosomes MicroRNA Delivery

19. Centrifuge bead-tagged exosomes at 8000 × g for 4 min.
20. Wash the bead-tagged exosomes pellet by adding 500 μl FACS
buffer and centrifugation at 8000 × g for 4 min.
21. Resuspend the pellet (beads + exosomes) in 200 μl FACS buffer.
22. Keep the beads + exosomes mixture on ice.
23. Perform flow cytometry (see Note 5).
Note that we recommend always including controls such as (1)
Beads only, (2) beads + unstained exosomes, and (3) beads + Cy3
miR-containing exosomes. All these are processed simultaneously and treated identically.
24. FACS analysis will ensure the quality of exosomes purification
as well as the enrichment of Cy3-tagged exosomes for downstream gene delivery protocols.
25. As shown in Fig. 3, we confirm efficient transfection of Cy3labeled pre-miR miRNA precursors to human CD34+ stem
cells and release of Cy3 miRNA via exosomes secretion. This
ensures that CD34+ stem cell-derived exosomes can be used
for targeted gene delivery.
1. To monitor Cy3-tagged exosomes uptake by fluorescent
microscopy, we used HUVEC cell line that constantly express
Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP).

4. Prepare a sterile 16-well chambered cover glass for exosomes
miRNA delivery.
5. Upon 70–80 % confluence, trypsinize GFP-expressing HUVEC
cells and perform cell counting by trypan blue staining.
6. Carefully transfer 2–3 × 104 GFP-expressing HUVEC cells to
16-well chambered cover glass.
7. Normalize exosomes volume to initial CD34+ stem cell number, i.e., it is recommended to use exosomes from 1 × 106
CD34+ stem cells per 2–3 × 104 GFP-expressing HUVEC cells.
For example, if exosomes were prepared from 3 × 106 CD34+
stem cells, use one-third of exosomes sample to transfect
2–3 × 104 GFP-expressing HUVEC cells in a 16-well chambered cover glass.
8. Cover the 16-well chambered cover glass.
9. Place the 16-well chambered cover glass in a dark cell culture
incubator capable of 37 °C, 5 % CO2 and 85 % relative
humidity.
10. Culture HUVECs in presence of exosomes for 12–24 h.
11. Exosomal uptake by HUVECs can be visualized live under a

Notes
1. Layering of exosomes sample on top of sucrose cushion needs
caution when performing. A minimal disruption to exosomessucrose interface can significantly affect exosomes quality and
quantity after ultracentrifugation. Such disruptions can introduce
unwanted protein and large lipid complexes as contaminants in
exosomes preparation thereby affecting exosomes purity.
2. If the exosomes sample is limited, exosomes sample used for
dynamic light scattering analysis can be reused for downstream
procedures such as RNA/protein/flow cytometry analysis.
3. During DLS analysis, if there is a significant proportion of particle size greater than 500 nm present, performing an additional sucrose-based gradient ultracentrifugation step is
recommended to further deplete contaminating larger
particles.
4. When incubating 4 μm beads with exosomes for uptake experiments with HUVECs, rocking should be performed with high
speed at room temperature. This is typically 50–60 RPM.
5. When performing flow cytometry, it is also recommended to
include a positive control by incubating 4 μm beads with Cy3
miRNA only. This control will assist in flow cytometry gating.

Lipidoid mRNA Nanoparticles for Myocardial
Delivery in Rodents
Irene C. Turnbull, Ahmed A. Eltoukhy, Daniel G. Anderson,
and Kevin D. Costa
Abstract
An area of active research in the field of cardiac gene therapy aims to achieve high transfection efficiency
without eliciting immune or inflammatory reactions. Nanomedicine offers an attractive alternative to traditional viral delivery vehicles because nanoparticle technology can enable safer and more controlled delivery of therapeutic agents. Here we describe the use of lipidoid nanoparticles for delivery of modified
mRNA (modRNA) to the myocardium in vivo, with a focus on rodent models that represent a first step
toward preclinical studies. Three major procedures are discussed in this chapter: (1) preparation of lipid
modRNA nanoparticles, (2) intramyocardial delivery of the lipid modRNA nanoparticles by direct injection with an open chest technique in rats, and (3) intracoronary delivery of the lipid modRNA nanoparticles with open chest and temporary aortic cross clamping in rats.

Introduction
Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary field that uses principles
from chemistry, biology, physics and engineering to design, fabricate and study nanoparticle structures, defined as having at least
one dimension in the 1–300 nm range. For biomedical applications, nanoparticles made using a variety of formulations, including polymers or lipid-based components, have been used to
encapsulate drugs, DNA and RNA [1, 2]. Lipid nanoparticles are
attractive as nonviral transfection agents, allowing delivery of
genetic material with temporally controlled release at high transfection rates. DNA and RNA carried in lipid nanoparticles also
exhibit lower degradation rates and higher likelihood of cellular
uptake compared to free nucleotides in solution [3]. In addition,
the use of synthetic modified mRNA (modRNA) incorporating
pseudouridine instead of uridine results in a lower degree of

translation inhibition [4]. We have recently combined lipid-based
nanoparticles and mod mRNA technologies, and demonstrated
highly efficient delivery and expression in myocardium of small and
large animal models (Fig. 1) [5].
To help make this technology accessible to other investigators,
herein we describe lipid-based nanoparticles containing modRNA
using a custom formulation consisting of an epoxide-derived lipidoid (mixed in ethanol with the stabilizers DSPC, cholesterol, and
PEG-DMG), added to modified mRNA (dissolved in citrate buffer) resulting in synthesis of formulated lipid nanoparticles (FLNP)
via nanoprecipitation. The nanoparticles are then purified by dialysis at 4 °C for 3 h. After the dialysis period, this synthesis process
renders formulated lipidoid/modRNA nanoparticles (FLNP/
modRNA) that can be maintained at 4 °C and remain stable for at
least 14 days from the time of synthesis; this stability is clearly
advantageous for future preclinical studies, since it allows for storage and transport of the nanoparticle solution to the facility where
it would be required.
We also describe two different routes of delivery to the heart,
which are applicable for rat in vivo studies: (1) intramyocardial
injection using a common open chest technique, and (2) intracoronary injection using temporary aortic cross clamping in an openchest preparation. Both have proven to be effective delivery
methods for virus-associated gene therapies to the heart [6], and
recently we showed their use for delivery of FLNP/ enhanced
green fluorescent protein (eGFP) modRNA [5]. There are variations of the cross-clamping technique, ranging from clamping the

aorta alone, aorta and pulmonary artery, and superior and inferior
vena cava [6–11]. Of particular interest is the intracoronary delivery route, for although it requires an invasive procedure for small
animal applications as described here, it serves to evaluate a method
of delivery that involves only a minimally invasive procedure by
percutaneous catheter-based intracoronary delivery in large animals and humans, which is appropriate in preclinical and translational studies.

Methods

3.1 Calculation
of Required Materials

Calculate the required quantities of each component, following
steps 1–6.
1. Establish the total amount of μg of mRNA that you plan to use
for injection(s). Based on that, the total formulation volume
(μl) is calculated for a final mRNA concentration of 0.1 mg/ml.
Total Formulation Volume (μl) = {total mRNA to be used (μg)}/
{final mRNA concentration (mg/ml)}.
2. Next, calculate the “required” volume of the organic lipid mixture (μl) and the aqueous mRNA mixture volume (μl) using the
following formulas (based on the 1:3 volumetric mixing ratio of
the organic lipid mixture to aqueous mRNA solution):
Required Volume of Organic Lipid Mixture (μl) = {Total
Formulation Volume (μl)} × (1/4).
Aqueous mRNA Mixture Volume (μl) = {Total Formulation
Volume (μl)} × (3/4).
3. Calculate the required volume of each of the organic lipid mixture components: C14-113 lipidoid, DSPC, Cholesterol, and
PEG-DMG at a working molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 and a
working concentration of 4 mg/ml, 1.168 mg/ml, 2.201 mg/
ml, and 0.567 mg/ml respectively; starting with a stock
concentration of 10 mg/ml for each of the components (see
step 1 of Subheading 2.1). Substitute the component in square
brackets by lipidoid, DSPC, Cholesterol, or PEG-DMG.
Total required volume of [lipidoid] (μl) = {working concentration of
[lipidoid] (mg/ml)} × {Total Required Volume of Organic Lipid
Mixture (μl)}/{stock concentration of [lipidoid] (mg/ml)}.

Nanoparticle Gene Delivery to the Heart

157

4. Calculate the required ethanol volume in which the lipidoid
components will be diluted.
Required ethanol volume (μl) = {Required Volume of Organic
Lipid Mixture (μl)} − {(required volume of lipidoid μl) + (required
volume of DSPC μl) + (required volume of Cholesterol
μl) + (required volume of PEG-DMG μl)}.
5. Calculate “scale up” volumes of each organic lipid mixture
component. It is important to always make more organic lipid
mixture than what is required so that at the time of synthesis
sufficient lipid solution is available (see Note 3). A scale-up factor of 2 is generally adequate; it can be adjusted as needed.
Scale up volume of [lipidoid] (μl) = {Total required volume of
[lipidoid] (μl)} × {scale up factor}.
The above calculations serve to specify the minimum stock
quantities required from each of the components of the organic
lipid mixture.
6. Based on a 10:1 mass ratio of C14-113 lipidoid to mRNA, and the
1:3 volumetric mixing ratio of the organic lipid mixture to aqueous mRNA solution, dilute the stock modRNA in citrate buffer as
needed. A stock concentration of 1 mg/ml is ideal; if substantially
below this concentration, mRNA can be concentrated by the standard protocol of nucleic acid precipitation and centrifugation
(using an RNAse-free mixture of sodium acetate buffer and ethanol). For a working concentration of 4 mg/ml of lipidoid, a working mRNA concentration of 0.133 mg/ml is needed, that is,
4 mg/ml lipidoid/(10 mg lipidoid/1 mg mRNA) × (1 ml lipidoid/3 ml mRNA). Using the given stock mRNA concentration,
the aqueous mRNA mixture volume, and the working mRNA
concentration, calculate the stock mRNA volume and citrate buffer volume required for the dilution as follows.
Stock mRNA volume (μl) = {Aqueous mRNA Mixture volume
(μl)} × {Working mRNA concentration (mg/ml)}/{Stock
mRNA concentration (mg/ml)}.
Citrate buffer volume (μl) = {Aqueous mRNA Mixture volume
(μl)} − {Stock mRNA volume (μl)}.
To organize the equations and easily perform the calculations
each time they are needed, we recommend creating an electronic
spreadsheet using the values and formulas shown in Fig. 2. An
example of the results from these calculations is shown in Fig. 3.
3.2 Preparation
of Formulated Lipidoid
modRNA Nanoparticles

1. Bring all stocks of the required components to room temperature (lipidoid, DSPC, PEG, and cholesterol) and make sure
they are well dissolved prior to use (see Note 4).
2. Prepare the organic lipid mixture. In a microcentrifuge tube, first
add the “scaled up” volume of ethanol, then add the “scaled up”
volumes of each of the four lipid components in the following
order: lipidoid, DSPC, cholesterol, and PEG-DMG. Mix by
pipetting several times after adding each component.

according to the planned experiments. Blue box: The output in this box is the required volume of organic lipid
mixture in microliters. Green box: The output in this box is the aqueous mRNA mixture volume in microliters

3. Prepare the aqueous mRNA mixture. In a microcentrifuge
tube, first add the citrate buffer, and then add the mRNA. Mix
by pipetting several times.
4. Synthesize formulated lipid nanoparticles/mRNA (FLNP/
mRNA). Add the “required volume” of the organic lipid mixture to the tube containing the aqueous mRNA mixture (1:3
volume/volume organic lipid–aqueous mRNA). Mix by
repeated pipetting for 15 s.
5. Leave undisturbed for 10 min at room temperature to allow
for self-assembly of FLNPs.

modRNA nanoparticles. Color coding same as Fig. 2

6. In a large glass beaker, add 3 l of 1× PBS and a magnetic stir bar.
Pre-wet the dialysis cassette membrane by immersion of the
dialysis cassette in the beaker for at least 2 min. Remove dialysis
cassette from the beaker and gently tap to remove excess fluid
(see Note 5). Cover the top of the beaker with aluminum foil.
Bring the beaker with the PBS and stir bar to a cold room (4 °C)
and place on a magnetic stir plate (see Note 6).
7. Dilute the FLNP/mRNA solution by adding 1× PBS as needed
and pipet to mix.

160

Irene C. Turnbull et al.

8. Collect the sample from the microcentrifuge tube (FLNP/
mRNA solution) into a 1-ml syringe with needle, leaving a
small amount of air in the syringe.
9. Mark one corner port of the dialysis cassette with a permanent
ink marker. Penetrate the gasket through a syringe guide port
at the marked corner and inject the sample into the dialysis cassette while holding it upright. Use caution, as inserting the
needle too far into the sample chamber may puncture the
membrane (see Note 7).
10. Place the dialysis cassette in the beaker with PBS on a stir plate.
Let it float vertically and set the stir plate to a low setting (gentle
stirring). Dialyze overnight (or for at least 3 h) at 4 °C (see Note
8). For dialysis volumes lower than 750 μl there is no need to
exchange the PBS dialysis buffer. For larger volumes, replace the
dialysis buffer with fresh 1× PBS once after the first 2 h.
11. Remove the dialysis cassette from the beaker. Penetrate gasket
with a new syringe and needle through the unused syringe
guide port (the one that is not marked) and slowly inject air
into the chamber to the maximum allowed volume to separate
the membranes, which helps prevent needle puncture of the
cassette membrane. With the needle in place, turn the cassette
upside down so that the needle is at the bottom, and as sample
collects near the port withdraw sample into the syringe.
12. Transfer the solution containing dialyzed FLNP/mRNA from
the syringe into a microcentrifuge tube. Measure the new volume
(post dialysis volume) (see Note 9) and adjust the concentration
accordingly to calculate the volume/dose to be injected. Maintain
the formulation at 4 °C until ready for use (see Note 10).
3.3 Intramyocardial
Delivery of the Lipid
mRNA Nanoparticles
by Direct Injection
in Rats

1. Calculate in advance of the procedure the total volume (μl) of
FLNP/modRNA required for delivering the desired full dose of
mRNA (μg). Bring the FLNP/modRNA to the procedure
room and keep on ice until ready for use (step 6). As described
below, the total volume will be delivered in multiple injections.
2. Anesthetize the rat by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/
zylaxine (60–80 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively). Shave the
chest.
3. Once the animal is sedated, cannulate the trachea with a 16 G
or 18 G (1¼″–2″ length) IV catheter (see Note 11), and connect to a mechanical ventilator providing room air (70–90
breaths/min) (see Note 12). Place animal in right lateral position, and secure the animal by the limbs to the operating board
with adhesive tape. Use a heating pad to maintain a body temperature of 37 °C. Wipe the chest with povidone-iodine
solution.

(marks) on either side of the silk sutures. Arrows point to loosely tied silk sutures used as landmarks; and (b)
schematic illustrates the lengthwise cut (dashed line) through the 6-0 silk sutures placed as landmarks, splitting the heart in two to use one half for histology and the other for RNA extraction

4. Perform a left thoracotomy between the fourth and fifth ribs.
Place a self-retaining retractor in the fourth intercostal space
to stretch open the thorax. Incise the pericardium to expose
the heart.
5. Thread two 6-0 silk sutures (with taper point needle) on the
exposed left ventricular free wall of the heart and tie them
loosely (Fig. 4a) (see Note 13). These sutures are to be placed
superficially, avoiding the coronary vessels, and will serve as
reference markers at the time of injection and also during subsequent tissue harvest (see Note 14).
6. Load the total amount of FLNP/modRNA to be delivered
into a 1-ml syringe with a 25 G × 5 8 ″ needle. Change needle to
a 30 G × ½″–1″ needle. Approach the heart surface with the
needle at a shallow angle (30–45°) relative to the epicardial
surface, advance the needle along the free wall of the heart (see
Note 15). Inject the solution as you retract the needle.
Distribute the injections on the anterior, apical and lateral
regions of the heart to the left and right of the silk sutures
placed as reference, administering 40–100 μl per injection site
(see Note 16).
7. To close, first bring the rib cage together with interrupted
sutures, and then the muscular and fascia layer with running
sutures. Lastly suture close the skin (see Note 17).
8. Allow the animal to recover while being maintained connected
to the ventilator until the animal is able to breath spontaneously, without signs of labored breathing.
9. For analgesia, administer buprenorphine 0.1–0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous, twice a day for 3 days.

3.4 Intracoronary
Delivery of the
Formulated Lipid
mRNA Nanoparticles
by Intraventricular
Injection with
Temporary Aortic
Cross Clamping in
Rats

1. Anesthetize and prep the animal as described in the previous
section on intramyocardial injection (steps 1–3), with the
exception that the rat is placed in a supine rather than lateral
position, and the FLNP/modRNA are delivered in a single
injection.
2. Make a skin incision (approximately 1.5-cm long) on the chest
along the midline; continue the incision through the subcutaneous tissue. The heart can be approached through a mid sternotomy, or alternatively a left distal parasternal approach (see
Note 18).
3. Incise the pericardium to expose the heart. Apply a cephalad retraction to the thymus and identify the aorta and pulmonary artery.
4. Partially exteriorize the heart by gently advancing a cotton
tipped applicator from the apex towards the underside of the
heart (see Note 19). Place a 6-0 silk suture (with taper point
needle) at the apex as a purse string, without tying it. Introduce
a 24 G × ¾″ catheter through the left ventricular apex at the
center of the purse string. Immediately upon gaining access to
the left ventricle, remove the needle, watch for blood return
and connect the catheter to a 1-ml syringe containing the
FLNP/modRNA solution to be injected.
5. Advance the catheter to the aortic root; it is likely that the catheter will be visualized below the surface of the aortic wall as it
advances into the ascending aorta. Proceed cautiously to avoid
puncturing the wall of the aorta. Then retract the catheter slightly
to leave the tip of the catheter at the base of the aortic root.
6. Place an atraumatic clamp (a padded clamp can be used) across
the ascending aorta just distal to the aortic root (Fig. 5) (see
Note 20). Inject the FLNP/modRNA solution into the aortic
root while the heart is pumping against a closed system, this
allows the solution to circulate down the coronary arteries and
perfuse the heart without direct manipulation of the coronaries (see Note 21). After 30 s of aortic cross clamping, release
the clamp (see Note 22).
7. Withdraw the catheter and immediately tie the purse string
suture on the apex of the heart to seal the catheter puncture
site. Apply a cotton tipped applicator to the puncture site to
aid stopping of bleeding.
8. Close the chest by first bringing together the edges of the sternum, and then the muscular and fascia layer in the midline.
Lastly, suture close the skin layer (see Note 17).
9. Release the animal from the restrains while maintaining connected to the ventilator until the animal is able to breath spontaneously, without signs of labored breathing.
10. For analgesia administer buprenorphine 0.1–0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous, twice a day for 3 days (see Note 23).

Notes
1. Weigh the dried lipids into tared vials and add ethanol. Use a
vortex-mixer to ensure complete dissolution. If the lipids do not
dissolve, heat to 37 °C until the solution becomes transparent.
2. Aliquot and store mRNA at −70 °C. For use, thaw the required
aliquot(s) of mRNA on ice. Always wear gloves and use RNAsefree tips and tubes when handling mRNA to avoid RNA degradation. We strongly recommend the use of modified mRNA,
which incorporates both pseudouridine and 5-methylcytidine
modified nucleotides, reducing the innate immune response to
RNA [13–15].
3. When mixing the lipid components, make a volume larger than
the minimum required; we recommend a 200 % increase to
ensure a sufficient amount of the required organic lipid mixture to add to the aqueous mRNA mixture (step 4 of
Subheading 3.2). It also helps to increase the working volumes
when the required minimum of any of the components is
impractically small (e.g., less than 1 μl).
4. When lipids are brought to room temperature, some particulates of the lipids will be visible. To dissolve the lipids properly
for use, place in water bath at 37 °C while shaking for 1–2 min

164

Irene C. Turnbull et al.

and then vortex intermittently. Check that the lipids are well
dissolved; no particles should be visible. Repeat as needed.
5. The beaker containing the PBS can be prepared beforehand,
prior to bringing lipids to room temperature, but the best time
to pre-wet the dialysis cassette membrane is during the 10-min
incubation period for FLNP self-assembly.
6. To avoid malfunction of electronics due to condensation, it is
recommended that the stir plate be brought to the cold room
at least 24 h prior to its use.
7. Slowly advance the needle into the dialysis cassette cavity so
that the sharp tip of the needle is barely visible. Inserting the
needle too far into the cassette chamber may puncture the dialysis membrane and render it useless. Inject approximately half
of the sample. Withdraw some air from the cassette by pulling
back on the syringe piston and then inject remaining sample.
With the needle in the cassette cavity, withdraw remaining air
to compress the chamber windows to allow maximum contact
of the sample with membrane surface area, maximizing the
dialysis efficiency. Always use caution to prevent the needle
from contacting the membrane.
8. Dialysis is required for 3 h but it can be extended to overnight,
as convenient for the scheduled experiments, e.g., timing of
the surgical procedures for injection of the FLNP/
modRNA. The longer period of dialysis is not detrimental to
the formulation.
9. To measure the post-dialysis volume, collect the entire volume
of the sample into the 1-ml syringe and measure the volume
according to the graduation marks on the syringe.
10. Successful transfection of myocardium in vivo was achieved
when the FLNP/modRNA was injected within the first 24 h
after preparation. However, in vitro tests showed that the formulation remains stable and retains activity for at least 14 days
when stored at 4 °C [5].
11. Prepare the catheter prior to use by cutting off the sharp end
of needle, a wire cutter is the ideal tool, and exercise caution to
avoid personal injury when cutting the needle tip.
12. Ventilator settings must be adjusted per individual animal, with
respiratory rate 70–90 breaths/min and inspiration time
0.4–0.6 s.
13. Reference markers are required when performing the procedure in a sham animal to later identify the sites of nanoparticle
injection; such landmarks may not be required when injecting
the nanoparticles into the heart of an animal with a clearly
defined ischemic region, e.g., post LAD ligation.
14. The procedure of organ harvest must be carried out expeditiously to avoid tissue degradation. Label tubes and cryomolds

beforehand. To process heart tissue from animals that received
direct intramyocardial injection, harvest the heart and rinse in
PBS (avoid perfusion with fixative), cut the heart in half lengthwise through the 6-0 silk sutures placed as landmarks (Fig. 4b).
One half, to be used for RNA extraction, should be cut into
≤1 mm3 pieces, collect into a DNAse/RNAse free microcentrifuge tube and store at −80 °C until ready for processing. The
other half is to be used for histology; place tissue sample in
cryomold, embed in optimum cutting temperature (OCT)
compound, place on dry ice, and once the OCT freezes store
at −80 °C until ready for cryosectioning. Apply fixative to each
cryosection prior to staining.
15. As you advance the needle the bevel should be parallel to the
surface of the heart to avoid puncturing through the full thickness of the myocardium and into the ventricular chamber.
16. The recommended maximum volume at any single injection
point is 100 μl.
17. The recommended suture sizes are 3-0 to 4-0, and 5-0 for skin
layer. For the type of suture material, use slowly absorbed or
nonabsorbable suture material, avoid using silk for skin closure.
18. For the parasternal approach, cut off the most distal two ribs
from their attachment to the left side of the sternum, and then
advancing proximally, cut off the next two ribs on the right
side of the sternum, and lastly cut through the sternum diagonally. Place a self-retaining retractor to bring apart the distal
part of the sectioned sternum towards the right and the proximal part of the sternum to the left.
19. Applying external pressure on the right side of the thorax can
also help to exteriorize the heart.
20. The procedure that includes clamping of the pulmonary artery
along with aorta is expected to result in a wider distribution of
particles throughout the myocardium [6].
21. While one person alone without assistants performs most
rodent surgeries, it is recommended that for this particular
technique one person takes control of the clamp on the aorta
while an assistant applies the injection. Once sufficient proficiency is acquired with the technique it may be performed by
one person alone.
22. It is expected that during the cross clamping the heart rate will
decrease, but it should recover to baseline within 30 s of clamp
release. The general recommendation for a maximum volume
to be delivered is to not exceed 500 μl due to risk of pulmonary edema [8]; we have delivered up to 600 μl in the rat
without overt compromise of heart or lung function and with
animal survival for at least 2 weeks, which was the longest time
point at which the animals were euthanized [5].

23. It is expected that recovery from the sternotomy will induce
greater discomfort for the animal than the left thoracotomy
used for the direct injection, thus requiring adjustment of
buprenorphine dosage for appropriate analgesia.

Gene Transfer in Isolated Adult Cardiomyocytes

Abstract
During the past few decades, gene delivery using recombinant virus has made tremendous progress. With
a higher than 80 % transduction efficiency, even in non-dividing cells, viral transduction has become the
method of choice for efficient gene transfer into cardiomyocytes. However, in vitro gene delivery is dependent on a robust cell isolation protocol, as prolonged cultivation is needed to initiate gene expression and
target specific cellular processes. This chapter describes some of the important steps that need to be considered for successful in vitro gene transfer into adult cardiomyocytes. Included are detailed protocols for
isolating cells, maintaining rod shaped cardiomyocytes in culture over several days, and employing adenovirus for gene transduction.

1 Introduction
Combined with cellular electrophysiology and imaging techniques
on single isolated cardiomyocytes, gene transfer is an invaluable
tool for investigating cellular physiology. In non-dividing cells like
adult cardiomyocytes, efficient gene transfer using conventional
transfection techniques like calcium phosphate [1–4], or liposome/Lipofectamine [5–8] has proved to be challenging (reviewed
in [9]). Even in neonatal cardiomyocytes, transfection efficiency is
usually low with these techniques, with values reported near 6 % [6,
7]. The low transfection efficiency in non-dividing cells has made
viral gene transduction the preferred method for delivering genetic
material into these cells.
1.1 Selecting
a Viral Vector

To date, several recombinant (non-virulent) viruses including adenovirus (AV), adeno-associated virus (AAV) and lentivirus (LV)
have been shown to efficiently deliver exogenous genetic material
into adult cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo [10–14]. However,
the viruses differ in terms of their viral backbone, insert size,
infection strategy and transcription efficiency (Table 1). These

Cloning capacity is dependent on the viral capsid and the amount of genomic material that needs to be carried for efficient

a

variations provide several different options for the researcher and
choosing the right virus depends on the experimental objective(s).
AV has several advantages when performing in vitro overexpression- or knockdown (short hairpin (sh)RNA/small interfering
(si)RNA)—experiments. The double-stranded (ds)DNA backbone
found in AV facilitates direct transcription and limits the time
required for cardiomyocyte cultivation. In addition, AV allows for
larger inserts up to 8 kb long (AV serotype 5 with the early transcribed region E1 and E3 deleted). However, AV does not result in
incorporation of the transgene into the host genome, meaning that
gene expression is limited to approximately 2 weeks in isolated cells
[15–18]; a fact that limits the applicability of AV for in vivo use.
Another potential drawback of using AV is the strong immune
response induced by the virus, although parallel experiments with
empty vector can help control for these effects.
AAV transduction induces little immune response and can provide stable gene expression in cardiac cells for up to 1 year [19].
These benefits make these viruses well suited for in vivo work, and
studies wishing to combine in vitro and in vivo techniques. In
addition, a variety of serotypes (surface markers) with different tropism are available (e.g., [20–22]). The DNA backbone of traditional AAV is single-stranded and to efficiently transcribe the DNA
template the cell needs to perform a second-strand synthesis to
make readable dsDNA [23]. This process creates a transcriptional
delay and, as a result, in vitro cultivation needs to be prolonged. A
novel method has been developed to overcome this transcriptional
delay. The so-called self-complementary (sc)AAV has been shown
to facilitate transcription without the need of second-strand
­synthesis, allowing for faster onset of transcription compared to

Gene Transduction in Cardiomyocytes

conventional AAV [24]. Despite improvements in its transcriptional
activity, a major drawback of using AAV is the limited insert size of
3 kb (+1 kb promoter).
As with AAV, LV cannot be directly transcribed following
transduction. Rather, the single-stranded RNA of these viruses
depends on reverse transcriptase to generate a transcription-­
competent dsDNA template. Because LV induces less of an
immune response than AV, and can carry larger inserts than AAV,
LV may be particularly practical for in vivo research. Moreover, LV
can incorporate into the host genome and the long-term effect of
LV has made this virus attractive for potential therapy.
1.2 Overview of Viral
Transduction
Techniques

In vitro gene delivery is dependent on a healthy, quiescent population of isolated cardiomyocytes. Thus, successful cell isolation is
crucial and, in our experience, this begins with careful animal handling. As with all techniques using animal models, it is essential to
reduce the stress on the animal at all times, as it can affect downstream processes of interest. In particular, the heart is highly sensitive to neurohumoral transmission and elevated respiratory
metabolism, two factors that are altered as a result of elevated stress.
The importance of a well-practiced and reproducible cell isolation protocol cannot be overstated. The most commonly used protocol for cell isolation is the Langendorff technique [25, 26].
Following surgical removal, the intact heart is cannulated through
the aorta and perfused retrogradely using either constant pressure
perfusion (gravity feed) or constant flow (pump feed) of fresh, oxygenated cell isolation solution (Fig. 1). The pressure created by the
reverse flow causes the aortic valve to close and directs the isolation
solution through the coronary arteries. If mounted rapidly and
correctly, ischemic conditions in the heart are minimized, the myocardium remains viable, and digestive enzymes are uniformly distributed [9]. Full details of the cell isolation method are outlined
in the following sections.
Following isolation, stable cell cultivation is required for an
extended time period (>48 h) to enable successful gene delivery. In
general, two strategies for cultivation exist; namely the redifferentiation and rapid attachment methods. With the redifferentiation
method, cardiomyocytes lose their rod shaped structure within
24 h following isolation and produce pseudopodia-like structures
when attached to the surface of the culture dish. These cells also
start to contract spontaneously (e.g., [27–29]). Although, this is a
useful method for investigating, for example, genetic reprogramming, most studies would benefit from cells with morphological
[rod shaped with a regular transverse (t) tubule network] and electromechanical properties highly resembling those found in freshly
isolated cells. When applied correctly, the rapid attachment cell
culture method can produce such myocytes [30], although some
degradation of cardiomyocyte morphology and function over time

Fig. 1 Langendroff setup for ventricular cardiomyocyte isolation. With the Langendorff technique, the heart is
mounted on a cannula via the aorta, and retrogradely perfused with solutions that are either gravity-fed (constant pressure perfusion) or pump-fed (constant flow perfusion). Cardiomyocyte isolation is accomplished by
including enzymes in the perfusate, with careful regulation of temperature and extracellular [Ca2+], as detailed
in the methods protocols. Reproduced from ref. [9] with permission

seems to be inevitable ([9] and Fig. 2). Inclusion of growth
medium is widely reported to minimize run-down of cell quality
over time, possibly by strengthening plasma membranes [31], and
to promote cell adherence to the bottom of the culture vessel [30].
Indeed, serum inclusion has become standard procedure in most
protocols for mammalian cell culture. However, cardiomyocytes
are not normally in direct contact with serum in vivo, and investigators should be aware that its precise effects on cultured cardiomyocytes are not completely understood. Addition of taurine,
l-carnitine, and creatine to the culture medium have also been
shown to improve cell maintenance, and several protocols have
included the use of insulin and exclusion of l-glutamine (when not
adding serum) [32, 33]. Lastly, in accordance with Tian and colleagues [34], we found that adding submicromolar cytochalasin D
(cyto D) helped preserve the t-tubule network during extended
cultivation periods (Fig. 2).

time-dependent disruption of t-tubule structure. (b) Representative rat cardiomyocyte transduced with an
adenovirus construct that drives green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. The t-tubule network was visualized by co-staining with 12.5 μM RH237 (Thermo Fisher) for 15 min

Detailed protocols for successful adenoviral gene transfer are
outlined in the following sections, starting with advanced preparation of materials and equipment, and including required methods
for cell isolation and culture. These protocols are based on both
previous published work and our own developed methods.

3.2.2 Day 1: Isolation
and Seeding

Isolation Protocol
1. Thaw BSA solution, and keep on ice along with CIS, collagenase, and DNase.
2. Aerate CIS solution with medical-grade O2 (approximately
10 min for 1 l solution).
3. Prepare following solutions and maintain at 37 °C:
–– CIS/BSA: 28.5 ml CIS + 1.5 ml BSA solution.
–– 0.1 mM Ca2+: 14.25 ml CIS + 750 ml BSA solution + 1.5 μl
1 M CaCl2.
Additionally, aliquot enough CIS for step 13 and warm to at
least room temperature.
4. Prepare 2 mg/ml collagenase solution by mixing 50 mg collagenase in 25 ml CIS, and add 4 μl 0.1 M CaCl2 to activate
the enzyme.
5. Prime the Langendorff apparatus (see Fig. 1) with the collagenase and CIS solutions.
6. Adult rats are anesthetized in a chamber filled with 5 % isoflurane (Abbott Scandinavia Ab, Solna, Sweden) and a 95 % mixture of N2O and O2. Hearts are quickly excised by thoracotomy
and placed in ice cold 0.15 M NaCl solution containing
roughly 1 ml of heparin (see Notes 5–7).
7. Trim away excess tissue so that the aorta is easily accessible;
hang heart on appropriately sized cannula and fasten around
remaining aorta with sutures.
8. Start perfusion with Langendorff apparatus. If using a constant-­
flow set-up, adjust pump speed so that flow rate is 3 ml/min
(1 drop per 1.8 s). Perfuse heart with CIS until clear of blood
(see Note 8).
9. Switch to collagenase solution and digest for 10–12 min from
the time the collagenase reaches the cannulated heart (this time
can vary and it is advisable to optimize all newly ordered batches
of collagenase); recycle the collagenase solution as needed.
10. Once digested, the myocardium becomes pale and soft. When
approaching this point, let sufficient circulating collagenase
solution accumulate in a disposable vessel. Cut down the heart
and submerge in collagenase solution. Trim away the left and
right atria and right ventricle; divide the remaining left ventricle into small pieces (3–4 mm3).
11. Use thin-tipped forceps to tease the left ventricular tissue apart,
thereby increasing the amount of surface area exposed for secondary digestion.

12. Transfer approximately 8 ml of tissue and collagenase solution
to a 10 ml Falcon tube containing 0.2 mg DNase in 500 μl
BSA. Pipette up and down GENTLY with a plastic pipette (see
Note 9) to free additional cells from tissue.
13. Filter cell suspension through SEFAR Nitex® open mesh fabric
with a pore size of 255 μm (see Note 10). Adjust filtered cell
suspension to a volume of 10 ml with pre-warmed CIS.
14. Allow cells to pellet, then wash out the remaining collagenase
solution by removing most of the supernatant and rinsing the cell
pellet with the CIS/BSA solution followed by the 0.1 mM Ca2+
solution. Avoid disturbing the cell pellet as much as possible.
15. Allow cells to acclimatize for 10 min, then gradually increase
[Ca2+] by adding the following amounts of 1 M CaCl2 directly
to the cell suspension (per 10 ml cell suspension; allow cells to
acclimatize between each increase):
●●

1.0 μl = 0.2 mM Ca2+.

●●

3.0 μl = 0.5 mM Ca2+.

●●

5.0 μl = 1.0 mM Ca2+.

16. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in ACMM
containing 1 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) before plating.
Cell Seeding
17. Count the cell density with a hemocytometer (e.g., a Bürker
chamber) (see Note 11).
18. Seed cells at a density between 5.0 × 103 and 1.0 × 104 cells/
cm2 (e.g., for a 6-well plate: 4.75 × 104–9.5 × 104 cells per well).
19. Use a microscope to check the confluency of the seeded cells,
then allow to attach for 30 min–1 h.
20. Once cells are attached, replace growth medium with ACMM
lacking serum. When exchanging, gently swirl medium around
wells to remove as many dead/unattached cells as possible.
21. If virally transducing cells, change to serum-free medium and
add vector(s) at desired multiplicity of infection (MOI, see
Note 12).
22. Incubate cells at 37 °C and 5 % CO2; exchange growth medium
every 24 h.
23. If using fluorescently tagged constructs, check for expression
of your fluorophores 24–48 h following transduction.

4 Notes
1. Make sure that the water used is pure. Normally, MilliQ water
(MQ) with resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm is adequate. Depending
on the tubing mounted to the filtration system, fungus, bacteria,

178

Kjetil Hodne et al.

molds, etc. may be present in the water. Thus, autoclaving
should also be considered. All bottles and tubes used in the
Langendorff apparatus should also be autoclaved. Between each
use the Langendorff apparatus should be cleaned using 70 %
ethanol. If possible the cell isolation should be conducted inside
a biosafety cabinet with HEPA filter.
2. In a typical Langendorff apparatus used for isolating cardiomyocytes [25], tubing leads perfusate (CIS) from a solution
reservoir down to a cannula (Fig. 1). The temperature is regulated via a heating coil that surrounds the perfusion tubing.
The heart is mounted via the aorta and depending on the size
of the aorta the cannula must be carefully chosen (for mice
between 22 and 16 gauge (0.6–1.3 mm) and for rats from 14
to 8 gauge (1.6–3.2 mm)). The cannula can be made from
glass or metal. A groove near the bottom of the cannula may
aid in securing the aorta if a ligature is to be used.
3. In order to have stable conditions when chemically dissociating the cells, different lots of collagenase should be tested
before the experiment. Worthington provides an online system
where several different lots can be ordered and tested before
ordering larger stocks. Typically, three different lots are tested.
In addition, if using modified (e.g., genetically, banded,
infarcted) animals the collagenase treatment should be tested
on these animals as well. Choose the collagenase that maximizes cell yield and quality.
4. Slowly dissolve the BSA in a glass beaker with a magnetic stir
bar. Too much agitation will cause a large amount of foam to
form, which makes subsequent volume measurements difficult.
5. The protocol described has been optimized for male and
female Wistar rats (Møllergaard Breeding and Research Center,
Skensved, Denmark) weighing between 150 and 230 g. It is
important to minimize the stress experienced by the animals as
it can affect the neurohumoral state of the cells. Animals can
also be anesthetized using injectable (pentobarbital, ketamine/
xylazine) anesthetics [35–37]. However, some reports have
demonstrated that inhalable anesthetics may be preferable in
small animals as they avoid potential myocardial ischemia [38].
6. When operating animals, make sure to use clean, well-­
maintained surgical equipment. Lay the anesthetized animal
on its back, exposing its ventral side. Using surgical scissors,
remove a small patch of skin/fur from just below the rib cage.
Cut through the muscle so as to expose the top of the liver and
the diaphragm. Make a small incision on one side of the diaphragm, and cut across the body, detaching the diaphragm
from the rib cage (take care to avoid the heart). Cut through
the ribs towards the anterior end of the animal, and lift the rib
cage in order to expose the lungs and heart. Carefully pierce

Gene Transduction in Cardiomyocytes

179

the pericardium and remove from around the heart. Using
curved forceps, clamp the ascending aorta just below the aortic
arch while gently lifting the heart to better expose the aorta.
Using sharp, small scissors, cut the aorta just above the forceps,
then quickly clip all other circulatory vessels and transfer the
heart to ice-cold CIS. Avoid accidentally puncturing or cutting
the heart during all steps.
7. Animals can also be injected with heparin (400–5000 u/kg
body weight) 10–20 min before the anesthetization to prevent
blood clotting and possible myocardial infarction [35, 37, 39,
40]. We recommend making an injectable heparin solution by
diluting stock heparin in 0.9 % NaCl at a 1:5 ratio.
8. Sufficient perfusion of the coronary arteries is crucial during
adult rodent cardiomyocyte isolation. The cannula should be
carefully inserted into the ascending aorta, making sure not to
puncture the aortic valve. If properly positioned, the incoming
perfusate will cause the aortic valve to close, and thereby be circulated through the coronary arteries. This process is easily monitored, as the larger coronary arteries are clearly visible in rodent
hearts. If the blood remaining in the arteries following excision
does not clear during perfusion, then either try repositioning the
cannula or take down the heart and reattempt cannulation.
9. When titrating tissue, it is recommended to use a graduated
Pasteur pipette. In order to prevent additional shearing forces
on the cells, use scissors to remove the lower portion of the
pipette tip so that the digested tissue chunks fit through the
enlarged opening.
10. Cut out a small (roughly 5–6 cm2) piece of SEFAR Nitex®
Open Mesh Fabric and fold into a funnel shape.
11. Adult cardiomyocytes are large cells and may get caught in the
small opening between the base of the hemocytometer and the
coverslip. It is therefore recommended to place a small volume
of cell suspension (roughly 5 μl) directly over the grid etched
in the base of the hemocytometer. Afterwards, gently sit the
coverslip over each grid and secure as tightly as possible. Count
the total number of cells according to the instructions provided with your hemocytometer of choice. We found that the
cardiomyocytes adhere faster by adding 1 % serum to the culture medium for 1 h prior to further cultivation without serum
(similar to ref. [41]).
12. Care must be taken when optimizing your working virus concentration. The virus titer is provided with all commercially
ordered viruses and is typically listed as either PFU (plaque
forming unit) or IFU (infectious unit), which reflects the number of live/infectious virus particles in suspension. This measurement, along with the total number of cells seeded in culture, can
be used to calculate the multiplicity of infection (MOI):

180

Kjetil Hodne et al.

MOI =

Number of active virus particles
Number of cells in culture

The MOI describes how many live virus particles are available
to each cell in your culture. As an example, if your virus titer is
1.0 × 109 IFU/ml and you add 10 μl of stock virus suspension
to 1.0 × 106 cells, the MOI is calculated as follows:
Number of active virus particles = Titer ´ Added volume of stock virus

Number of active virus particles = 1.0 ´ 109

IFU
´ 0.010 ml
ml

Number of active virus particles = 1.0 ´ 107
Therefore:
MOI =

Number of active virus particles
1.0 ´ 107
MOI =
MOI = 10
Number of cells in culture
1.0 ´ 106

Assuming Poisson distribution (i.e., that all cells are equally susceptible to infection), an MOI of 10 would be sufficient to infect
99 % of all cells in culture. This can be assumed for most clonal
cell lines, however, may not necessarily be the case for a primary
cell line like adult cardiomyocytes. Therefore, it is imperative
that this value be optimized for each experiment as infectivity
can also be influenced by factors like cell density and volume of
culture medium. Keep in mind that in order to determine transfection efficiency you need a reporter like green fluorescent protein (GFP; ~715 bp, Fig. 2b) in addition to the promoter and
poly(A) tail signal. These modifications minimize the cloning
capacity further. However, to avoid using long bicistronic cloning vectors with Internal Ribosomal Entry Site (IRES) when
expressing two genes, a novel strategy using a self-­cleaving 2A
peptide sequence may be used (for details see refs. [42, 43]).

Gene Transfer in Cardiomyocytes Derived
from ES and iPS Cells

Abstract
The advent of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has produced patient-specific
hiPSC derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) that can be used as a platform to study cardiac diseases and
to explore new therapies.
The ability to genetically manipulate hiPSC-CMs not only is essential for identifying the structural
and/or functional role of a protein but can also provide valuable information regarding therapeutic applications. In this chapter, we describe protocols for culture, maintenance, and cardiac differentiation of
hiPSCs. Then, we provide a basic procedure to transduce hiPSC-CMs.

Introduction
Gene transfer is defined as a technique to efficiently and stably
introduce foreign genes into the genome of target cells [1]. This
technique is essential not only for studying the structural and/or
functional role of a gene/protein but also as a novel approach
for the investigation and potential treatment of a variety of diseases, including cardiac disease [2–7]. Studies in isolated cardiomyocytes have increasingly employed gene transfer technology
to investigate the mechanisms regulating myocyte structure and
function, providing significant insights into Ca2+ cycling and the
role played by individual sarcomeric proteins in modulating contractile function [7–11]. Gene delivery to cardiomyocytes is currently of interest as a treatment approach in cardiovascular
disease, and targeted genetic alteration strategies established in
single myocytes are now being investigated for their efficacy
in vivo [12–18]. Current preclinical platforms for evaluating
gene therapy approach often use animal models, which can be

inaccurate predictors of human cardiac pathophysiology due to
interspecies differences in cardiac structure, electrophysiology,
and gene expression [19–21].
Indeed, despite positive results from numerous preclinical
studies in animal models of cardiovascular diseases [7, 16, 17, 22,
23], the translational progress into clinical practice has been
remarkably slow.
Therefore, there is a critical need for using “human-based”
cellular platforms to better investigate gene transfer/delivery processes in order to validate the potential of gene therapies, not only
in animal models but also in “human” derived cardiomyocytes.
Due to the fact that human cardiac tissues are difficult to obtain,
cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCCMs), including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) [24, 25], may offer a valuable tool for
gene therapy studies.
The ability to differentiate hPSCs in a directed manner has
progressed considerably in the past 10 years and a substantial effort
has been made to develop strategies to efficiently and reliably direct
stem cell differentiation to the cardiovascular lineage [26, 27].
hPSC-CMs, in particular hiPSCs-CMs, can be used as a human
model to study cardiac disease [28–30] which implies also the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of different processes, and
importantly gene therapy. Recently, the effectiveness of gene delivery systems in hPSC-CMs has been revealed and viral vectors that
can be used to genetically manipulate the hESC/hiPSC system
have been identified [31]. Our laboratory routinely produces
hPSC-CMs and utilizes viral-mediated gene transfer. Here, we
describe in detail our current experimental protocols for culturing
hESC/iPSCs, cardiac differentiation of hESC/iPSCs and gene
transfer into hPSC-CMs.

Perform all steps under a sterile tissue culture hood.

3.1 Feeder-Free
Cultivation of Human
Pluripotent Stem Cells

In order to propagate hPSCs successfully, cultures must be serially
passaged when colonies become large and near-confluent by dissociation into small cell aggregates and seeding onto new plates
(see Note 4). The following protocol is a new, enzymatic-free alternative for passaging hPSCs, using DPBS 1×, without Ca2+/Mg2+.

3.1.1 Preparation
of Matrigel-Coated 6-Well
Plates

1. Thaw one aliquot of the hESC qualified Matrigel slowly at 4 °C
in the fridge (~1–2 h), and dilute it in a conical 50 ml tube that
contains 24 ml of DMEM/F12. Mix well in sterilized tissue culture hood immediately before coating 6-well plates.
2. Add 1 ml per well of the diluted Matrigel ensuring that the
whole surface is covered with a liquid film (1 aliquot of the
hESC qualified matrix is sufficient to coat four 6-well plates).
3. Allow hESC qualified Matrigel to set for 30 min at room temperature under the hood. Use plates immediately, or if desired,
store at 4 °C immediately after plating for up to 1 week and
equilibrate to room temperature for 30 min prior to use.

PSC-CMs Gene Transfer
3.1.2 Passaging
and Maintenance
of Human Pluripotent Stem
Cells (hPSCs)

187

1. Thaw mTeSR™1 5× Supplement (see Note 5) and add to
400 ml of mTeSR™1 Basal Media. Mix thoroughly. Filter
using a 0.2 μm low-protein binding filter and use immediately
or store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.
2. Maintain hPSCs in culture in 6-well plates and use 2 ml/well
of mTeSR®1 media. Prepare the desired volume of mTeSR®1
with ROCK inhibitor.
3. If stored at 4 °C, warm the prepared Matrigel coated plates to
room temperature by placing them in sterilized tissue culture
hood for at least 30 min prior to plating cells.
4. Use a microscope to visually identify regions of differentiation
and sterilely remove them by scraping with a pipette tip.
5. Aspirate the media, add 1 ml of DPBS 1×, without Ca2+/Mg2+
and incubate for 7–10 min (clone-dependent) at room
temperature.
6. While cells are incubating, prepare the Matrigel plate. Aspirate
the Matrigel; label the new plate with the cell line name, the
new passage number and the date. Add 1 ml of mTeSR®1 with
ROCK inhibitor to each well.
7. Aspirate the DPBS 1× and add 1 ml of mTeSR®1 media with
ROCK inhibitor.
8. Scrape the cells using a cell lifter. Use a 5 ml serological pipette
to break the clumps by pipetting. Do not break the colonies
into single cells.
9. Add more mTeSR®1 media to achieve the desired split ratio for
the new plate. For example: 1:6 split of 1 well into 6 wells- scrape
with 1 ml total, add 5 ml more and plate 1 ml into each well.
10. Add 1 ml of the cell suspension into each well of the new
Matrigel plate.
11. Gently move in a front-to-back and side-to-side motion to uniformly disperse cells across the well, and return to 5 % CO2, 6 %
O2 incubator.
12. Beginning 24 h after passaging, replace media daily using
2 ml/well mTeSR®1 without ROCK inhibitor.

3.2 Direct Cardiac
Differentiation

Directed cardiac differentiation protocol consists of two stages: in
stage 1 (days 0–4.5), the hPSCs grown in feeder independent conditions are differentiated toward a multipotent cardiovascular progenitor population by the combinatorial activation of the BMP and
nodal/activin signaling pathways. In stage 2 (days 4.5–8), the
uncommitted progenitors are terminally differentiated toward
ventricular-like cardiomyocytes by the inhibition of the WNT signaling pathway with the small molecule IWR-1 [26] (Fig. 1).

(See Note 6)

1. Aspirate mTeSR®1 media.
2. Add 2 ml of DPBS 1×, without Ca2+/Mg2+ to each well and
incubate for 7–10 min at room temperature.
3. Aspirate DPBS 1×, without Ca2+/Mg2+ and add 1 ml of D0
media.
4. Scrape the cells very gently using a cell lifter; use a 5 ml serological pipette to break the clumps by gently pipetting. Do not
break the colonies into single cells.
5. Distribute the cells into a low cluster plate (1:1 split) and add
1 ml more of D0 media.
6. Incubate for 24 h in 6 % O2/5 % CO2/37 °C.

3.2.2 Day-1 Mesoderm
Induction

1. Prepare StemPro®-34 complete media: thaw StemPro®-34
Nutrient Supplement (see Note 5). Aseptically add the entire
contents (13 ml) of StemPro®-34 Nutrient Supplement directly
to a 500 ml bottle of StemPro®-34 Basal Media before use.
Add 2.5 ml Ascorbic acid and 1× GlutaMAX. Swirl to mix.
Filter using a 0.2 μm low-protein binding filter and use immediately or store at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.
2. Transfer EBs in suspension to a 15 ml tube; allow ~10–20 min
for settling by gravity at room temperature or 37 °C for longer
incubation.
3. Remove supernatant, resuspend the EBs in D1 media, and
transfer back into the original low cluster plate.

transfer back into the original low cluster plate.
3. Incubate for 24 h at 20 % O2/5 % CO2/37 °C.

3.2.4 Day-4.5 Cardiac
Induction

1. Prepare D4 media and add 1 ml/well (total volume: 3 ml/well).
2. Incubate at 20 % O2/5 % CO2/37 °C.

3.2.5 Day-5–7

1. Early spontaneous beating activity should be observed. If the
media turns yellow add 1 ml of StemPro®-34 complete media
in each well. Return the plate to the incubator.

3.2.6 Day-8

1. Replace the media with fresh StemPro®-34 complete media.
Continue to replace with StemPro®-34 complete media every
3–4 days for desired time of culture.

3.3 Gene Transfer
into Human
Pluripotent Stem Cells

1. Set the thermo-mixer at 37 °C before starting.

3.3.1 EBs Dissociation

3. Remove supernatant, add 750 μl of 0.025 % trypsin and place
the tube on a thermo-mixer; set the thermo-mixer at 1400 rpm,
37 °C, and incubate for 10 min.

2. Transfer EBs in suspension to a 1.5 ml tube; allow ~10–20 min
for settling by gravity (see Note 7).

4. Pipet up and down with a P1000 pipet until complete dissociation is obtained (see Note 8).
5. Add 750 μl of trypsin inhibitor (TNS) and centrifuge at 300 × g
for 5 min.
6. Aspirate the supernatant; resuspend the cells in 500 μl of
StemPro®-34 Complete media.
7. Count the cells.
8. Seed the cells into a 6-well plate freshly coated with Matrigel in
StemPro Complete media to allow attachment of dissociated
PSC-CMs (see Note 9).
9. Wait until the cells start beating again (1–2 days) before gene
transfer.

Notes
1. Slowly thaw hESC qualified matrix (5 ml) on ice at 4 °C overnight. Dispense aliquots into prechilled, 1.5 ml sterile microcentrifuge tubes and immediately store at −20 °C. The volume
of the aliquot will vary based on lot and typically ranges 270–
350 μl. Manufacturer provides details regarding volume of aliquot required to achieve a 1× concentration upon dilution into
24 ml of DMEM F-12.
2. Prepare Solutions using ultrapure water as a diluent unless otherwise indicated. Store each as aliquots at −20 °C: Rho kinase
(ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 (10 mM in DPBS, 100 μl aliquot);
l-ascorbic acid (10 mg/ml, 2.5 ml aliquot); Human
Recombinant BMP4 (10 μg/ml, 100 μl aliquot); Human
Recombinant Activin A (100 μg/ml, 50 μl aliquot); IWR1
(10 mM in DMSO, 10 μl aliquot); Blebbistatin (50 mM in
DMSO, 10 μl aliquot).
3. DetachKit 2 is a kit which contains Trypsin/EDTA Solution
(0.025 %/0.01 %) plus Trypsin Neutralizing Solution (TNS).
Make aliquots of 10 ml and store at −20 °C in the dark immediately after arrival. Thawed solutions can be stored at 4–8 °C
and used for up to 6 weeks.
4. This protocol is for passaging of cells as small aggregates of
approximately 50–200 μm in diameter. hPSCs are ready to passage when the majority of colonies are large, compact, and
have centers that are dense compared to their edges. The passaging time usually occurs on day 4 or 5 after plating.
5. Thaw supplements at room temperature (15–25 °C) or overnight at 4 °C. Do not thaw in a 37 °C water bath.
6. Start cardiac differentiation when hPSCs are 80–90 % confluent. hPSCs spontaneously form clusters which have compact
appearances after 24 h in suspension culture, suggesting the
development of a normal organized and complex EB structure. The formed EBs are highly uniform with high viability
(Fig. 2).
7. Transfer EBs from one well to one 1.5 ml tube (1:1 split).
Transfer 1.5 ml of EBs in suspension into 1.5 ml tube. Allow
~10 min for settling by gravity. Aspirate the supernatant and
repeat this step until all EBs from one well are transferred.
8. Transfer one drop of cells on the top of a cover-slip and check
at the microscope that single or very small groups of cells are
obtained after EBs dissociation.
9. Use a split ratio 1:1- Dissociate EBs from 1 well, count the
cells and plate to 1 well of a tissue culture 6-well plate freshly
coated with Matrigel. About 106 cells are usually obtained
using this protocol.

Gene Transfer to Rodent Hearts In Vivo
Federica del Monte, Kiyotake Ishikawa, and Roger J. Hajjar
Abstract
Altering expression of specific genes in rodent models allows the dissection of various pathways involved
in various disease states. Advances in gene transfer technologies produced vectors with tissue specificity,
various time courses, increasing or knocking down genes in an externally controlled fashion. To achieve
this goal, appropriate vector delivery method is essential for successfully conducting experiments. In this
chapter, we focus on cardiac gene transfer in rodents that can be employed for delivering both viral and
nonviral vectors.

Introduction

1.1 General
Introduction

Gene transfer technologies have advanced tremendously over the
last 10 years [1]. Even though the ultimate goal of gene transfer is
to correct monogenic diseases or increase/decrease expression of
genes clinically, in rodent models, however, altering expression of
specific genes is very useful [2]. It allows the dissection of various
pathways involved in various disease states. To allow for optimal
pathway’s targeting for therapy or for advancing the knowledge of
diseases, molecular mechanisms, it is critical to carefully mind the
design and delivery of vectors. Vector development allows for
in vivo gene expression with tissue specificity, various time courses,
increasing or knocking down genes in an externally controlled
fashion [3]. In addition to the design of the vectors, their delivery
method is important to achieve tissue expression without off site
vector sequestration and viral inactivation as well as modifying the
desired molecular aspect and not otherwise artificially manipulating the disease state (e.g., induction of ischemia or traumatic injury
to the organ). These improvements in the vectors and their delivery are quite important in manipulating disease states. In this chapter we focus on cardiac gene transfer in rats. These methods can be,

however, applied to mice models with slight modifications,
although some procedures may be technically more demanding
due to the size differences.
1.2 Cardiac Gene
Transfer

Delivering genes through vectors to the myocardium has been
attempted for over 20 years [4]. Initial attempts focused on
using dsDNA injected directly into the ventricles but this initial
approach had limited success. This was followed by the use of
viral vectors to deliver the gene product. These provided higher
efficiency of gene expression and allowed for easier delivery
modalities as well as tissue specificity and persistence of expression when injected directly [5], throughout the coronary circulation by transiently blocking the cardiac outflow using
cross-clamping techniques [6], or throughout the systemic circulation. However, the significant inflammation limited the usefulness of recombinant adenoviruses. The advent of recombinant
adeno-associated vectors (AAV) and especially cardiotropic AAV
serotypes (AAV9 and AAV10) has simplified gene transfer to the
myocardium and intravenous injections of AAV9 results in significant myocardial uptake that is persistent [7]. Modified RNA
used as a gene therapy vector has been very potent in inducing
gene expression for a short period of time [8]. We discuss the
various techniques of gene transfer regardless of the types of vector (viral or nonviral) used.

1.3

Genetic manipulation of specific genes in rodent models allowed
a better understanding of pathways involved in various disease
states. Short- and long-term gene expression can be achieved
using various vectors to manipulate disease pathways acutely or
testing the sustained effect of genetic loss or gain of function. For
short-term expression, modified RNA has become the vector of
choice, but it requires more invasive procedures. The development of cardiotropic AAV vectors instead has allowed noninvasive, simple injection of these vectors in the tail vein to obtain
long-term gene expression or suppression. Selection of vectors is
available not only for different time of expression but also to target specific tissues or cell types. AAV isotypes allows to target
specific organs whereas the use of cell specific promoters in adeno
or AAV vectors target all cells but express only in individual cell
types. Cell types targeting can be achieved also with the use of
different vectors. Lentiviral gene transfer for example can also be
used in cases where fibroblasts need to be transduced for differentiation purposes (direct reprogramming and iPS cells). As vectors become more sophisticated at targeting specific cell types the
delivery methods should become easier in animal models and
ultimately in human.

Materials
1. Gene Therapy Product: The gene therapy product can be a viral
or nonviral product. For cardiovascular application the most
common viral-based vectors include: recombinant adenoviruses [9, 10], AAV [11], and lentiviruses [12] while the most

and modified RNA [14]. Materials and methods for both viral
and nonviral preparations are discussed elsewhere in this series
(see Note 1).
2. Solution/nanoparticles used with vectors: Depending on the vectors used, different solutions are used during targeted cardiac
delivery.

Methods
The feasibility of in vivo cardiac gene transfer by viral vectors has
been consistently demonstrated both in large and smaller animals. A
number of mechanical approaches have been used to achieve cardiac
gene transfer as shown in Table 1. These methods have been refined
for rodent hearts and specifically for rat models. Below we cover the
methodologies for the different delivery approaches in the rat.

3.1 Preparation
of the Rat

1. Rats of different types of colonies (Fisher 344, Sprague Dawley,
Brown-Norway, or Wistar) are obtained. Experimental groups
should be appropriately designed and randomized [15]. The
rats should be free of antibody titers to a number of routinely
tested rat viruses. In addition, the rats should be free of all
endoparasites and ectoparasites and mycoplasma species.
2. The rats are maintained in a barrier room at 72 ± 2 °F with a
relative humidity at 50 ± 10 %, and fed a commercial laboratory
diet and water ad libitum. Ventilation in the room should be
between 12 and 15 air changes per hour of 100 % pre-filtered
outside air. The light cycle period should be controlled at 12 h
of light and 12 h of dark with no twilight transition. The
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee will need to
approve the study.

3.2

Anesthesia

1. Rats are anesthetized with intraperitoneal pentobarbital (40–
60 mg/kg) or other appropriate drugs approved in the institutional protocols.
2. A rectal temperature probe is placed in the animal and a heating lamp is used to maintain body temperature while the animal lies dorsally.
3. The animals are intubated via the larynx by using a 16 or 18 G
soft catheter. A small light source is placed on the neck over the

larynx and the tongue is lifted. This allows the larynx to be
clearly visualized permitting the angiocath to be accurately
introduced.
4. The rats are ventilated with tidal volumes of 2 cm3 at 50 cycles/
min with an FiO2 of 0.21. The ventilation should be operated
in volume-cycled, positive-pressure mode. To produce tidal
volumes, a constant airflow is gated into the animal during
inspiration (see Note 3).
3.3 Viral/Nonviral
Vector Preparation

(a) For recombinant adenoviruses, the glycerol solution is diluted
at least 1:1 with normal saline.
(b) For lentivirus, AAV vectors, and dsDNA, PBS or normal saline
can be used, and these solutions can be directly injected into
the animals or appropriately diluted.
(c) For modified RNA, use cationic lipid based nanoparticles.
Prior to injection the epoxide-derived lipidoid reagent is made
by nanoprecipitation of lipidoid with modRNA at high concentration followed by dialysis against phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) for a minimum of 3 h at 4 °C.
1. Dilute the vector in appropriate solution to the desired concentration, and prepare in a syringe (see Note 1). For adenovirus and modified RNA, the syringe should be kept on
ice until just prior to injection.

3.4 Direct Injection
into the Ventricular
Wall

Direct injection of gene vector solution into the ventricular wall
using an epicardial approach has also been shown to induce significant expression of reporter constructs (Fig. 1). There are different
approaches for this intervention. In an open-chested, ventilated
animal, direct inspection of the heart is possible and injection
directly into the area of interest is possible.
1. Remove the hair on the chest and thoroughly disinfect the surgical area.
2. Gently cut the skin and open the chest by dissecting the
sternum.
3. Open the pericardium and expose the heart.
4. Using a 30 G needle, the anterior, lateral, and infero-posterior
walls can be readily penetrated (see Note 4). For each injection, it is important to introduce the needle only a few millimeters (since the walls are 1–3 mm in thickness). Angling the
needle at 30–60° in relation to the ventricular wall yields the
best results. Investigators have used volumes of 10–50 μl per
injection. In this case, it is important to choose the solution in
which the vector is placed judiciously (see Notes 5–7).
5. Close the chest and recover the animal.
6. Administer appropriate analgesic drugs and antibiotics.

3.5 Pericardial Gene
Transfer

This method yields mainly epicardial staining.
1. Remove the hair on the chest and thoroughly disinfect the surgical area.
2. A small incision is made below the xiphoid in a transverse fashion.
3. Identify the pericardial sac and obtain a good view.
4. Using a 30 G needle, deliver the vector (100 μl) inside the
pericardium (see Note 8).
5. Close the chest and recover the animal.
6. Administer appropriate analgesic drugs and antibiotics.

3.6 Cross-Clamping
of the Aorta
and Pulmonary Artery

This method achieves grossly homogeneous transduction of cardiac myocytes throughout the left and right ventricles of the heart.
More importantly, this technique can produce dramatic, transgenespecific physiological effects on ventricular function in vivo. The
success of this approach likely reflects in vivo optimization of the

Rodent Gene Transfer

parameters previously shown to be important for ex vivo gene
transfer which: (1) the use of crystalloid solution as opposed to
whole blood, (2) high coronary flow rate, (3) exposure time, (4)
virus concentration, and (5) temperature (see Note 9).
1. Remove the hair on the chest and thoroughly disinfect the surgical area.
2. Gently cut the skin and open the chest by dissecting the sternum (see Note 10).
3. Open the pericardium and expose the heart.
4. Place a 7-0 suture at the apex of the left ventricle.
5. Identify the aorta and pulmonary artery, and gently isolate
these vessels for clamping.
6. Advance a 22 or 24 G catheter (depending on the size of the
animal) containing 200 μl of vector solution from the apex of
the left ventricle to the aortic root (see Note 11).
7. Clamp the aorta and pulmonary arteries distal to the site of the
catheter and inject the solution as shown in Fig. 2. Aortic

clamping can be performed, but the expression with aortic
clamping alone is low. Clamping both the aorta and pulmonary arteries yields better results.
8. After 10–60 s, release the clamp on the aorta and pulmonary.
The clamp can be maintained for 10 up to 60 s while the heart
is pumping against a closed system (isovolumically). This
allows the solution that contains the vectors to circulate down
the coronary arteries and perfuse the heart without direct
manipulation of the coronaries (see Notes 12 and 13).
9. Close the chest and recover the animal.
10. Administer appropriate analgesic drugs and antibiotics.
3.7 Tail Vein
Injection

Injection of vectors in the tail vein usually ends up in the liver to a
large degree. Cardiotropic AAV vectors (AAV9 or AAV10), however, have high tropism to the heart.
1. Prepare the vector solution. The amount of vector injected is
usually about 100–200 μl. The concentration of the vector is
critical with 1011–1012 vg being capable of infecting 30–80 % of
cardiac cells in the rats 1 month post gene transfer using AAV.
2. Immobilize or lightly anesthetize the animal and insert a 28 or
30 G catheter in the posterior tail vein of the animal.
3. Inject the vector solution (see Note 14).

4

Notes
1. It is critically important to have the correct concentration for
each of these vectors.
2. The viral solutions should be in aliquots of 50–200 μl and
stored at −80 °C. During the preparation for gene delivery, the
vector solution should be placed at appropriate temperature.
3. The FLOW RATE multiplied by the INSPIRATORY TIME
gives the tidal volume. RESPIRATORY RATE is set independently. Typical settings for 150–250 g rats are: respiratory rate: 50
breaths/min, tidal volume of 2 cm3, and inspiratory time of 0.5 s.
4. The interventricular septum can also be targeted by identifying
the interventricular branch of the coronary artery and directing the needle parallel to that branch.
5. Solutions containing high concentrations can cause increased
edema in the area of injection.
6. Using the left anterior descending artery as a guide, investigators have injected directly around the vessel for optimal left
ventricular gene transfer. This has yielded excellent results in
terms of functional effects. Coupled with needle injury, this
method of injection induces focal expression within the myocardium. For global myocardial expression, this method has
obvious shortcomings, but for local expression such as the

Rodent Gene Transfer

203

biological pacemaker or various growth factors used for blood
vessel growth, this is an ideal approach.
7. Echo-guidance injection can be also employed to determine
the location.
8. Collagenase and hyaluronic acid have been added to loosen
the collagen fibers and allow further entry of the vectors and
greater transduction of the cardiomyocytes (up to 40 % when
using adenovirus). However, a great deal of inflammation is
present with this procedure raising the concern that pericarditis and its sequelae may limit the usefulness of this approach.
9. The high perfusion pressure presumably allows the opening of
capillaries and optimizes the myocardial area of vector exposure. By cross clamping both the pulmonary artery and the
aorta, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure does not
increase since blood return to the left ventricle is minimal. This
allows perfusion of the virus at relatively low downstream pressure and the endocardium can be efficiently infected.
10. An incision from the left third intercostal space can be also used.
11. It is important to either feel or visualize the catheter as it is
advanced from the ventricular apex all the way to the aortic root.
12. During the period of cross-clamping, the right and left ventricles become visibly pale as clear viral solution perfuses the
myocardium through the coronary arteries. During the procedure, heart rate decreases from ~300 bpm to ~50 bpm, but
recovers to baseline within 30 s of clamp release. Ventricular
pressure returns to baseline within 60 s.
13. Pretreatment of the animals with either adenosine or serotonin
by injecting a solution containing 1–10 μM into the inferior
vena cava can also be used. This induces increased permeability
of the capillaries, resulting in enhanced attachment of the
viruses to myocardial cells.
14. Although it is relatively more invasive, AAV injection through
the jugular vein by cut down achieves higher infection efficiency. This approach is also mainly used to achieve a global
gene expression in rat models of heart failure and in transgenic
mice models of cardiomyopathies.

Ultrasound-Targeted Microbubble Destruction
for Cardiac Gene Delivery
Shuyuan Chen and Paul A. Grayburn
Abstract
Ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) is a novel technique that is used to deliver a gene
or other bioactive substance to organs of living animals in a noninvasive manner. Plasmid DNA binding
with cationic liposome into nanoparticles are assembled into the shell of microbubbles, which are circulated by intravenous injection. Intermittent bursts of ultrasound with low frequency and high mechanical
index destroys the microbubbles and releases the nanoparticles into targeted organ to transfect local organ
cells. Cell-specific promoters can be used to further enhance cell specificity. Here we describe UTMD
applied to cardiac gene delivery.
Key words Gene, Gene delivery, Microbubble, Ultrasound, Ultrasound targeted microbubble

Introduction
A number of techniques have been proposed for gene delivery to
the heart, including intracoronary, intrapericardial, and direct
myocardial injection. We have previously demonstrated successful
transfection of rat myocardium in vivo by ultrasound-targeted
microbubble destruction (UTMD) of microbubbles containing an
adenovirus encoding reporter gene, plasmids, and/or proteins
[1–11]. Other groups also successfully applied this technique to
cardiac gene delivery [12–35].
The delivery of bioactive substances by ultrasound targeted
microbubble destruction is based upon assembling perfluorcarbonfilled microbubbles together with a bioactive substance, thus incorporating it into the shell of the bubbles (Fig. 1). During intravenous
infusion of these bubbles, they can be destroyed with high mechanical index ultrasound in the target organ as they distribute through
the vasculature, thus releasing the transported substance into
the surrounding tissue (Fig. 2). To show that DNA is indeed
incorporated into the shell, confocal microscopy was utilized.

Washed microbubbles were stained with propidium iodide (stains
DNA) and fluorescein (to stain the lipid shell) (Fig. 3).
It is important to measure microbubble size and concentration when trying new bubble protocols. This can be easily done in
a Beckman coulter counter (Multisizer3). Typical concentrations
are in 1–3 × 109 bubbles per ml. Mean size should be around 2.0–
2.3 μm (Fig. 4).

1. Prepare lipid stock solution. To dissolve ingredients, heat in
boiling water-bath (approximately 20–30 min) and pipette up
and down every 5 min until no particles are visible. Filtering
through gauze may be helpful. This stock solution can be
stored at 4 °C.
To make microbubbles:
2. Add 50 μl of glycerol in a 1.5 ml tube.
3. 1 ml of alcohol added to a tube contains 2 mg of plasmid
DNA, spin down and throwaway supernatant, incubating
DNA pellets to dry in 37 °C for 30–60 min.
4. Add 250 μl of lipid stock solution to the tube contains 2 mg of
dried DNA.
5. Merge 1 and 3. And keep them on ice.

Procedure

1. Choose rats between 200 and 300 g for experiments. Inject
2–3 ml of 4× Avertin i.p. After rat is anesthetized shave off the
hair on the chest and neck. Then add Nair™ on the chest and
let sit for 2–4 min. After removing the Nair, no hair should be
visible on the rat chest (Fig. 7).

Fig. 8 5 mm skin incision above the jugular vein mediolateral of the neck

Fig. 9 Use the curved clamp to bluntly enlarge the incision and then prepare the
jugular vein

2. An incision will be made (about 5 mm) mediolateral of the
neck where a pulsation is visible (Fig. 8). With the curved
clamp enlarge the incision. Then use the fine curved clamp to
bluntly prepare the jugular vein. When the vein is exposed
carefully tunnel it with the fine curved clamp. Then use the
clamp to pull a 6-0 silk suture underneath the vein. Be careful
not to twist the vein when pulling the suture through. Adding
a drop of water can help. Ligate the vein with a cranial suture
and prepare a caudal suture to bind over the catheter later
(Figs. 9 and 10).
3. To prepare the catheter cut about 30 cm of the polyethylene tubing. By using an oblique position of the scissors the tip of the

the catheter

Fig. 11 The left hand holds the vein by its cranial suture as well as the catheter.
With the right hand the incision is made

catheter becomes pointed. A 45° angle is favorable. Then insert
the Luer Stub Adapter 23 G (or alternatively 23 G needle) in one
end and flush the catheter with saline or PBS (see Note 1).
4. To insert the catheter hold the vein by the cranial suture and make
a careful superficial cut with the Vannas scissors. Alternatively, one
can use a fine injection needle (especially in mice). Have the catheter in hand while incising the vein (Fig. 11).
5. After the incision is made, let go of the scissors and take a blunt
forceps to grab the catheter and insert it into the vein (Fig. 12).
After insertion, proper catheter position can be verified by aspirating the syringe. Then the caudal suture can be tied tightly
around the catheter. Now, the catheter can be connected with
the infusion pump (Fig. 13) (see Note 2).

3.4 Ultrasonic
Microbubble
Destruction

1. After the catheter is inserted, three EKG electrodes will be
attached to three paws. Then a small amount of ultrasound gel
is distributed on the chest. This helps to avoid small air bubbles trapped under few hairs (see Note 3).
2. After localizing the heart (feeling the pulse with the finger), a
large amount of gel is added on the chest to produce a standoff
for the probe (see Note 4).
3. Then the S3 ultrasound probe will be clamped on the chest
leaving at least 1 cm of gel between the probe and the skin
(Figs. 14 and 15).
4. Ultrasound machine settings (for example, Sonos 5500) (see
Notes 5–12).

5. A mid-ventricular short axis view is to be acquired. This is
mostly possible after the contrast agent has been injected. A
good quality image is crucial for efficient transfer of bioactive
substance. If the image is good, myocardium and cavity are
clearly distinguishable. After high MI ultrasound the myocardial opacification should be significantly lower than before
destroying the microbubbles (Fig. 16).
6. Microbubbles suspension should be infused over a 5–10 min
period (Fig. 17). It is important to agitate the infusion pump regularly in order to maintain a homogeneous bubble suspension.
7. After finishing the experiment, the catheter is removed and the
skin is closed with a 4-0 silk suture. The animal should awake
within 30–60 min.
8. Potential complications (see Notes 13–15).

Notes
1. Be careful not to leave any air in the catheter, since low volumes
are sufficient to kill the rat by embolization.
2. When changing the PBS-syringe with the one containing the
microbubbles, it is important that no air is introduced into the
system.
3. A drop of ultrasound gel on each electrode helps to improve
EKG signal.
4. Be careful to avoid air bubbles. Optionally, the gel can be centrifuged before applying it.
5. Ultraharmonic mode (transmit 1.3 MHz).
6. Mechanical Index 1.4.
7. Triggered imaging—every fourth beat—four frames of
ultrasound.
8. Delay 80 ms.
9. All segmental gains to 0.
10. Gain 50.
11. Compress 75.
12. Postprocess B.
13. Arrhythmia: The high MI ultrasound may cause premature
ventricular beats. As long as these occur rarely they can be
tolerated. If however they occur with each high MI US and
come in doublets and triplets, the mechanical index should be
reduced, since the animal will be at risk for ventricular tachycardia or even ventricular fibrillation. Usually, reducing the
MI to 1.0 will reduce the arrhythmia and after a few minutes
the MI can be gradually increased again. If an animal develops
ventricular tachycardia, the probe should be immediately
removed. Pumping of the chest with a thumb may help revive
the animal.
14. Pulmonary embolism: Pulmonary embolism occurs if air was
injected by mistake or if microbubbles are too large (foamy
microbubbles). This event is normally characterized by missing
contrast in the left ventricle and a highly opacified large right
ventricle. Usually, the rat will stop breathing within a minute
and rarely survives.
15. Insufficient contrast effect of microbubbles: If microbubbles
do not develop a sufficient contrast effect after injection or if
contrast effect is too short, then the tube most likely had too
much air when bubbles were made (either empty gas cylinder
or leaking tubes). Always use high quality tubes that will close
tightly and make sure enough gas is available.

A Needleless Liquid Jet Injection Delivery Approach
for Cardiac Gene Therapy
Anthony S. Fargnoli, Michael G. Katz, and Charles R. Bridges
Abstract
Fundamentally, cardiac gene therapy clinical trials have demonstrated that route efficiency is paramount in
achieving maximum myocardial expression within safety limits. Gene transfer phenomena are largely influenced by physical transport principles (i.e., pressure, residence time, dispersion trafficking, mechanical resistance) that are independent of therapeutic characteristics. An alternative to intracoronary infusion methods,
in an effort to improve efficiency in terms of cardiac specificity, is direct myocardial delivery via surgical
injection. Direct injection methods circumvent the blood’s immunological components and the cardiac
system’s native anatomical barriers by directly administering product into the myocardium. In addition, this
approach offers the advantage of precise site selection. Two unresolved problems with direct delivery
wherein the novel needleless liquid jet approach may resolve are: (1) initial therapeutic retention and (2)
subsequent host responses associated with highly focal expression.
In this protocol, we present a novel approach to improve direct cardiac gene delivery using a needleless
liquid jet methodology. The liquid jet application is essentially a device concept that accelerates and disperses
the therapeutic at a targeted myocardial site. The core hypothesis offered is that this approach, with
optimized settings, could result in increased therapeutic retention in the initial delivery phase. This would
theoretically result in more total myocardial expression per dose while at the same time providing a more
homogenous profile around the injection site. Therefore, this would increase efficiency in terms of transduced muscle per delivery site and offer a significant improvement to standard intramuscular injection.

Introduction
The majority of cardiac gene therapy clinical trials have reported
largely negative results in terms of efficacy. It is believed that the
disparity between the preclinical and clinical results is directly attributable to the very low to undetectable levels of therapeutic expression in human myocytes. Therefore, achieving sufficient gene
transfer in cardiovascular diseases with a reliable and safe delivery
method has been a major impediment that must be addressed.
Certainly for cardiac gene therapy, the predominant mechanism is
therapeutic myocyte gene expression which can only result from

vector transduction. Unfortunately, the inability to transfer the
genome copies into a substantial percentage of cells diminishes any
chance of achieving documented therapeutic efficacy.
Needleless liquid jet injection is characterized as a ballistic
delivery based approach. The technology was originally developed
in the early 1960s and applied for these simple medical applications: mass routine vaccinations, administration of local anesthetics, tuberculin testing, and dermatology treatments of minor skin
lesions. Another similar and more widely known in vitro application of particle bombardment is the “gene gun” approach. This
method was originally reported in the same period which utilizes
heavy metal particles associated with DNA to be introduced with a
high velocity pressurized inert gas into the target cell. Naked DNA
is complexed with these particles prior to loading, and after injection they enter the cell and gradually released. Acceleration can be
achieved by a high-voltage electric spark or a helium pressure gun.
For optimal gene expression the following parameters have been
taken into account: (a) the properties, density and sizes of gold
particles for bombardment; (b) the DNA doses, and (c) the discharge voltage for optimal gold particles penetration. Using a submicrogram amount of DNA per bombardment, 1000–10,000
copies of DNA can be delivered to each target cell [1, 2]. The
fundamental principal of the gene gun is based on the bombardment of micrometer-sized heavy metal particles coated with therapeutic DNA. The transfer to the target cells is achieved by means
of direct penetration through the many holes in the plasma membrane. However, a problem with penetration throughout the
thickness of the myocardium was noted, as only the surface layer of
cardiomyocytes was transfected [3]. Uncoated metal particles
could also be delivered through a solution containing DNA
surrounding the cell thus picking up the genetic material and proceeding into the living cell. Despite some interest for clinical applications these problems have prevented use: technical maintenance
cost, complexity of parameters and complexity issues with combining vectors to relatively large metallic particles. Given the stability
and formulation advantages of modern viral vectors, ballistic delivery of active therapeutic is more cost effective through liquid jet
delivery.
1.1 Liquid Jet
Delivery Principles

The ballistic method of jet injection is performed using a high-speed
pressurized gas, typically air or carbon dioxide however the driving
gas can be designated per application. The injection consists of
piercing center jet stream and surrounding micro jets. The resultant impact force of the jet expands the distance between the cell
pores, increases pores, and generates new pores in the cellular and
endothelial membranes, and promotes a better distribution of
the proteins and genes in the interstitial compartment (Fig. 1).
The penetration power depends on three factors: (1) the applied

Needleless Liquid Jet Delivery for Gene Therapy

Fig. 1 Liquid jet delivery of plasmid DNA. Liquid jet delivery is demonstrated featuring DNA vector suspended
in a liquid formulation being accelerated and dispersed at the target myocytes

pressure of the gas, (2) the dispersion factor of the jet as a function
of the nozzle bore, and (3) the target tissue’s mechanical and host
response properties [4]. Levels of gene expression by jet injection
were found to be 50-fold higher than by conventional needle injection in one preliminary study [5]. The jet injection gene transfer is
usually well tolerated without side effects provided that the driving
pressure settings are optimized.
These previous applications are only described for nonviral
based techniques of gene transfer using relatively high pressure.
Macromolecules of varying chemistries and properties can be delivered such as stable active compounds, DNA and to a lesser degree
proteins. Pressure used is typically less than 3–4 bars with resultant
velocity profile of the droplets ranging from 100 to 300 m/s. The
velocity of the fluid in the jet injection contributes to the transmural distribution in the tissues, whereas the diameter of the jet and
the injected volume limit the penetration depth [6]. The efficiency
of this method depends on nozzle diameter (150–300 μm), velocity of the liquid jet and distance between the nozzle and surface of
the tissue [7, 8]. The penetration of the injected molecules inside the
cells subsequently results in direct uptake, maximizes bioavailability

in the tissue microenvironment for additional molecules, and in
worst case inadvertently reaches off target organs via local systemic
circulatory penetration. In another study, the intramuscular jet
injection of DNA combined with electroporation was demonstrated to be feasible in a mouse model [9]. We and others could
not find publications on the applications of this method for cardiac
gene therapy, thus indicating its novelty for viral vector based
therapy [10–12].

The stainless steel needleless liquid jet (DERMOJet™) was purchased from Robbins Instruments (Chatham, NJ). The device
itself was invented by Dr. A. Krantz in France with the medical
device manufacturer Akra DermoJet (Pau, France). The device
consists of a stainless steel design with polycarbonate reservoir with
dimensions: 8 oz (weight), 6.5 in. (length), and 11/16th in.
(Diameter) injector head. The exit orifice is 0.0079″ (32 gauge;
235 μm) diameter in a jewel shape design. The size transmission
limit is crystalline particles up to 200 μm. The device is actuated by
a very high constant spring mechanism which drives a piston that
subsequently accelerates a fixed volume fluid load. Injection is executed by a loading lever mechanism which sets the spring lock element, while the push button trigger releases for the acceleration of
drug through the orifice. The ejection orifice features an internal
jewel shaped configuration for a dispersive effect. The ejection volume is fixed at 100 μl, which is a typical ideal retention limit for
most tissues. Various mechanical components in the device are
tunable, most notably the spring and orifice characteristics.

All animal studies must follow National Institute of Health

Methods

3.1 Preoperative
Care and Preparation

1. At least 30 min prior to surgery rats will receive analgesic as
well as antibiotic and nonspecific anti-inflammatory as listed
above preoperative analgesia. Shave the surgical site.
2. Rats will be anesthetized using induction and maintenance
anesthesia, then intubated (ventilator setting: ventilation
~120–150 ml/min; a tidal volume of 2–2.5 ml and respiratory
rate of 50–70) and transferred to a warming pad.
3. An eye lubricant is applied to prevent the animal’s eyes from
drying. The next step is to connect the rat to an EKG machine
and a SpO2 monitor.
4. Animal is monitored for any movement or tail pinch response
to assure proper depth of anesthesia. Secure endotracheal tube
in position. Connect the rat’s endotracheal tube to the ventilator with the rat in left lateral decubitus position.
5. On day of injection, prepare sufficient sterile diluted vector to
allow for a 350-μl injection per pup as well as an additional
150 μl to account for losses during preparation and injection.
Keep diluted vector on ice until injection.

3.2 A Needless
Liquid Jet Injection
Vector Delivery

1. Scrub the rat’s chest two times with chlorhexidine solution,
and drape the rat in a sterile fashion.
2. Make a 2-cm skin incision at the left chest, divide the subcutaneous tissue and underlying thoracic muscles, and enter the
thorax through the fourth intercostal space. Once the chest is
entered the lung is reflected posteriorly and the pericardium is
incised without disrupting the phrenic nerve to expose the left
ventricle.

stain (i.e., GFP purple) revealed transmural expression profiles presented in the middle and basal LV sections.
The composite left ventricular coverage scoring as a percentage of 2D transmural area was in the range of 50
to as high as 70 % for the majority of sections

3. Load liquid jet injector with a vector (see Note 1). The key
parameter is the injector head distance normal to the target cardiac plane. To execute, the pen configuration injector is mounted
to a stainless steel arm apparatus secured to a solid base (Fig. 2)
(see Note 2). The optimal distance range is determined between
8 and 10 in. (i.e., nozzle tip to heart surface) (see Note 3).
Sufficient delivery volume is loaded into the chamber to ensure
consistent kinetics as per DermoJet™ manufacturer instructions
(see Note 4). Three separate shots, each containing 100 μl, are
fired perpendicular to the LV surface. Hits are confirmed by
detection of pinhole piercing on the epicardial surface with
surrounding coloration changes. Left ventricular cross section
GFP distribution is presented in Fig. 3.
4. Once needless injections are complete, place an 18-G angiocath through the skin into the thorax via the fifth or sixth inter-

costal space. This will serve as a chest tube to restore negative
intrathoracic pressure. Give a manual sigh breath from the
ventilator to reinflate the lungs completely.
5. Once hemostasis is achieved, closure of the ribs is performed
with a 4-0 Prolene suture followed by closure of the chest
muscles using a 5-0 Vicryl suture. After tying these sutures, a
3 ml syringe is used to evacuate the air/fluid in the thoracic
cavity in order to regain the normal negative pressure. The skin
incision is closed using a running 5-0 Vicryl absorbable suture.
After this suture is finished, chest tube removed, isoflurane
flow is halted and the animal is weaned off the ventilator and
oxygen.
6. If multiple procedures are being performed the same day, the
rat can be moved to the optional recovery ventilator until
spontaneous respirations are observed.
7. Standard rodent pain treatment courses with this particular
model are typically between 24 and 72 h post-operative time.
Animals are provided a local anesthetic to the wound area prior
to emergence from anesthesia as well as fluids for support and
kept on a warming pad with supplemental oxygen for 24 h.
Animals also receive analgesic and antibiotics as directed above
(Post-surgical medication).
8. The animals will be observed for signs of pain, anxiety, and or
respiratory distress. Criteria for this level of distress will be
poor general appearance of coat, lethargy, eye color, breathing
rate >130 beats/min or labored breathing.

Notes
1. A liquid jet device is acquired and modified for cardiac delivery
applications. The spring actuator length is reduced by
80–1.9 cm, which resulted in a significant driving power reduction. A super speed camera (Zeiss International, Thornwood
NY) at the University of Pennsylvania Complex Fluids
Laboratory is used in a custom analysis suite to quantify jet
fluid exit velocity and to compute estimated driving pressure.
The nozzle jet velocity is measured at 110 m/s based on a
30,000 images per second capture rate. The driving pressure
ranged from 150 to 250 kilopascals (kPa). Prior to the modification, the factory setting results were 330 m/s velocity at
greater than 550 kPa.
2. The next key parameter to optimize for a surgical application is
the injector head distance normal to the target cardiac plane.
To execute, the pen configuration injector is mounted to a
stainless steel arm apparatus secured to a solid base. For alignment

226

Anthony S. Fargnoli et al.

with the cardiac targeted surface plane, an optical system
consisting of a field laser and digital level are utilized in conjunction to ensure accuracy between injections.
3. The safe liquid jet delivery distance range is determined by
performing a limited number of acute studies with methylene
blue dye injection. Safety criteria are defined as tolerance of six
consecutive 100 μl needleless injections without visible bleeding and ECG changes. Confirmation of hits is validated via
marks by surface retention of dye. The optimal distance range
is determined between 8 and 10 in. (i.e., nozzle tip to heart
surface). This range is found effective where sufficient dye is
retained transmurally, but no incidence of major cardiac damage
was observed.
4. The experiments indicated that the DermoJet™ device as is
would not be suitable for any cardiac application since the
potent jet is piercing with high force and simultaneously providing limited distribution. Advancing to distances greater than
24 in. from the target organ are required to remotely obtain
anything of value in terms of dye transfer, thus it is imperative
to modify the settings. Since the device is actuated by a spring,
we worked with the manufacturer to cut the constant down by
80 % of the original length. The original jet velocity is measured
and confirmed by the factory at just over 330 m/s out of the
100–200 kPa driving pressure range.

Techniques

and Kiyotake Ishikawa
Abstract
Percutaneous antegrade coronary injection is among the least invasive cardiac selective gene delivery methods. However, transduction efficiency is quite low with a simple bolus antegrade injection. In order to
improve the transduction efficiency using antegrade delivery, several additional approaches have been
proposed.
In this chapter, we briefly discuss important elements associated with intracoronary delivery methods
and present protocols for three different catheter-based antegrade delivery techniques in a preclinical large
animal model. Despite the lower transduction efficacy relative to more invasive delivery techniques, antegrade techniques have the advantage of being clinically well established and having safer profiles which is
important when treating patients with cardiac disease.

Introduction
Percutaneous antegrade coronary injection is among the least
invasive cardiac selective delivery methods with relatively safe and
simple profiles. However, transduction efficiency has been
reported to be compromised with a simple bolus of antegrade
injection [1]. To increase the transduction efficiency, additional
approaches (slow intracoronary perfusion, intracoronary perfusion + coronary artery occlusion, intracoronary perfusion + coronary artery occlusion + coronary sinus occlusion) have been
proposed and tested in preclinical animal models [2]. In this
chapter, we briefly describe features of each method and present
practical protocols to perform preclinical gene transfer experiments in large animals.
In ex vivo gene transfer experiments using adenovirus, it has
been shown that higher coronary flow, vector dwelling time,

vector dose, and use of permeability enhancing agents are the most
important factors that lead to increased transduction efficiency [3].
The importance of these factors was validated in vivo with perfusion pressure as an additional factor [1, 4, 5]. Figure 1 shows the
important factors for increasing gene transduction efficiency
through vascular administration of vectors.
1.1 Slow
Intracoronary
Perfusion

This method is the simplest procedure in terms of antegrade
approaches, and the vectors are administered slowly into the coronary arteries without interruption of the coronary flow [6–11].
This procedure is similar to coronary angiograms that are performed routinely in patients and the method is well established. It
is especially attractive for patients with end-stage heart failure, as
the procedure takes less time and is relatively less invasive compared to other cardiac targeting delivery methods. However, it suffers from lower transduction efficiency. Visual guidance of this
procedure is available elsewhere [12].

1.2 Intracoronary
Perfusion + Coronary
Artery Occlusion

This method delivers vectors through the lumen of an inflated balloon catheter with a temporary occlusion of the coronary artery.
Temporarily blocking the coronary artery flow with a balloon catheter and injecting the vectors distal to the balloon results in higher
delivered vector concentrations as well as longer dwell time [4, 13].
Depending on the injection rate, higher coronary flow and perfusion
pressure can also be achieved. However, the efficacy of coronary
arterial blockade remains controversial. Boekstegers et al. showed
ischemia during coronary artery infusion did not significantly

Intracoronary Injection

increase myocardial transduction [14]. In contrast, Shah et al.
reported infusion with temporary coronary occlusion with a considerably higher flow rate and consequently elevated coronary pressures resulted in higher gene expression, but this was also associated
with more myocardial injury [15]. A brief coronary occlusion may
induce favorable effects on gene uptake due to myocardial ischemic
conditioning, however it comes with the risk of ischemia induced
myocardial stunning as well as coronary vessel injuries.
1.3 Intracoronary
Perfusion + Coronary
Artery
Occlusion + Coronary
Sinus Occlusion

2

Since the cardiac circulation is predominately supplied by the coronary arteries and drained through the coronary sinus, both of these
vessels can be the target of gene transfer. A combination of coronary artery and coronary sinus blockade increases the pressure in
the closed circuit between the balloons inflated in the coronary
artery and the coronary sinus [1, 13]. It can also increase the vector dwelling time and this method results in elevated transgene
expression. As with intracoronary perfusion with coronary arterial
balloon occlusion, high coronary pressure can cause myocardial
injury. Since the outflow of coronary flow is also blocked in this
method, the injury can be more severe.

Methods

3.1 Slow
Intracoronary
Perfusion

1. The animal (a pig or other large animal) is premedicated using
Telazol (tiletamine/zolazepam) (8.0 mg/kg) and buprenorphine (0.6 mg) (see Note 4).

maintained with Propofol (8–10 mg/kg/h) throughout the
procedure (see Note 4).
3. The animal is placed in dorsal position on a heating mat during
the procedure, with its legs held tight by ropes. Connect the
monitors on the animal. The puncture site is prepared with 70 %
isopropyl alcohol followed by povidone–iodine. A percutaneous
puncture provides access to the artery for sheath placement
(see Note 5).
4. Puncture the peripheral artery (femoral or carotid artery) to
obtain an arterial using the Seldinger method (see Note 6).
5. Administer heparin sodium at the dose of 200–300 U/kg IV
to achieve an activated coagulation time of 250–300 s.

pressure monitor line (also to the manifold for angiography). (c) Y-connector with
hemostatic valve and coronary wires. (d) Guiding catheter

7. Intravenous nitroglycerin (1 μg/Kg/min) infusion is started
through the ear vein.
8. Set up the injection lines as presented in Fig. 2.
9. Engage the left coronary artery (LCA) and after the angiogram,
advance two 0.014-in. guide wires, one into the left anterior
descending artery (LAD) and one into the left circumflex
coronary artery (LCX) to increase the stability of the catheter
position (see Note 7).
10. Prepare two syringes. In the first syringe, dilute the vector
solution to 20 ml with saline or PBS. Prepare another syringe
filled with saline or PBS 10 ml (flush). This will be used to
deliver the residual virus within the catheter lumen.
11. Confirm that the catheter tip is stable at just proximal to the
bifurcation of LAD and LCX. The pressure through the catheter
is monitored to ensure that the catheter is not wedging.
12. The vector solution (15 ml) is injected through the catheter
over 15 min (1 ml/min) using an infusion pump into the LCA.
After 15 min, the syringe is exchanged to the flush, and infusion
is continued for 5 min (1 ml/min) (see Note 8 and Fig. 2).
13. Remove the catheter from the LCA. Engage the catheter to
the right coronary artery (RCA) (see Note 9).
14. A 0.014 in. wire and a catheter are fixed to the RCA the same
way as the LCA.

15. The remaining 5 ml of saline or PBS mixed with virus is injected
into the RCA for 5 min (1 ml/min) followed by 5 min
(1 ml/min) of flush.
16. Withdraw the guiding catheter and the wire.
17. Withdraw the sheath from the artery and achieve hemostasis
by applying direct pressure to the site for several minutes (see
Note 10).
3.2 Intracoronary
Perfusion + Coronary
Artery Occlusion

1. The methods for the coronary artery access are same as
Subheading 3.1.
2. Prepare a manual external defibrillator for ventricular fibrillation that can be induced by the coronary artery occlusion (see
Notes 11).
3. For the coronary artery occlusion, advance an angioplasty balloon along with the coronary guide wire into the target artery.
4. Perform an angiogram and place the balloon in a proximal part
of the coronary artery. Inflate the coronary balloon (total
3 min) and remove the wire inside the OTW balloon. Inject
the vector solution slowly through the wire lumen of the
angioplasty balloon (see Notes 12–14).
5. Deflate the balloon and wait for 5–10 min to allow the heart to
recover from short ischemia.
6. Repeat the injection as needed depending on the volume of
the vector solution. Upon finishing the injection, remove the
balloon and the wire from the target coronary artery.
7. Advance a balloon along with the coronary wire into another
target artery. Similarly occlude and inject the vectors.
8. Withdraw the guiding catheter, the balloon, and the wire.
9. Withdraw the sheath from the artery and achieve hemostasis
by applying direct pressure to the site for several minutes
(see Note 10).

3.3 Intracoronary
Perfusion + Coronary
Artery
Occlusion + Coronary
Sinus Occlusion

1. The method for the coronary artery access is same as
Subheading 3.1. The method for the coronary artery ballooning is same as Subheading 3.2.
2. Advance the guide wire with the guiding catheter to venous
system (see Note 15).
3. Select the great cardiac vein with a 0.025 (0.014–0.035) inch
wire and advance an occlusion balloon to the great cardiac vein
(see Note 16).
4. Occlude the artery and the vein simultaneously. Remove the
coronary wire in the occluded arterial balloon and administer
vectors slowly through the lumen. Wait for 3 min after occlusion of the coronary artery and sinus (see Notes 12–14) [3, 8].

5. Withdraw the guiding catheters, the balloons, and the wires.
6. Withdraw the sheaths from the artery and the vein and achieve
hemostasis by applying direct pressure to the site for several
minutes (see Note 10).

Notes
1. A Hockey Stick catheter is suitable for the femoral approach
and an Amplatz Right catheter is suitable for the carotid
approach in pigs. Usually a 5Fr Hockey Stick catheter can
cannulate both the LCA and RCA.
2. The shorter balloon is preferred to minimize the damage of
the endothelium from the expansion of the balloon. Usually
1–2 atm is sufficient to completely occlude the coronary artery
using an appropriate size of the balloon.
3. An Amplatz Left catheter is suitable for the femoral approach
to engage the coronary sinus and Judkins Right is suitable for
the jugular vein approach in pigs.
4. Analgesia, anesthesia, and antibacterial drugs are approved by
the animal committee at the facility for all procedures.
Inhalational anesthetics can be used instead of propofol.
5. Pulling the leg of the puncture side will facilitate the vessel
puncture. In young healthy animals, vessels can flexibly move
and avoid needles when the legs are loosely pulled.
6. The femoral and the carotid arteries can also be accessed by a
cut down method. Echo guidance will increase the accuracy of
the puncture.
7. The administration of a vector solution into the coronary artery
seems simple, but it can be tricky especially in some species. An
appropriate injection catheter should be chosen for each species.
This can vary depending on the size of the animals. Inserting the
coronary wires into the branches will assure the catheter stability
at the coronary ostium. The catheter tip should remain inside
the left main tract; however, deep engagement of the catheter
into the branches can cause an obstruction of the coronary
artery and the formation of a thrombus. A large amount of heparin administration, the continuous monitoring of the catheter
position under fluoroscopy, and checking the blood pressure
and ECG for signs of ischemic changes are important.
8. Make sure the Y connector valve is tightly locked. A leak from
loosely closed Y connecter results in loss of vectors.
9. An appropriate catheter for the RCA should be determined
before the starting of LCA vector delivery. Catheters that fit
both the LCA and RCA are preferred; however, stable RCA
cannulation and easy manipulation should be prioritized.

234

10. Protamine sulfate can be administered slowly over 5 min to accelerate hemostasis if the vector does not interact with the drug.
Although the frequency is low, protamine sulfate can cause hypotension. Continuous monitoring with ECG and pulse oximeter is
necessary. If the signal of the pulse oximeter is lost, check the
noninvasive blood pressure. If there is hypotension, inject 1–2 ml
of atropine sulfate IV or, in a severe case, inject low dose of epinephrine or phenylephrine IV. With timely administration of
these drugs, the pig will recover without any adverse effects.
11. In case of ventricular fibrillation, apply 200 J shock as soon as
possible. If the rhythm does not recover, deflate the balloon
and apply another shock. Chest compression should be maintained during the arrhythmia. Check the pressure monitor to
evaluate the hemodynamics.
12. Continuously monitor the blood pressure and deflate the balloon if the pressure becomes too low. Preconditioning the
heart by applying 10–15 s of occlusions may enable a more
stable hemodynamics during 3 min injection.
13. Intracoronary adenosine (25 μg) can be injected to increase cellular permeability before injection of the vector solution [16].
14. It has been shown that higher injection rate is associated with
myocardial injury [4].
15. The coronary sinus ostium is located between the atrial septum
and the right ventricle. An injection of contrast from the
coronary artery can facilitate identifying the location of the
coronary sinus.
16. To prevent the perforation of the coronary vein, forming a
loop with the tip of the wire is recommended.

Direct Myocardial Injection of Vectors

Abstract
Gene therapy holds great promise as a targeted treatment of cardiovascular diseases, which remain a major
cause of morbidity and mortality in contemporary societies. Selection of the appropriate vector delivery
method is critical for efficient transduction in the myocardium. Direct myocardial delivery is a feasible and
effective method that has been shown to exhibit enhanced gene expression compared to coronary infusion
and pericardial delivery. It is one of the most widely used gene transfer methods in both animal studies and
clinical trials. The advantages, which result from a delivery that avoids exposure to the blood and bypasses the
endothelial barrier, are a high local concentration at the injection site and a decreased leakage to off-target
organs. The vectors are injected either with an endomyocardial or an epicardial approach, either surgically or
percutaneously. In this chapter, we present the different approaches of direct myocardial injection, their
advantages and their realization method in preclinical large animal models of cardiovascular diseases.

Introduction
Selection of the appropriate vector delivery method is critical for
efficient transgene expression in the myocardium [1, 2]. Although
attractive, given its well-established technique, the coronary artery
infusion method faces obstacles that limit an effective gene transduction in the myocardium: circulating DNases, neutralizing antibodies, cell-mediated immunity and endothelial barrier. Moreover,
as a simple intra-coronary injection achieved a very low transduction with in vivo models in several studies, an occlusion of the
coronary artery in order to extend the viral adhesion time has been
suggested, which can cause acute ischemia. Even for a short duration, this may not be tolerated by patients with advanced heart
failure or multi-vessel coronary artery disease. Finally, in a clinical
setting, this administration route may be inaccessible in the cases of
severe atherosclerosis or chronic total occlusions. The coronary
venous system constitutes an alternate route whereby access to the

myocardium can be achieved regardless of atherosclerosis severity
or coronary obstruction. However, as balloon blockade of the
coronary artery and sinus is necessary to prevent rapid vector
washout to the periphery, it has the same risk related to acute ischemia for patients.
All these hurdles can be circumvented if the vector is injected
directly into the targeted myocardium. Direct myocardial injection
thus provides an attractive alternative insofar as it bypasses the
blood and anatomical barriers, resulting in a more efficient and
cardiospecific delivery. It results in localized high transgene expression compared to other methods [3, 4] and is therefore one of the
most widely used gene transfer and stem cell therapy methods in
clinical trials focused on myocardial repair.
Direct injection of the vectors into the myocardium can be
achieved either surgically or percutaneously.
In clinical trials, surgical gene transfer is widely applied to
patients whose myocardium is easily accessible such as during cardiothoracic surgeries. It can also be done during a dedicated procedure without cardiac arrest via lateral minithoracotomy [5].
Surgical delivery offers direct visual confirmation, which allows
precise control of the injection. Limited exposure of the vectors to
the blood reduces vector degradation. Together with bypassing of
transendothelial crossing and local delivery, this method provides a
high concentration at the injection site. It also enables gene transfer to the avascular and inaccessible areas. Moreover, training
requirements are not too demanding [6] and animal as well as
clinical studies have demonstrated its feasibility for gene delivery
and cell administration [7]. This procedure carries, however, several risks mostly related to the invasive nature of the injection procedure itself. Perforation at the injection sites inside the left
ventricle (LV) could be harmful in patients with thinned and
scarred myocardia, causing cardiac tamponade. Cardiac arrhythmias may also arise secondary to tissue inflammation [6]. In addition, open thoracotomy and the general anesthesia, even with a
minimally invasive surgical approach, constitutes a significant risk
of morbi-mortality. Finally, besides the risks, this procedure presents some drawbacks, namely a limited access to certain areas of
the left ventricle such as the septum. It can also cause leakage of
the vectors from the injection sites, which can result in decreased
vector retention and minimized but still significant exposure of the
vectors to off-target organs.
The percutaneous approach offers an alternative that preserves
the characteristics of intramyocardial delivery, but without the risks
specific to the open-chest surgery. Both animal and clinical studies
report its feasibility and safe use [8]. There are few data comparing
both direct methods, but in a swine cell injection study,
percutaneous endomyocardial injection was associated with a
better total cell retention than surgical epicardial injection [9].
Similarly, several studies have shown a better cell retention with

Intramyocardial Injection

239

direct intramyocardial injection compared to intracoronary infusion
[3]. LV septum can be also targeted by this method. Considering
the extensive use of coronary catheterization procedures, this
approach thus appears to be preferable to surgery for the delivery
of vectors, as it is less invasive and easier to implement in the
clinical setting.
Catheter-based needle myocardial injection is associated with
equivalent or even superior transduction efficiency compared to
surgical injection [9, 10].
There are currently five catheter-based devices used in clinical
trials for gene and cell therapies: four intended for a transendocardial approach (Helix™, MyoCath™, Myostar™, Stiletto™) and one
designed for an epicardial approach via the coronary sinus
(TransAccess Delivery System™). All of these devices have been
shown to be effective and safe in both animals and clinical studies.
Their composition comprises a core element, terminated distally in
an injection needle with a variable shape, dedicated to the delivery
of the vectors. The core is protected by a support catheter which
helps to direct it toward the myocardial area of interest. MyoCath™
and Myostar™ catheters utilize an integrated system, meaning that
the core and support catheters are combined into a single unit,
whereas Helix™, Stiletto™ and TransAccess™ have separate core
and support units [11]. Endomyocardial methods may have limited access to the myocardium in the area of the submitral valve
apparatus while the right coronary territory is difficult to access
with the transcoronary sinus approach. The interpersonal variability of coronary sinus anatomy may render the procedure more
complex for the latter, whereas ventricular wall mobility may cause
instability of the catheter in the case of endomyocardial approach.
The transcoronary sinus approach allows parallel vector injection,
which may result in greater vector retention compared to the injection perpendicular to the LV wall. Vector leakage may also occur
into the LV cavity with the endocardial approach [9], and from the
coronary sinus mostly to the lungs.
Procedures are performed under different imaging guidance
modalities for determining the injection site including fluoroscopy
[12], echocardiography [13], intravascular ultrasound [14], electric mapping systems [15], and magnetic resonance imaging [16].
Several authors believe that the electromechanical mapping-guided
approach allows for better deployment of the tip of the catheter
around areas of ischemia [10, 17]. It also allows to assess electromechanical function that help distinguish between normal, ischemic and infarcted myocardium, and is therefore useful to identify
the areas of interest and guide the catheter towards them more
accurately. These characteristics explain why this approach, in
particular the NOGA mapping system, is the most frequently used
in clinical trials [18–22]. However, the system is quite complex
and expensive, and no imaging guidance is currently more recommended than another.

Methods

3.1 Surgical
Procedure

1. The procedure should be performed after an overnight fast.
Prophylactic antibiotic is given an hour before the beginning
of the procedure and analgesia.
2. The animal is anesthetized, intubated, and placed on the ventilator in right lateral recumbency (see Note 1 and Fig. 2).
Connect the monitors to the animal. The thoracic area is then
clipped and scrubbed in preparation for surgery.
3. Locate the target intercostal space by palpation of the left chest
(see Note 2). Perform intercostal nerve block with an approved
local anesthesia drug on the left side of the chest.
4. Create a 8–10 cm incision on the skin on top of the fourth intercostal space, approximately centered on both sides of the horizontal level which passes through the left shoulder joint
(beginning ~5 cm lateral to the sternum in a pig weighing
~10 kg, which is outside of the operating field and therefore
hidden). Dissect the muscular layers to enter the thoracic cavity.
Achieve hemostasis using a cautery pen (see Note 3).
5. Expand the surgical field by using two small rib spreaders
perpendicular to one another. The larger the surgical window is,
the easier it is to perform injection. However, a larger scar will
increase the risk of infection and invasiveness. Pay special attention not to damage the lung and the pericardial sac (see Note 4).

Fig. 3 Direct myocardial injection with a surgical epicardial approach. The bent
part of the 27 G L-shaped needle is inserted into the target myocardium while
applying pressure on a draining coronary vein

6. Delicately push back the left lung. Open up the pericardial sac
after retracting it away from the myocardium and expose the
heart (see Note 5).
7. Optimize the surgical window for good manipulation of the
heart with a good view (see Note 6). By direct visualization of
the heart, identify the area of interest.
8. Prepare (second operator) the vectors in injection syringes
(see Notes 6 and 7).
9. Insert the bent part of the 27 G L-shaped needle into the target
myocardium, taking care not to injure the epicardial coronary
vessels (see Note 8). Before injection, check the absence of
blood return after aspiration with the syringe. Inject vectors
slowly (see Notes 9–13 and Fig. 3). Continuously monitor
ECG throughout the procedure since multiple direct injections
sometimes cause ventricular fibrillation (see Note 14).
10. Create ~1 cm skin incision caudal at the second intercostal
space from the injection space and place a silicon thoracic drain
tube through this incision into the thoracic space.
11. After verifying the absence of bleeding inside the thoracic
cavity, close layer by layer, using bioabsorbable sutures. Buried
suturing will circumvent a later knock down of the animal to
remove sutures.
12. Aspirate air from the chest cavity through the silicon thoracic
drain tube.

Intramyocardial Injection

243

13. Withdraw the silicon thoracic drain tube while keeping a negative
pressure and close the incision using a nylon suture. This will
create an airtight chest cavity.
14. Clean the surgical sites in sterile manner. Apply triple antibiotic
ointment to prevent infection of the scar before covering it
with waterproof transparent dressings.
3.2 Percutaneous
Procedure Using
Fluoroscopy

1. The procedure should be performed after an overnight fasting.
Premedication comprises intravenous prophylactic antibiotic
an hour before the beginning of the procedure and analgesia.
2. The animal is anesthetized, intubated, and placed on the ventilator in supine recumbent position.
3. Scrub the groin (and/or) the neck with Betadine and alcohol
solution for disinfecting.
4. Obtain an access to the femoral or carotid artery with the Seldinger
technique and insert an 8-F arterial sheath (see Note 15).
5. Administer heparin at the dose of 100 U/kg IV. Supplements
are added as needed to maintain an activated clotting time of
200–250 s throughout the procedure.
6. Advance the guide wire with the guiding catheter to the arterial system. This will prevent accidental damage to the aorta.
Special care should be taken when the guiding catheter passes
the aortic arch.
7. A 6-F pig-tail catheter is advanced to the aortic valve in a retrograde fashion. After crossing the aortic valve, its tip is
directed toward the apex within the LV cavity. Left ventriculography is then performed in left anterior oblique (LAO) 30°
and right anterior oblique (RAO) 90° views (see Note 16).
8. After completion of LV angiography, the 6-F catheter is
replaced by the 8-F injection catheter, the distal tip of which
incorporates a 27 G needle that can be advanced or retracted
(see Note 17). Before insertion, the catheter is flushed with a
sterile heparinised saline.
9. The injection catheter is oriented to the target myocardial area
using fluoroscopic guidance. Once a stable position is attained,
the injection needle is extended 4–6 mm into the target myocardium. Inject vector slowly. Wait for a short period before removing the needle in order to minimize washout (see Note 18).
10. The volume of solution injected as well as the time of infusion
is dependent upon the device used (see Note 19). However,
exceeding 100 μL/single injection site may result in lower vector retention.
11. After completion of each injection, the needle is retracted and
the catheter is moved to another endocardial site. Injections
should be at least 5 mm apart.

244

Guillaume Bonnet et al.

12. Withdraw the sheath from the artery and achieve hemostasis
by applying direct pressure to the arterial access site for several
minutes (see Note 20).
13. Clean the puncture site in sterile manner and apply triple antibiotic ointment to prevent infection.

Notes
1. Inserting a thick surgical towel under the chest will raise the
heart in the surgical area and facilitate injection procedures.
2. A left thoractomy provides a good surgical view of the anterior
to lateral wall of the LV. The fourth intercostal space is suited
for a naive heart without dilation, whereas the fifth intercostal
space may be more suitable for a dilated heart after MI. If
fluoroscopy is available in the operation room, visualization of
the silhouette of the heart helps to determine an appropriate
access site.
3. When entering the chest cavity, be careful not to injure the
lung. Cutting the pleural membrane during the exhalation will
reduce the risk of lung injury.
4. When dissecting the intercostal tissue, be careful not to damage the internal thoracic artery.
5. To facilitate heart exposure and minimize the risk of lung
injury, the inspiratory volume on mechanical ventilator may be
reduced during this operating time.
6. Pre-shaping the needle to curved or L shape will facilitate a
more stable injection on the beating heart and prevent puncturing through the myocardium.
7. Pre-operative echocardiograms can determine the thickness of
the LV wall. Left ventriculograms and coronary angiograms
may help locating the infarct zone.
8. Inserting a wet gauze under the heart may sometimes facilitate
the injection procedures. Do not forget to remove the gauze
after the procedure.
9. The total volume for each injection site should not exceed 100 μL.
10. Applying pressure on a draining coronary vein will increase the
vector dwelling time. However, it will increase the intramyocardial pressure and can cause ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. The coronary sinus can be compressed for each injection,
but should be released before the next injection.
11. Placing a suture for reference may help identify the injection
site at the chronic stage. However, detailed notes together
with epicardial vessel pictures can substitute this without causing extra injury on the heart.

Fig. 4 Placing a mattress suture and injection inside the area surrounded by the suture. Left: Placing a mattress
suture on an area without epicardial vessels. Right: Injection inside the area delimited by the mattress suture

12. Placing a mattress suture may increase the vector retention
[23], however this is technically difficult and can be applied
on a very limited area where no epicardial vessels are present
(see Fig. 4).
13. Potential utility of sealing of the epicardial injection site with
fibrin glue and reduction of ventricular rate by IV adenosine
for the purpose of increasing cell retention have been suggested [7].
14. When ventricular fibrillation occurs, manually pump the heart
while the assistant prepares for direct current shock. Apply a
10–20 J shock directly on the heart to restore sinus rhythm.
15. The femoral and the carotid arteries can also be accessed by a
cut down method.
16. The LAO projection identifies the basal lateral, mid-lateral,
apical lateral, apical septal, mid-septal and basal septal
segments. The RAO projection identifies the anterior basal,
mid-anterior, apical anterior, inferior, mid-inferior, and inferior
basal segments.
17. Using a steerable guide sheath can increase stability of catheter
position and facilitate injection procedures.
18. Note that in a clinical study, direct intramyocardial injections
of genes and stem cells were followed by a minor release of
cardiac biomarkers of myocardial damage, whereas intraventricular catheter movements in relation to a diagnostic electromechanical mapping procedure do not seem to lead to enzyme
release exceeding the normal upper limits [24].

19. The electrocardiographic monitoring detects premature
ventricular beats as evidence of needle penetration into the
myocardium. Note that puncture of a nonviable myocardium
may not generate premature ventricular beats. Under electromechanical mapping guidance, injections are made into ischemic
areas, suggested by the combination of preserved voltage and
abnormal wall motion.
20. Protamine may be used to reverse heparin unless there are known
counteractions with the vectors. Protamine should be injected
after the removal of the sheath to prevent acute thrombus formation inside the vessels. Inject protamine slowly as it can cause
hypotension.

Selective Pressure-Regulated Retroinfusion for Gene
Therapy Application in Ischemic Heart Disease
Rabea Hinkel and Christian Kupatt
Abstract
Coronary heart disease is still the leading cause of death in industrialized nations. Even though revascularization strategies such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention and enhanced
drug therapy significantly improved the outcome, about 30 % of patients develop chronic heart failure.
Ischemic heart disease and heart failure are characterized by an adverse remodeling of the heart, featuring
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, increased fibrosis and capillary rarefaction. Therefore, gene therapeutic
approaches for the treatment of heart failure, such as the modulating contractile function or therapeutic
neovascularization, seem to be promising. To achieve an efficient transduction of the gene therapeutic agent,
the time point and the application route seem to be important for the therapeutic success. In contrast to the
classical systemic application regional intra-coronary application offers the possibility of higher transduction
efficacy in the target area accompanied by a reduced off-target contamination. Antegrade delivery however,
may be impaired by coronary heart disease, such as stenosis or occlusion of a coronary artery. Coronary veins
appear not to be affected and might therefore be the preferable application route for gene therapy. For an
effective and safe retrograde application in gene therapy, selective catheterization of the coronary vein draining the target area is necessary. In addition, to avoid coronary vein injury, a pressure regulated infusion
enhances safety. Therefore, a selective pressure regulation of retroinfusion (SSR) seems to be a favorable
approach for gene therapy transduction in combination with reduced systemic contamination.

Introduction
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is still the leading cause of death in
western world countries. It is caused by atherosclerotic plaque formation in a coronary artery and treated with interventional or surgical revascularization therapy, thereby improving cardiac-specific
mortality [1–3]. As of today, despite current strategies of rapid
percutaneous revascularization, still 30 % of patients with acute
myocardial infarction will develop chronic heart failure over time
[4]. Although drug therapy with antiplatelet agents, angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors and lipid lowering agents has
improved the outcome following revascularization within the last

years, the demand for primary and secondary prevention is large
[5, 6]. For the USA, total costs (direct and indirect) for heart
failure treatment will increase from $30.7 billion in 2012 to an
estimated number of $69.8 billion in 2030 [7]. Moreover, a growing number of patients have exhausted interventional and surgical
procedures of revascularization, but still suffer from angina. Hence,
a molecular revascularization approach, such as gene-therapeutic
neovascularization appears warranted.
Gene therapy for induction of neovascularization is not established in clinical settings up to date, mostly because of a lack of
evidence of its efficacy. First generation attempts have included
naked DNA and adenoviral formulations of vascular growth factor
[8]. However, significant improvements have been made during
the last decade, redefining the essentials of vascular gene therapy.
Besides utilization of long-acting, low-immunogenic adenoassociated viruses (AAVs), balanced vascular growth has been
developed, which provides vessel maturation in addition to capillary growth (e.g., [9, 10]).
In addition to the choice of the therapeutic agent, the application route seems of utmost importance. There are basically two
different types of application: systemic and regional application.
The regional catheter based administration can be divided into
antegrade and a retrograde application [11, 12]. The antegrade
application, however, has the disadvantage of utilizing the diseased
vessel with a limited access to the target area and an altered transduction/uptake of the therapeutic agent. Therefore the retrograde
approach seems to be favorable for patients with CAD, since in this
case the venous tree that is not altered by the disease is used for
assessing the ischemic/target region of the left ventricle [11, 12]
(Fig. 1a). For an effective and safe retrograde application in gene
therapy various application approaches are used: (1) The selective
pressure-regulated retroinfusion system (SSR) [9, 13–16]; (2) The
modified selective retroinfusion [17–19] and (3) The Retrograde
coronary venous infusion [20]. In contrast to the SSR application
the modified selective retroinfusion utilizes a 7-F balloon wedgepressure catheter for the venous side. Application is performed in
three periods each 3 min with a blocked AIV while the left anterior
descending coronary artery (LAD) is occluded distal of the first
diagonal branch. The retrograde coronary venous infusion blocks
in addition the distal site of the AIV via an 1.5 mm over the wire
balloon. SSR uses a pressure regulated infusion to avoid coronary
vein injury, enhancing the safety. The SSR-system for retrograde
delivery of therapeutics, such as medication or peptides [21, 22],
cDNA [16, 23, 24], miRNA-inhibitor [25] and gene therapeutic
agents [9, 15, 26, 27] has already been shown to be efficient and
safe in preclinical pig models. Boekstegers and coworkers could
show that the SSR system can be used safely in the clinical situation
[13, 28]. In addition, for gene therapy, SSR offers a more

Methods

3.1 Venous
and Arterial Assess

1. For the venous and arterial assess, the animals are placed in supine
position and the legs are tied down, the neck region is shaved,
scrubbed and draped in preparation for surgery (see Note 1).
2. Perform a 3 cm neck skin incision; here (1) the center of the incision is the middle of the triangle defined by the mandibular
angle, (2) the shoulder joint and (3) the tip of the sternum is
used as guidance. After incision of skin, subcutaneous fat and the
subcutaneous muscle layer, the Musculus sternocleidomastoideus is used as guidance. On the medial part of the muscle the
carotid artery is prepared and an 8F sheath is introduced into the
cranially ligated common carotid artery via an introducer.
3. After successful introduction of the sheath, connect it to a
monitor system allowing for pressure measurement. On the
lateral side of the muscle, the external jugular vein is prepared
and introduce an 11F sheath into the vein.
4. Then 10,000 IE heparin is applied systemically (acute clotting
time (ACT) > 250 s) (see Note 2).
5. Before catheterization of the coronary artery a systemic infusion of saline solution including magnesium 1000 mg and
amiodarone hydrochloride 150 mg is applied.

3.2 Blocking
of the Antegrade Flow
in Coronary Arteries

In order to achieve an optimal transfection efficacy up to the distal
parts of the vein including the side branches, the antegrade flow
needs to be blocked for the retroinfusion time. This step is not
applicable in protocols where the coronary artery is already
occluded (see Subheading 3.4).
1. For blocking either the LAD or the RCx, a Judkins right 7F with
side wholes is needed. Connect the catheter to the Y-adapter and
the 3 port manifold set/contrast syringe (Fig. 2a). After carefully
flushing the catheter system with saline it is introduced into the
8F sheath in the A. carotis communis.
2. Adjust the X-ray to the heart and valve area and proceed the
catheter forward till the height of the aortic arch. Here the tip
of the catheter is torqued to the right side and further moved
towards the left ventricle.
3. After passing the aortic arch branching, the catheter tip is
turned to the left side and carefully advanced into the left main
coronary artery (Fig. 3a).

Fig. 3 Example of a selective pressure-regulated retroinfusion (SSR) into the anterior intraventricular vein (AIV).
(a) Angiography of the left ventricular descending artery (LAD) and the ramus circumflexus (RCx) as indicated
by the red arrows (LAO 30°). The antegrade flow is blocked by a balloon in the LAD distal to the first diagonal
branch and the SSR catheter is in position for the retrograde application. (b) Angiography of the coronary vein
through the SSR catheter (LAO 30°). This catheter is placed into the proximal AIV and blocked at the tip.
Contrast agent is applied in the same manner as the gene therapy and shows a good distal filling of the AIV
and its branches, allowing for effective transduction in the target area (the LAD perfused cardiac tissue)

4. Take an angiography of the coronary arteries via the 3-port
manifold set/contrast syringe system to visualize the branching of the left coronary arteries (Fig. 3a).
5. Insert the 0.014″ guide wire into the JR catheter via the insertion tool and push forward to the tip of the catheter. After
reaching of the catheter tip with the wire, rotate the catheter
tip in the direction of the coronary artery (LAD) and the wire
is forwarded into the LAD (Fig. 3a). If needed attach the
torque handle to the distal end of the 0.014″ guide wire and
rotate to allow for placement in the LAD.
6. Connect the balloon to the balloon inflation device (filled with
50 % saline: 50 % contrast agent, Fig. 2a).
7. Proceed the balloon along the 0.014″ guide wire to the tip of
the catheter. For positioning the balloon in the LAD (distal to
the first diagonal branch, in order to avoid ventricular fibrillation) the balloon is pushed forward while holding the wire in
the same position.
8. Assure the correct positioning of the balloon by X-ray
(Fig. 3a).

1. First of all flush a 6F Cournand catheter with saline solution
and introduce into the venous sheath.
2. Position the C-arm X-ray, such that the heart including the superior vena cava and the aorta are visible upon X-ray. The catheter
is pushed forward until passing the right atrium and rotated, such
that the tip of the catheter points to the left ventricle.
3. The catheter is moved carefully forward until the tip flips into
the vena azygos (V. azygos). The great cardiac vein, which is
needed to enter in order to move the catheter into the direction of the AIV, exits from the V. azygos where this turns in a
90° angle cranially. After inserting the Cournand catheter into
the great cardiac vein, inject the contrast agent to depict the
venous system (see Note 3).
4. Introduce the 0.018″ guide into the Cournand catheter via the
guide wire insertion tool (avoiding damage in the sensitive tip of
the wire) and push it forward into the great cardiac vein. Attach
the torque handle to the wire directly before the Y-adapter and
while softly twisting the wire, further push forward to the distal
part of the AIV.
5. After ensuring a secure position of the guide wire, withdraw the
Cournand catheter, while keeping the guide wire in its position.
After removal of the Cournand catheter, the specific four-lumen
SSR-catheter (Fig. 2b) is introduced into the vein via the guide
wire (see Note 4). For this purpose the guide wire is inserted in
the infusion or suction line at the tip of the SSR-catheter.
6. Then use the guide wire as guidance for the SSR-catheter and
push forward till the proximal AIV. After correct positioning of
the SSR-catheter in the AIV, remove the guide wire carefully.
7. After inflating the balloon (at the tip of the SSR-catheter, 1 ml
air) the correct localization and the anatomic structure of the
AIV is visualized via a single shot contrast agent (Fig. 3b).

3.4 Selective
Pressure-Regulated
Retroinfusion of Gene
Therapy

1. Dilute the gene therapeutic agent in 15 ml saline solution in a
perfusor syringe. Place the syringe into a perfusor and connect
to the infusion line of the SSR-catheter via a perfusor line. Set
the infusion velocity of the perfusor to 99 ml/h allowing for a
continuous infusion over 10 min. Over an additional line connected to the SSR-catheter infusion lumen via 3-way-stop-cock
(Figs. 1b and 2b) the infusomate is connected. This has an
infusion solution reservoir with an infusion pump and a valve
system for pressure regulated infusion.
2. Connect the pressure line of the SSR-catheter to a pressure
measurement device.
3. Then first occlude the LAD (6–8 atm) followed by the SSRcatheter balloon (1.5 ml air) to determine the occlusion pressure
in the AIV (see Notes 5 and 6). The infusion pressure reached

256

Rabea Hinkel and Christian Kupatt

in the blocked AIV should be not more than 20 mmHg above
the measured occlusion pressure to prevent hemorrhagic
damage of the vein and the surrounding tissue (see Note 7).
4. Start the infusion via inflow from the high-pressure reservoir.
It will be immediately interrupted by a valve upon reaching the
predefined infusion pressure. Administration is carried out in a
pressure controlled manner and can be varied from interval,
and infusion time/heart beat allowing for an optimized contact time. Altogether, occlusion time of the LAD should not
exceed 10 min, to prevent ischemic injury of the myocardial
tissue.
3.5 Selective
Pressure-Regulated
Retroinfusion
of the Middle Cardiac
Vein

In case the RCx perfused area is the target area, the middle cardiac
vein is utilized for the retroinfusion, e.g., in the chronic ischemic
protocol displayed in Fig. 4a [9, 15, 26, 27].
1. Introduce the Cournand catheter and the 0.018″ guide wire as
described in Subheading 3.3. In addition place a 0.014″ guide
wire in the AIV before the Cournand catheter is removed.
2. Place the balloon (3.5–4 mm) in the proximal part of the AIV
using the 0.014″ guide catheter as guidance (Fig. 4b).

Fig. 4 Example of a selective pressure-regulated retroinfusion (SSR) into the middle cardiac vein. (a)
Angiography of the left ventricular descending artery (LAD) and the ramus circumflexus (RCx) as indicated by
the red arrows (LAO 30°). In the ramus circumflexus (RCx) a reduction stent is implanted at day 0 as displayed
here, leading to a complete occlusion at time of retroinfusion (day 28 after implantation, not shown). The antegrade flow is blocked by the occluded stent in the distal RCx. (b) Angiography of the coronary vein through the
SSR catheter. This catheter is placed into the great cardiac vein and blocked at the tip. In addition, to allow only
for middle cardiac vein transduction, a PTCA balloon is placed in the proximal AIV, blocking flow from the distal
AIV. Contrast agent is applied in the same manner as the gene therapy and shows a good retention in the
middle cardiac vein, allowing for effective transduction in the target area (the RCx perfused cardiac tissue)

3. Introduce the SSR-catheter into the great cardiac vein as
described in Subheading 3.3. Correct placement of the SSRcatheter and the balloon in the proximal AIV is monitored via
X-ray and the occlusion pressure is measured while both, the
SSR- and the AIV balloons are inflated (Fig. 4b). SSR is performed as described above.

Notes
1. Animal size
The animals used for the SSR application of gene therapy should
have a size of 20–25 kg body weight, to assure that the coronary
vessels have a sufficient size. If the animals are lighter than 20 kg
body weight, there is a high risk that the AIV diameter is too
small to introduce the SSR catheter into the proximal AIV.
When the catheter is not introduced far enough into the AIV,
the gene therapy is not applied selectively to the LAD perfused
area but also to the RCX perfused area.
2. Activated clotting time (ACT) and embolic events
Before starting the catheterization of the animals, 10,000 IE of
heparin is applied with a target ACT time of >250 s. During
the experiment, especially if time needed for catheterization is
prolonged, the ACT should be controlled every 30 min and
heparin reapplied if the ACT is <250 s. Controlling the clotting time is utmost important, since a reduced clotting time
increases the risk of embolism, especially pulmonary embolism
in case of the venous catheterization.
3. Vessel malformations
In rare cases, a vessel malformation, especially on the venous
side is observed. These malformations include an unusual
branching point of the great cardiac vein itself or a diffuse
branching of the AIV. In both cases the animals cannot be used
for the SSR-mediated gene therapy and need to be excluded
from the study.
4. Valves in the coronary venous system
The venous system contains valves, which might hamper the
coronary venous catheterization. In pig hearts, there often
occur venous valves at the branching point of the V. azygos
and the great cardiac vein. To still introduce the catheter into
the great cardiac vein or AIV, the SSR-catheter is placed
directly in front of the valve. Then inflate the balloon of the
catheter, the catheter is cautiously pushed towards the valve
and rapidly deflate the balloon. This procedure might be
repeated several times till the SSR catheter is introduced to the
great cardiac vein.

5. Arrhythmias due to arterial occlusion
Catheterization and intervention of the coronary arteries carries the risk of arrhythmias (especially in pig protocols), such
as ventricular extra beats, ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. These events might occur upon coronary
artery blockade for retroinfusion. To minimize the risk of
these adverse events, anti-arrhythmic medication (magnesium 1000 mg and amiodarone hydrochloride 150 mg) is
added to the systemic saline infusion before starting the
catheterization. If these arrhythmias still occur, the correct
localization of the coronary artery balloon should be verified. In addition, the coronary artery balloon might be
inserted more distally, thereby reducing the ischemic area
and the arrhythmias.
6. Shunt veins in the coronary venous system
After successful introduction of the SSR-catheter and blocking
of the coronary vein and artery an angiography should be performed to estimate the retention time of the solution in the
coronary vein. If this retention time is short (direct wash-out of
the contrast agent), there might be shunt veins in the coronary
venous system. In case the shunt occurs at the proximal part of
the AIV the SSR-catheter might be introduced more distally
into the vein. If the shunt vein occurs in the distal part of the
vein, either the preset pressure of the reservoir and the infusion
pressure might be reduced. If this does not improve the
washout of the contrast agent and improve the retention time,
the selective pressure-regulated retroinfusion for gene therapy
cannot be performed efficiently and the animal should be
excluded from the study.
7. Hemorrhagic damage in the coronary veins
Hemorrhagic damage of the coronary vein may occur through
the catheterization itself or an over-pressure in the SSRballoon. To prevent any injury and hemorrhagic damage of the
coronary vein, the catheters and wires should be handled with
care avoiding too much pressure. The balloon of the SSR catheter should be inflated with maximum 1.5 ml air, until an
increased resistance of the syringe used for blocking is observed.
In case of an uncomplete occlusion of the AIV, the balloon
should be deflated, the 0.018″ wire should be reintroduced
and the SSR-catheter moved more distally into the AIV. After
the procedure, before removing the SSR-catheter the integrity
of the vein should be verified by injecting contrast agent into
the infusion line of the SSR-catheter. If a dissection of the coronary vein is observed, the animal should be excluded from
the study, since an effective application of the gene therapy is
not assured.

Cardiac Gene Delivery Using Recirculating Devices
Melissa J. Byrne and David M. Kaye
Abstract
Cardiac gene delivery has become an important issue following the emergence of gene therapy for the
possible treatment of heart failure. Despite many advances in the management of heart failure (HF), treatment options for many patients with advanced HF remain limited. At a cellular and molecular level, many
of the fundamental alterations that contribute to the pathogenesis of HF are becoming better understood
and this has resulted in the discovery of new therapeutic targets in animal models of HF, in particular in
the area of gene therapy.
Numerous small animal and preclinical studies have examined the efficacy of delivering genes targeting various signaling pathways that are affected as the heart fails. However, the translation of this work into
the clinic has been difficult due to the requirement for large scale targeted delivery of the gene. This methods chapter describes a percutaneous method of recirculation that we have employed to successfully deliver
potential therapeutic agents, including genes, to the heart.

Introduction
Despite pharmacologic advances in the treatment of heart failure
(HF), mortality and morbidity remain unacceptably high.
Moreover, for patients with end stage heart failure therapeutic
options are limited to heart transplantation and possibly long-term
mechanical circulatory support. However, these options are not
appropriate for many patients with advanced HF when associated
with other comorbid diseases. Accordingly there has been a growing interest in the exploration of alternative approaches for the
management of the end-stage HF patient. In particular, the development of a detailed understanding of the cellular and molecular
pathophysiology of HF has led to a resurgence and growth in the
potential role of gene and cellular therapies for HF.
The failing myocardium is characterized by progressive changes
in a complex array of genes related to excitation contraction coupling, myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. While the use
of gene transfer approaches to increase the expression of other

dysregulated genes [1, 2] or to inhibit the effects of over expressed
genes or proteins appears promising, a number of barriers exist in
the translation of these potential therapies to the clinic. In particular, the development of a broadly applicable approach for gene
delivery that provides the maximal potential for local delivery
together with the use of viral vectors that can provide an appropriate balance between myocardial tropism, cellular transgene expression and safety, remains a challenge. Moreover, the optimization of
these approaches for each therapeutic transgene will be an
important determinant of their therapeutic success.
While both small and large animal studies provide firm support
for the potential use of gene therapy in the management of clinical
HF, several major issues require adequate resolution and optimization during clinical translation. One example of this is the recent
completion of a Phase2b clinical trial examining the efficacy of
adeno-associated virus serotype 1 carrying sarcoplasmic reticulum
Ca2+-ATPase 2a (AAV1.SERCA2a) delivered via intracoronary
infusion to heart failure patients (CUPID2, [3]), which did not
meet its primary or secondary endpoints.
Two complementary components, the choice of delivery vector together with the mode of delivery are important factors in
determining the level of cardiac gene transfer. This is a particularly
important consideration in the context of vector dose in the translation from small animal gene delivery outcomes to preclinical
large animal and human studies. As such, a key aim is to optimize
myocardial transgene expression while limiting systemic expression, and where possible limiting the vector dose required to
provide optimal hemodynamic benefit.
A number of percutaneous mechanical methods for the delivery of genes have been described, including intracoronary (antegrade) [4] or retrograde infusion [5], and intramyocardial injection
[6]. In addition, a surgical method of delivering genes during
cardiopulmonary bypass has been developed (molecular cardiac
surgery with recirculating delivery; MCARD, [7]). Each of these
techniques encompasses a portfolio of advantages and risks which
have been reviewed by Ishikawa and colleagues [8].
For the management of heart failure, the ideal delivery mode
should provide global and prolonged exposure to the transgene
that safely maintains the homeostasis of the heart. On this basis we
previously compared the functional benefit of cardiac AAV-SERCA
delivery, administered either via the intracoronary or recirculation
route. In that study we showed that only AAV-SERCA recirculation improved cardiac function, consistent with the fact that the
myocardial transit time following simple intracoronary injection is
typically of the order of 10–15 s [9].
The recirculating delivery technique described in this methods
chapter employs a percutaneous technique for recirculating gene

Cardiac Recirculation

263

delivery to the heart called the V-Focus system (Osprey Medical
Inc, Minnetonka, MN). By producing a catheterization based
recirculation pathway for gene delivery we aimed to increase the
exposure time of the agent to the myocardium in order to increase
transgene expression and where possible to limit off-target
exposure.
We have previously employed this approach in the large animal
failing heart to deliver gene therapy directed towards restoration
of SERCA2a and phospholamban [10, 11], each affording functional benefit. The V-Focus system has been designed to substantially isolate the coronary circulation from the general circulation,
with minimal disturbance to the existing cardiac function and in
doing so it allowing agents to be introduced into the heart circulation. The system is intended to minimize exposure of the therapeutic agent into the systemic circulation and to maximize
myocardial uptake. The only unavoidable loss from the circuit
occurs via the Thebesian veins, which communicate directly with
the cardiac chambers and not with the coronary sinus. In most
patients, the blood flow to these vessels is less than 10 % of the
total coronary circulation.
This method can be used in large animal models of heart failure
including sheep [10, 11], pigs, and dogs, and while this chapter
describes the use of the circuit for administration of gene therapy,
it has also been employed for cell delivery to the heart [12] and
antibiotic delivery to the lower limb [13].

achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) adequate for extracorporeal support (>250 s).
2. Tuohy Borst hemostasis valves are connected to both the
recovery and perfusion catheters to minimize bleeding. Use a
high-flow stopcock on the side arm of the hemostasis valves,
which connects to the circuit venous and arterial lines.
3. Prime the coronary sinus recovery catheter balloon (via a 3-way
stopcock) according to standard interventional procedures and
decompress the balloon.
4. Cannulate the coronary sinus utilizing standard interventional
cardiology techniques (see Note 4).
5. Introduce the coronary sinus recovery catheter into the coronary sinus until the catheter tip is at least 15 mm into the coronary sinus or proximal end of the balloon is positioned
approximately 2–4 mm into the ostia (see Note 5).
6. Perform a contrast venogram of the coronary sinus to establish
size and catheter position.
7. Inflate the occlusion balloon to occlude and check for contrast
leakage. (Note: Inflate the balloon using diluted contrast
medium (50 % contrast)).

8. Under fluoroscopic guidance, insert the coronary sinus support
device through the coronary sinus recovery catheter. The
coronary sinus support device will self deploy (expand) into the
coronary sinus creating a scaffold around the tip of the catheter
(Note: The proximal end of the device should remain flush with
the distal tip of the coronary sinus recovery catheter).
9. The 7Fr coronary artery catheter is advanced via the catheter
introducer sheath in the carotid artery following standard
interventional cardiology procedures, to the coronary artery
ostium and the 0.014″ positioned in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery to stabilize the catheter.
10. Once the two catheter systems are in place they are linked via
the perfusion system.
3.3 Connection
of the Catheters
into the Circuit

1. Open the sterile manifold package and hand lines into the
sterile field.
2. Apply tubing clamps to both arms of the red arterial line and
to the blue venous line and discard manifold.
3. Attach blue venous line to the coronary sinus recovery catheter;
take care to ensure that connection is air free.
4. Remove tubing clamp from the venous line.
5. Attach one arm of the arterial line to the coronary artery
perfusion catheter in the left coronary artery. Again ensure the
connection is air free and do not remove the clamp.
6. Attach second arm of arterial line to the collection bag and
remove clamp.
7. Zero the venous pressure monitoring transducer.
8. Turn gas flow on to 500 ml/min.
9. Switch pump on.
10. Slowly increase the pump flow up to 50 ml/min.
11. Check to see that blood is entering the venous line and verify
that the oxygenator is filling with blood and the blood exiting
is bright red (oxygenated).
12. Continue transfusing until all lines are blood filled and the
priming saline enters the collection bag. During this time,
optimize the flow rate to maintain an appropriate negative
pressure within the circuit.
13. When the blood has back filled the circuit, inflate the recovery
catheter balloon (and azygous catheter balloon if used,
see Note 5), close off the collection bag and open the coronary
artery catheter.
14. Inflate coronary sinus recovery catheter balloon and azygous
catheter balloon if in use—the circuit is now closed and the
patient’s blood is recirculating through the coronary vasculature.

Cardiac Recirculation

267

15. Slowly increase the pump flow to 100 ml/min.
16. Monitor venous inlet pressure until pressure stabilizes. Ensure
pressure is negative and does not exceed −100 mmHg. (If negative pressure exceeds −100 mmHg, check position of coronary
sinus recovery catheter and support device and lower the flow
rate if necessary) (see Note 6).
17. Monitor the electrocardiogram for changes.
18. Recirculate for 1 min to ensure circuit and animal stability.
19. Once confirmed that flow rate is optimal in relation to negative
pressure within the circuit add the agent to be delivered at the
port distal to the oxygenator at a rate that matches the flow
rate of the pump—this prevents blowing out of the fluid and/or
movement of the distal tip of the catheter that can occur due
to abrupt changes in pressure.
20. Follow agent with an additional 5 ml of saline to clear the line
at the rate matching pump flow rate.
21. Following delivery of the agent, recirculate for 10 min (or as
protocol for the particular agent dictates). If negative pressure
increases beyond −100 mmHg during recirculation, open thumb
wheel on IV administration set and deliver bolus of 20 ml of
saline or optionally, reduce follow rate, or small boluses (5–10 ml)
of saline may be administered as required.
3.4

Procedural End

1. At the end of recirculation, capture of the circuit volume of
blood (200 ml), to further minimize systemic exposure of the
agent, can be achieved clamping the arterial line and re-diverting
the delivery of blood to the collection bag while maintaining a
lower pump flow of ~50 ml/min.
2. Once the circuit volume has been collected, the pump can be
turned off, recovery balloon deflated and the wire, support
device and catheters removed from the heart following standard
interventional cardiology procedures.
3. Introducer sheaths can then be removed and vessels sealed with
the purse string suture and the incision closed (2.0 cutting).
4. While the incision is closed, remove the circuit from pump and
discard according to institutional waste protocols.

4

Notes
1. During priming of the circuit it is essential that all air is removed
from the system and that the height of the oxygenator is maintained throughout the procedure to prevent the drawing in of
air from the oxygenator due to gravity.
2. Therefore, it is important to run the closed circuit following
priming with saline to confirm circuit patency.

268

3. This initial recirculation of saline will also allow the temperature
of the circuit to be stabilized at ~37 °C prior to connection to
the catheters.
4. To position the large coronary sinus catheter recovery catheter,
commercially available catheters, sheath and/or guide wire can
be used to facilitate cannulation. We use a 5Fr guide catheter
over an 0.035″ j-tip wire within the catheter. Coordination of
both the wire and the guide sheath facilitates locating and
engagement the CS ostium.
5. In both sheep and pigs the left azygous (hemiazygous) vein
drains directly into the coronary sinus (rather than emptying
into the superior vena cava as seen in dog and human hearts).
As such, it is necessary to position the distal tip and inflation
balloon are past azygous vein entrance. This will ensure that the
blood collected comes from the coronary circulation. If, due to
anatomical variations, it is not possible to get past this point, a
second balloon catheter (via a second jugular introducer sheath)
can be positioned in the vessel to prevent contribution of blood
to the circuit. This balloon catheter should be inflated at the
same time as the recovery catheter balloon.
6. During recirculation it is important that there is no change in
catheter position. Changes can alter the pressure within the
circuit, in particular: movement up against a vessel wall and
advancement of catheters too far into the lumen of the vessels
can increase negative pressure which can result in cavitation of
the tubing; and movement of the catheters out of the vessel
ostium can lead to loss of agent to systemic circulation.
Therefore, prior to connecting the circuit ensure that both
introducers and catheters are secure and stable.

Abstract
Despite progress in clinical treatment, cardiovascular diseases are still the leading cause of morbidity and
mortality worldwide. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are needed, targeting the underlying molecular mechanisms of disease with improved outcomes for patients. Gene therapy is one of the most promising fields for the development of new treatments for the advanced stages of cardiovascular diseases. The
establishment of clinically relevant methods of gene transfer remains one of the principal limitations on the
effectiveness of gene therapy. Recently, there have been significant advances in direct and transvascular
gene delivery methods. The ideal gene transfer method should be explored in clinically relevant large animal models of heart disease to evaluate the roles of specific molecular pathways in disease pathogenesis.
Characteristics of the optimal technique for gene delivery include low morbidity, an increased myocardial
transcapillary gradient, esxtended vector residence time in the myocytes, and the exclusion of residual vector from the systemic circulation after delivery to minimize collateral expression and immune response.
Here we describe myocardial gene transfer techniques with molecular cardiac surgery with recirculating
delivery in a large animal model of post ischemic heart failure.

Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are still the leading health problem in
industrialized countries in terms of morbidity and mortality [1].
The promise of gene therapy in the treatment of acquired and congenital heart and vascular disorders remains very high [2]. In the
last decade significant progress was achieved in various areas of
gene therapy research including therapeutic angiogenesis, cystic
fibrosis, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease [3]. However, many unresolved issues limit the clinical application of gene therapy. In general the effectiveness of gene therapy

is determined by a combination of gene delivery to the target
organ, transfection of the genetic material into specific cell types,
and the expression level of the transfected gene. Inadequate delivery and transfection efficiency has been one of the major limitations of gene therapy [4]. This efficiency can be improved with the
development of better gene-delivery methods and vectors [5]. To
this date, no delivery system or viral serotype has optimized cardio
tropism without collateral expression in other tissues [6]. A great
number of gene delivery techniques have been researched in cardiovascular gene therapy. Two major conclusions should be drawn
from the data: the physical route of gene delivery is no less important than the vector system, and gene delivery should be organ
targeted with minimal or optimally zero collateral expression. Gene
delivery strategies to the heart have included interventions using
either an intravascular approach through the coronary arteries or
direct delivery to cardiac muscle [7]. There is still no consensus on
which method of gene transfer is better: intramyocardial or intracoronary. Each of these methods has its positive and negative
aspects. In our view, both of them will be used in the future,
though perhaps for differing applications.
Direct intramyocardial injection of viral vectors is a technique
that can support sufficient myocardial delivery in different animal
models. The efficacy of this mode of cardiac gene delivery is limited by the accessibility of myocardial tissue and the areas injected
[8]. This mode of gene delivery is clinically acceptable only during
procedures where the myocardium is readily accessible. Unlike the
transvascular route, during direct delivery, transgene enters the
extracellular matrix and somatic cells, bypassing the blood compartment which includes plasma proteins, blood cells, and neutralizing antibodies which substantially inactivate the vector. Moreover,
this method allows for the application of high concentrations of
transgene directly at the target site. This approach has been successfully applied in animal models of ischemia, heart failure and
cardiac arrhythmias as well as several clinical trials to induce
therapeutic angiogenesis in coronary artery disease [9].
Intravenous administrationis the least invasive and simplest
route for gene transfer. It finds its application in the treatment of
systemic diseases such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia [10].
However, significant limitations of this technique include first-pass
pulmonary and hepatic uptake of vector as well as fast dilution in
blood circulation. The efficacy of intracoronary administration is
much better and this delivery is obviously clinically relevant and
appealing, although it cannot escape systemic leakage [11]. The use
of retrograde intracoronary transfer through the coronary sinus is
undoubtedly a step forward compared with a selective antegrade
intracoronary technique due to several factors [12]. First, it can be
more easily applied in patients with coronary artery disease. Second,
it allows for prolonged adhesion time of the vector to the cardiac
endothelium, and overcomes the resistance of precapillary sphincters

proximally located on the arterial side of the capillary bed. Finally, it
can reduce myocardial reperfusion injury. Intracoronary delivery has
shown limited transduction and varied results with systemic leakage
because of the single pass transvascular gene transfer with very fast
dilution of vector concentration in the circulating blood with subsequent gene and vector dissemination to collateral organs [13]. The
parameters need to be improved are: the contact time of vector in
coronary circulation, intravascular flow rate and perfusion pressure,
composition of perfusate and endothelial permeability [14]. This
limitation encouraged researchers to develop closed-loop recirculatory systems like MCARD, which allowed separation of the coronary vascular bed from the systemic. The principal strength of this
technology includes a dramatic (>100-fold) increase in transduction
efficiency, the extension of vector residence time, the ability to
manipulate endothelial permeability, the avoidance of an immune
response to the vector and the ability to washout the vector post
gene delivery limiting collateral organ exposure [15].
In this chapter, we describe molecular cardiac surgery with
recirculating vector delivery to the ovine heart in a large animal
model of post ischemic heart failure.

Procedure and Vector
Transfer

1. Personnel. Surgeon, assistant of surgeon, anesthesiologist, cardiovascular perfusionist (operates a heart–lung machine).
2. Blood. Since bleeding in cardiopulmonary bypass cases can
occasionally be rapid, unpredicted and life threatening, we will
draw 1 U of blood from 1 donor sheep routinely. If there are
significant bleeding concerns, we will draw 2–3 U. At the end
of bypass, we will evaluate a blood gas and if the hematocrit is
greater than 15 % then we will make a clinical judgment, based
on ongoing bleeding, arterial blood gases, electrolytes and
hemodynamic stability whether or not to transfuse each animal. If the hematocrit is less than 15 % then we will typically
transfuse the sheep. We use 3–4 sheep as blood donors for the
MCARD procedures. These donor sheep undergo no surgeries; their only involvement is as a blood donor for transfusions
for sheep undergoing MCARD. Blood draws will be performed
under sedation on the day of MCARD (two sheep undergo
draws for each MCARD, ~400 ml drawn for each sheep).
3. Drugs. Drugs and agents administered other than anesthesia
including analgesics, antibiotics, hypnotics, sedatives, and tranquilizing medications (Table 2).

Michael G. Katz et al.

4. Position the sheep in sternal recumbence on the preparation
table.
5. Intubation: Using a long straight-edge laryngoscope and
endotracheal suction (for clearance of secretions where necessary), visualize the vocal cords. Once vocal cords are in adequate view, insert the deflated, regular-cuffed 8Fr endotracheal
tube (or alternate size depending upon sheep’s laryngeal space
and vocal cord aperture), lubricated with viscous lidocaine,
into endotracheal passage between vocal cords. Inflate the balloon cuff with 20 ml of air. Confirm placement via auscultation
and connect endotracheal tube to the mechanical ventilation
apparatus with 2.5–3.5 % isoflurane. Depth of anesthesia is
monitored by vital signs, pupillary response to light, and
response to physical manipulation.
6. Insert the rumen tube, lubricated with lidocaine gel/KY jelly,
by feeding the tube gently, but firmly, over the base of the
tongue into the esophagus and down into the rumen tract.
Confirm placement via the presence of rumen fluid.
7. Administer 0.01 mg/kg buprenorphine IM, 0.02 mg/kg of
glycopyrrolate IM, 1 mg/kg banamine IM, and 2.2 mg/kg
naxcel IM.
8. Place fentanyl 100 μg patch onto the groin area and lubricate
eyes with Lacri-lube.
9. Clip the sheep and cleanse the surgical areas with chlorhexidine scrub followed by chlorhexidine solution.
10. Place EKG pads on clipped forelimbs and secure in place with
silk tape.
3.2 Infarct Creation
by Direct Ligation
of Coronary Arteries
(Fig. 1)

1. Connect the sheep to the anesthesia machine with 1.5–2.5 %
isoflurane.
2. Connect the ECG leads to the ECG machine and connect supportive IV lines.
3. Using the Seldinger technique, place a 7Fr triple lumen catheter in the left jugular vein, which can be used intraoperatively
for medication delivery and central venous pressure monitoring (see Note 2).
4. Place the animal in the supine position. Using sterile technique
with a 7Fr catheter, place a carotid or femoral arterial line for
invasive blood pressure monitoring and Millar catheter measurements. Following that, position the animal in a right lateral
decubitus position. Then prep and drape the left chest in sterile
fashion, using chlorhexidine scrub and solution.
5. One hour prior to creation of the infarct, we initiate I.V. amiodarone (75 mg/h), lidocaine (35 mg/h), and phenylephrine
(6–25 mg/h) to maintain systemic blood pressure >100 mmHg
(see Note 3).

Fig. 1 Infarct creation by direct ligation of coronary arteries. Coronary artery ligation. Left anterior thoracotomy is usually performed through the fifth intercostal
space. After opening the pericardium, the coronary anatomy is inspected. Obtuse
marginal 1 and obtuse marginal 2 arteries (main branches of the circumflex
artery) are ligated with Prolene 4-0 suture

6. Enter the chest via a 5–7 cm left mini-thoracotomy incision at
the IV–V intercostal space, reflect the left lung posteriorly, and
incise and reflect the pericardium superiorly and laterally. Next,
identify and ligate the proximal portion of the first two branches
of the obtuse marginal artery with 4-0 prolene sutures, with
close attention to EKG changes. Acute ST-elevation and surrounding tissue discoloration confirm the creation of an infarct.
7. Inspect places of coronary artery ligation for residual
hemorrhage.
8. Flash the pericardial space with Ringer-Lactate 3–5 times to
prevent future adhesions. Loosely approximate the pericardium with 3-0 silk.
9. Place a 28Fr thoracostomy angle tube and connect to low,
continuous wall suction via a Pleur-evac for 30 min. The thoracotomy incision is repaired in usual fashion. Discontinue the
thoracostomy tube and extubate in sequential fashion. Finally,
transport the animal to a recovery room for routine
postoperative care.
3.3 Molecular
Cardiac Surgery
with Recirculating
Delivery (MCARD)
(Fig. 2)

1. Preparing for cardiopulmonary bypass. Position the sheep in
supine position and secure all four limbs. Prep and drape the
sheep in sterile fashion from neck to knees after induction of
anesthesia. Place sterile large drapes and cut holes over chest,
right groin and right carotid artery (see Note 2).
2. Surgically expose the right femoral artery via cut-down procedure in standard fashion. Insert a 16 G angiocatheter into the
artery and connect to arterial line apparatus and monitor via

Fig. 2 Molecular cardiac surgery with recirculating delivery (MCARD). Cardiopulmonary-based closed-loop
recirculatory system (MCARD). The system includes two separate circuits that allows for complete cardiac
isolation and provides recirculation only in the coronary vasculature. Other advantages are increased time of
recirculation, possibility for washing out the vector, and retrograde transcoronary sinus gene delivery

pressure tubing. Another option is percutaneous cannulation
the right brachial artery or femoral artery for blood pressure
monitoring using arterial line kit. Once the arterial line is
placed and appropriate waveform and BP are confirmed, secure
the line using a 2-0 silk pop-off suture.
3. Shift to the right carotid artery. Expose the artery via cut-down
procedure as it was done with the right femoral artery in standard fashion in preparation for introduction of the carotid
catheterization to facilitate cardiopulmonary bypass. After
securing the delineated right carotid artery cover until bypass
configuration begins.

4. Advance the bone saw onto the field and proceed with creating
the median sternotomy, starting superiorly at the level of the
sternal notch and proceeding distally to at least two finger
breadths above the inferior aspect of the sternal plate, taking
care not to divide the xiphoid. Open the chest and use Arista
to control sternal bleeding.
5. Reflect the lung parenchyma and enter the pericardium, exposing the midline positioned cardiac window. Place pericardial
stay sutures.
6. Give Amicar, 5 g. Perform a transepicardial echocardiographic
examination to assess initial function of the heart (precardiopulmonary bypass period).
7. Make sure a small basin with the sheep’s own serum a 10 and
1 cm3 syringe and two 4-way stopcocks are on the field. Flush
each syringe and the stopcocks with the sheep’s own serum.
8. Place a pledgeted 4-0 Prolene purse string using a rosette of
pledgets around the right atrial appendage for superior vena
cava (SVC) cannulation. Doubly place two #0 silk heavy sutures
around the superior vena cava and connect to tourniquets.
Ensnare the ascending aorta using umbilical tapes. Place a purse
string on the right atrium adjacent to the atrioventricular
groove. This will become the cannulation site for the coronary
sinus catheter. Place one other purse string, also a rosette of
Teflon pledgets, on the right atrium near its junction with the
inferior vena cava (IVC) to accommodate IVC cannulation.
9. Give heparin (130 U/kg) and check active coagulation time
(ACT). Ensure ACT is greater than 400 before proceeding.
Bring the systemic lines onto the surgical field. Cannulate the
right carotid artery using a 14Fr cannula.
10. Using pericardial pledgets and 4-0 Prolene suture, a horizontal
mattress, place a pledgeted suture on the ascending aorta,
approximately 1 cm distal to the aortic root. Place the aortic
cannula, which is a DLP cardioplegic cannula (containing a
vent limb). Cannulate the superior vena cava using a 26 French
right angle cannula. Place the retrograde catheter into the coronary sinus. Connect the SVC cannula to a Y connector (with
one limb clamped) and connect to the venous limb of the
pump circuit. Bring the in-flow lines from the coronary reservoir circuit and out-flow lines up to the table. Recirculate the
coronary reservoir solution through a stopcock with care to
avoid entry of the solution into the systemic circulation or
onto the field. Ligate the right azygous (hemiazygous) veins
with a 2-0 silk suture making sure there are no other veins
draining into the SVC (see Note 4).
11. Partial cardiopulmonary bypass is initiated. Cannulate the inferior vena cava using a 26Fr right angle cannula.

282

Michael G. Katz et al.

12. Full cardiopulmonary bypass is initiated. Dissect out the heart
further as needed. Cool the heart to 30° with bypass heat
exchanger. Doubly snare the IVC with a double loop of 0 silk
suture. Using pericardial pledgets and a 4-0 Prolene suture,
place a horizontal mattress pledgeted suture on the ascending
aorta approximately 1 cm distal to the aortic root. Place the
aortic cannula, which is a DLP cardioplegic cannula (containing a vent limb). Place a stopcock onto the DLP aortic root
cannula. Connect the parallel arm of the stopcock to one limb
of the Y connector of the cardioplegia line. The other limb will
be connected to the coronary sinus catheter. Clamp the cardiac
inflow limb (will later connect to the retrograde catheter).
Connect the inflow to the Quest system (cardioplegia/cardiac
circuit inflow) and de-air. Connect the right arm of the 1/4,
1/4, 1/4 Y connector to the aortic root vent (DLP aortic root
vent arm). Connect the root of the Y connector to the yellow
vent. Clamp the left arm of the Y connector.
13. The heart begins to fibrillate. Reduce aortic flow.
14. Cross clamp the aorta. Give 15 cm3/kg Del Nido cardioplegia
via the aortic root cannula in antegrade fashion.
15. Dissect out and ligate the left azygous vein (see Note 5). Then
place a purse string 4-0 Prolene suture in the apex of the left
ventricle. Volume is left in the heart. Make a stab in the middle
of the purse string, and place a cannula into the left ventricular
cavity and clamp. Place a pledgeted purse string 4-0 Prolene
suture in the right ventricular out-flow tract. Then palace a cannula into the right ventricle, clamp and snare the purse string.
16. The cardiac circuit is constructed. The aortic DLP vent remains
clamped. Connect the LV and RV vents and aortic root vents
via a “Y” connecter to the venous limb of the cardiac circuit.
The other limb of the Quest system inflow Y connector is left
clamped. This will later be connected to the coronary sinus
catheter. Connect the aortic root vent limb of the cardiac circuit to the left arm of the 1/4, 1/4, 1/4 Y connector. Connect
the outflow limb of the cardiac circuit to the cardiac venous
return. Put a clamp on the outflow limb of the cardiac circuit
(directing all vents to the yellow vent for decompression).
Connect the arterial limb of the cardiac circuit to the coronary
sinus catheter (see Note 6).
17. Give a second dose of cardioplegia with Plegisol 15 cm3/kg via
the aortic root cannula in antegrade fashion.
18. Isolate the coronary circuit by tightening the superior vena caval
snares, tightening the inferior vena caval snares (make sure
these snares are tight. This is the largest source of dilution of
the cardiac circuit), and cross clamping the pulmonary artery.
Infuse the coronary sinus catheter with only 3 cm3 to avoid

Cardiac Surgery Delivery of Vectors

283

rupture of the coronary sinus. Connect the cardiac inflow limb
to the retrograde catheter. Unclamp the cardiac circuit inflow
limb and clamp the cardioplegia limb. Remove all excess volume and air from the circuit by decompressing using the yellow vent and infusing this volume systemically into the pump
once the heart is decompressed. Resume flow until coronary
sinus driving pressure equals 100–110 mmHg. Inject solution
of Methylene blue (1 ml in 10 ml Saline) into the coronary
sinus to confirm good cardiac isolation. Clamp the yellow vent
and remove the clamp from the cardiac outflow limb directing
all cardiac venous return to the cardiac circuit not to the yellow
vent. Sinus pressure usually must be kept less than 80 mmHg
with driving pressure of 100–110 mmHg.
19. Inject the Nitroglycerine diluted in 10 cm3 Normal saline.
Wait 2 min. Then inject the vector solution rapidly to simulate
the measured flow rate. Restore flow over 1 min until coronary
sinus pressure equals 90–100 mmHg and recirculate the
remaining reservoir solution for another 15 min. Periodically
decompress the heart into the pop off reservoir at 10 cm3 per
minute. This volume will be discarded.
20. Once the 15 min recirculation interval is done, unclamp the
yellow vent and place the clamp on the cardiac outflow limb
directing all cardiac venous return to the yellow vent.
Decompress the heart and tell the perfusionist that the yellow
vent is “waste”. Inject Methylene blue again to confirm isolation. Remove the coronary sinus catheter. Unclamp the cardioplegia limb and clamp the cardiac circuit limb of the Quest
system inflow. Clamp the aortic root vent of the DLP cannula
to avoid the flush bypassing the heart.
21. The coronary circuit is flushed antegrade with approximately
1000 cm3 of Hespan infused with 100 mg of Solu-Medrol, 50 mg
of Benadryl and 300 mg of cimetidine. Note that the aortic root
vent must be clamped and the RV and LV effluent must be discarded (since it has viral solution in it). Decompress the heart
again (into the yellow vent) and discard excess volume.
22. After flow has been reduced, the remove the aortic and pulmonary cross clamps and restore flow. Convert the yellow vent to
the systemic vent.
23. Initiate Rewarming. Remove the IVC and SVC snares. Remove
the aortic root DLP cannula. Defibrillate the heart to restore
normal sinus rhythm. The IVC and SVC cannulae is removed.
Remove the RV cannula. The LV cannula may now be converted to systemic vents. Administer Epinephrine at 10–20 ml/
min (1–2 μg/min). Administer a 50 mg Lidocaine bolus and
an infusion at 1 mg/min. Give 5 mg Amicar. Once the heart is
contracting well, the LV cannula is removed.

284

Michael G. Katz et al.

24. Wean from bypass after 20 min of reperfusion. Once off bypass,
give protamine and check ACT. Blood samples during CPB are
obtained at various intervals approximately once every
30–45 min to assess for the animal’s serum electrolyte levels,
ACT, pH, pCO2, and pO2 levels (see Note 7).
25. After the sheep has been weaned from bypass, obtain another
trans-epicardial echocardiogram to grossly determine heart
function after bypass. Place bilateral chest tubes to get rid of
pneumothorax, and remove these 24–48 h postoperatively.
The thoracostomy tubes should subsequently be connected to
wall suction through a multiliter Pleur-evac.
26. Give cell saver intravenously to the sheep. Place topical hemostatic agents on the heart, sternum, and/or incision to aid in
stoppage of any bleeding from any of these sites. Close the
sternal incision with seven to eight 2-0 steel wires in standard
fashion.
27. Repair subcutaneous and skin layers with 1 Vicryl and 2-0
Nylon suture, respectively. Remove the femoral arterial line
and repair the artery, primarily using 7-0 Prolene.
28. Prior to closure of the right neck incision, place a central
venous catheter in the jugular vein to allow for CVP monitoring postoperatively. This catheter will be used for the administration of IV fluids and IV antibiotics.
29. When extubating the animal, care is taken to observe jaw
motion, eye movement, and axial motion. Position the animal
in sternal recumbency to prevent aspiration and to encourage
recovery. Transfer the sheep to the postoperative care area
once the animal has been taken off the ventilator.
3.4 Postoperative
Care

1. Survival in large animal surgery with CPB depends highly on
the quality of immediate critical care. Yet only a small body of
literature is devoted to large animal ICU management, tissue
perfusion, blood transfusion, or inflammatory response,
especially after surgery with CPB. The primary component of
acute postoperative care is the maintenance of adequate oxygen
delivery to tissues. Appropriate monitoring provides valuable
information on the animal’s viability. We have created a postoperative protocol (Table 3). A key aspect of this protocol is
the constant supervision of the animal for the first 24–36 h
after surgery.
2. After the animal recovers from anesthesia, extubate while in
sternal recumbency. Ability to maintain the animal in sternal
recumbency until standing has been critical to recovery.
3. Affix a nasal cannula to the animal’s rostrum with biological
glue and connect the cannula to humidified oxygen. Initiate
oxygen supplementation at 5 l/min until the sheep is active
and able to maintain a pulse oximetry value of 94 % or greater.

4. Monitor the animal’s physiologic parameters, beginning with
measurement of its temperature, pulse, respirations (TPR),
heart rate, SpO2, etc.—obtained every 2–4 h and documented
in the animal record.
5. Monitor central venous pressure (CVP) via triple lumen catheter
in the jugular vein with a CVP manometer, which may remain in
place and functional for up to 3 days without infection if properly flushed with heparin. CVP monitoring (target: 4–10 mm
H2O) provides important information regarding blood volume
which may allow for life saving interventions with Lasix or fluids.
We have found that CVP catheters provide the best balance of
safety and monitoring compared to a Swan-Ganz catheter which
presents a danger if left in an active animal.
6. Obtain an arterial blood gas sample via the auricular artery of
either ear if possible every 2–4 h for the first 12 h to evaluate
acid-base level and electrolytes—especially potassium, calcium
and magnesium. Correct metabolic acidosis or alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia with IV supplementation. In the absence of arterial access, venous samples
from the jugular CVP catheter are used instead.

286

Michael G. Katz et al.

7. Rewarm the animal with warming blanket to prevent hypothermia (>100 F).
8. Our first antibiotic regime includes procaine penicillin G
22,000 IU/kg IV and gentamicin 6.6 mg/kg IV, given 1 h
prior to incision. Postoperatively, provide procaine penicillin G
every 6 h and gentamicin every 24 h for 4–5 days. If a second
line treatment is required, we use ceftiofur sodium 2.2 mg/kg
IM and enrofloxacin 5 mg/kg IM daily for 5 days.
9. In the early postoperative period, we administer a fluid mixture
composed of half crystalloid Normosol-R and half colloidal
hydroxyethyl starch at a rate of up to 100 ml/h depending on CVP.
10. Perform laboratory analyses of WBC count, electrolytes, liver
and kidney function daily for 3 days after surgery and whenever animals appear weak.
11. Assessment of pain in the postoperative period is very important. For pain care buprenorphine and a fentanyl patch will be
used for the first 3 days with the dose adjusted based on the
animal’s activity and vitals. Give the first dose of each after
induction of anesthesia. Place the fentanyl patch of 100 μg/h
following clipping. At this time 2–5 μg/kg buprenorphine will
be given IV. The following signs will be used for pain distress:
poor oral intake, increased heart rate/tachypnea, reluctance to
move, pawing at the surgical site and inability to stand in the
recumbent position and hyperesthesia.
12. Observe and record urine and excrement production and chest
thoracostomy tube output. If postoperative blood loss from
the chest thoracostomy tubes is greater than 100 cm3/h, activated coagulation time, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels are
checked immediately. One must then consider a surgical source
of bleeding or coagulopathy.
13. Remove the thoracostomy tubes 24–36 h postoperatively. The
proper use of thoracostomy tubes helps reduce the incidence of
pleural effusions. However, delayed pleural effusions may still
occur, requiring insertion of new thoracostomy tubes for 24 h.
14. Observe each sheep daily for evidence of surgical site infection,
pain, and cardiovascular or respiratory compromise. This
observation includes a physical exam, observation of the surgical site, assessment of attitude, activity, appetite, and fecal production, measurement of temperature, pulse rate, respiratory
rate, thoracic auscultation, and oxygen saturation via pulse
oximetry. When necessary, perform blood pressure measurements, electrocardiography, or echocardiography.
15. Begin nourishment with water when the sheep is alert, and hay
may be given when the animal is standing, but neither is offered
prior to 6 h postoperatively.

Notes
1. Consistent coronary arterial anatomy in sheep, similar to that
of humans, and a lack of collateral vessels provides substantial
advantages for creation of a clinically relevant ischemic heart
failure model with a predictable myocardial infarct size in this
species. The coronary venous systems are also similar between
sheep and humans, with the exception of the left azygous vein,
which drains the dorsal part of the left chest. This physiologically appropriate large-animal model, involving ligation of the
circumflex artery’s first two branches is accompanied by almost
zero mortality and is highly suitable for demonstrating ventricular remodeling after gene therapy.
2. The anesthesiologist should closely monitor the animal’s cardiovascular stability during the surgical procedure to avoid systemic vasodilatation with afterload reduction or arrhythmias,
and to attempt to preserve sinus rhythm. Intraoperative monitoring of all essential physiologic parameters is imperative for a
successful outcome. These measuring devices include both
invasive and noninvasive parameters: pulse oximetry, invasive
blood pressure, echocardiography, temperature, and ECG.
3. A variety of drugs are available to prevent ventricular arrhythmias
in a myocardial infarction model. From our point of view the best
protocol includes receiving IV the two antiarrhythmic drugs amiodarone and lidocaine 1 h before ligation of coronary arteries,
with this treatment continued 60–120 min afterward. In cases of
low blood pressure we add phenylephrine to this combination.
4. During the MCARD procedure attention should be devoted
to the aortic root purse string because sheep have a very short
ascending aorta. For the same reason, care must be taken to
observe adequate space for placement of the aortic crossclamp. In the sheep model, the descending aorta begins with
an acute angle only after a few centimeters of the ascending
aorta. Care not taken in this placement will result in concomitant cross-clamp of both the ascending and descending aorta.
5. Ligation of the left hemizygous vein confirms complete cardiac
isolation and prevents systemic loss of viral particles.
6. A standard adult retrograde cannula is used for the cannulation
of the coronary sinus for vector delivery. Care must be taken to
inspect and confirm that the catheter in positioned properly in
the coronary sinus. The best results have been received when
the catheter tip was placed in a midway position after the deviation of the posterior descending vein. Placement is confirmed
with injection of methylene blue and evaluated by its distribution throughout the major cardiac veins in the right and left
ventricles.

288

7. Prior to stopping CPB, the animal is rewarmed to 36–37 °C,
the heart is defibrillated and the lungs are ventilated ensuring
that intraoperative atelectasis has resolved. Cardiac rhythm is
monitored; acid–base status and plasma electrolytes are
reviewed. Inotropic drugs are started at low flow rates. After
weaning, cardiac filling and contractility is monitored by echocardiography. When cardiac performance is stable, cardiac inotropic support is ceased. Protamine can be administered in half
or full doses until ACT is appropriate.

Gene Delivery for the Generation of Bioartificial Pacemaker
Patrick K.W. Chan and Ronald A. Li
Abstract
Electronic pacemakers have been used in patients with heart rhythm disorders for device-supported pacing.
While effective, there are such shortcomings as limited battery life, permanent implantation of catheters,
the lack of autonomic neurohumoral responses, and risks of lead dislodging. Here we describe protocols
for establishing porcine models of sick sinus syndrome and complete heart block, and the generation of
bioartificial pacemaker by delivering a strategically engineered form of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic
nucleotide-gated pacemaker channel protein via somatic gene transfer to convert atrial or ventricular muscle cardiomyocytes into nodal-like cells that rhythmically fire action potentials.
Key words Bioartificial pacemaker, Heart rhythms, Sick sinus syndrome, Complete heart block, Gene
transfer, Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel, Adenovirus, Adenoassociated virus

Introduction
Normal cardiac rhythms originate in the sino-atrial node (SAN), a
specialized cardiac tissue consisting of only a few thousands nodal
pacemaker (Pm) cardiomyocytes (CMs) that resides within the
right atrium [1, 2]. The SAN initiates and controls heart rate by
spontaneously generating rhythmic action potentials (APs) that
propagate through the atria to the atrioventricular (AV) node and
subsequently to the ventricles for coordinated chamber contractions and blood pumping. Diseases and aging may lead to malfunction of PmCMs which results in rhythm generation disorders (e.g.,
bradycardias, sick sinus syndrome (SSS)), necessitating the implantation of electronic pacemaker, with shortcomings such as limited
battery life, permanent implantation of catheters, the lack of autonomic neurohumoral responses, risks of lead dislodging (particularly to pediatric patients due to somatic growth) [3–7], etc. As
such, the engineering of bioartificial pacemaker or bio-SAN as an
alternative or supplement to electronic devices has been pursued.

The process of pacemaking involves the complex interplay of
an array of ionic channels and pumps. Among the key players, the
hyperpolarization-activated If (f for funny) or the so-called pacemaker current [8] is robustly expressed in PmCMs but absent in
healthy adult ventricular (V) CMs. This depolarization current If is
encoded by the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated
(HCN) channel gene family [9–13]. Despite the structural similarity with the classical depolarization-activated voltage-gated K+ (Kv)
channels whose fundamental building blocks are monomers consisting of six transmembrane domains (S1–S6), HCN channels are
activated by hyperpolarization rather than depolarization, and they
permeate Na+ and K+ nonselectively. To date, four isoforms
(HCN1–4) have been identified, with HCN1 being most abundantly expressed in the brain and substantially in the SAN [14, 15].
Unlike HCN2 and HCN4 that are found in both the central nervous system and the heart, HCN3 is absent in the heart. Of note,
native If is heteromeric made up of multiple HCN isoforms in different stoichiometries, making their reproduction in any heterologous or other systems extremely difficult because of such complex
molecular identity. In response to neural inputs, If generated by
HCN channels modulates heart rate by regulating the rates of cellular depolarization to AP threshold and thereby the firing frequency. Indeed, mutations in the human HCN gene have been
reported to underlie certain forms of familial sinus node dysfunction [16, 17]. In our earlier structure–function studies of HCN
constructs, we discovered that their opening and closing are highly
dependent on the length of the linker between the S3 and S4 transmembrane segments and several charged amino acid therein [18–
20]. In general, long and short linkers shift the steady-state
activation of HCN channels in the negative and positive directions,
making them energetically more difficult and easier to open,
respectively. In particular, a recombinant, hHCN1ΔΔΔ, whose
S3–S4 linker residues 246–248 (EVY) have been deleted, displays
biophysical properties similar to the native heteromeric If current.
Such findings led to the possibility of engineering HCN activity for
programming bioartificial pacing [21].
Unlike pacemaker cells, adult atrial and ventricular CMs are
normally electrically quiescent unless they are stimulated by electric signals transmitted from neighboring cells that originate from
the SAN. This is largely due to the absence or scarce expression of
the HCN-encoded If and the intense expression of the Kir2encoded inward-rectifier K+ current (IK1), which stabilize a negative resting membrane potential at ~−80 mV. Indeed, suppression
of IK1 expression in normally silent ventricular muscle cells by 80 %
can induce spontaneous action potential firing in a binary “onand-off” manner. However, the induced frequency is only onethird of the normal physiological range and therefore practically
not suitable for acting as a reliable biological pacemaker [22].

Alternatively, recombinant HCN channels have been employed for
the induction of automaticity [21, 23–26]. By expressing exogenous modified HCN1 (whose S3–S4 linker has been shortened to
favor channel opening) in the VCMs from adult guinea pig left
ventricle via adenovirus (AdV), transduced myocytes displays physiological pacemaking activities that resemble those of native nodal
cells, which cannot be observed in VCMs transduced with AdV
carrying wild-type HCN or HCN with a lengthened S3–S4 linker
[21]. Such induced bioartificial pacing can be inhibited by HCNspecific blocker ZD7288. Interestingly, the ZD7288-silenced cells
generate typical ventricular AP phenotype upon electrical stimulation, implying that the HCN-converted pacemaker cells retain
their ventricular identity when not functioning an as a bio-SAN—a
dual identity that is not seen in native nodal cells.
To test whether HCN-mediated bio-SAN can mimic the native
pacemaker, a swine model of SSS has been developed such that
clinically relevant procedures and assessments can be performed
[26]. Importantly, the anatomical and physiological properties of
swine heart are more comparable to those of human, when compared to small animals (e.g., >500 bpm of rodent hearts versus
~70–80 bpm of pig and human hearts). Porcine SSS model can be
created by firstly ablating the native SAN using radiofrequency, followed by the implantation of a dual-chamber electronic pacemaker
for device-supported cardiac pacing. Focal injection of the recombinant adenovirus AdV-CMV-GFP-IRES-HCN1ΔΔΔ in the left
atrium of the SSS swine reproducibly induces a stable in vivo bioSAN that fires at physiological heart rate, successfully reducing the
dependence of electronic pacing (from 80 to 15 %) over a period of
2 weeks. As an alternative, Hu et al. [27] demonstrated a somatic
reprogramming of VCMs to pacemaker-like CMs via an ectopic
expression of embryonic transcription factor T-box 18 (Tbx18) in
a swine model with ablated AV node (complete heart block).
Tbx18 is required for the formation of the sinus node head during
embryonic SAN specialization. AdV-mediated overexpression of
Tbx18 confers electrically quiescent CMs temporary pacemaker
activity [28]. The bioartificial pacemaker created also responds to
β-adrenergic stimulation and shows minimal reliance on the backup
electronic device [27].
Although high titers of viral particles with high in vivo transduction efficiencies can be readily produced, AdV only mediates
transient transgene expression without genome integration. Indeed,
transgene expression has been shown to peak at ~1 week, plateaus,
then decline over a period of ~3–5 weeks after transduction in previous gene-transfer studies. No transgene expression could be
detected by week 10 [29–31]. Furthermore, the intense immune
response evoked by AdV also significantly hampers its use for investigating long-term efficacy and safety. As such, the replicationdeficient and nonpathogenic recombinant adeno-associated virus

296

Patrick K.W. Chan and Ronald A. Li

(rAAV) has been employed. Like AdV, rAAV can also be generated
at high titers for mediating persistent genetic modification.
Moreover, rAAV elicits minimal humoral and cellular immune
responses in human [32]. Indeed, rAAV-mediated gene transfer has
been shown to be highly efficient in the heart as reported previously
[33–38].
Building upon our series of previous studies, here we summarize a method to functionally reprogram CMs into PmCMs via
AdV- and rAAV serotype 9 (rAAV9, an isoform chosen for cardiac
tropism)-mediated overexpression of the engineered human
hHCN1ΔΔΔ. The system has been tested in preclinical large animal porcine models of SSS and complete heart block.

Notes
1. A bicistronic AdV shuttle vector pAd-CMV-GFP-IRES carrying the recombinant hHCN1ΔΔΔ gene with shortened S3–S4
linker is used for AdV production. The internal ribosomal
entry site (IRES) allows the simultaneous translation of GFP
and hHCN1ΔΔΔ [21].
2. Adenovirus Ψ5, with packaging signal Ψ flanked by loxP sites,
serves as a helper virus for replicating and packaging the gutless
virus (AdV-GFP-IRES-hHCN1∆∆∆) that keeps only 5′ and 3′
inverted terminal repeats and the packaging signal from the
wild-type AdV. When the shuttle vector and the helper adeovirus are co-transfected into the Cre recombinase-expression
cells, the packaging site of the adenovirus Ψ5 is excised while
other viral proteins for AdV generation are retained. As such,

Gene-Based Bioartificial Pacemaker

303

the AdV-GFP-IRES-hHCN1∆∆∆ is preferentially packaged
and can be further amplified and purified by repeated infection
in Cre recombinase-expression cells.
3. pTR-hHCN1∆∆∆-T2A-EGFP is created by cloning
recombinant hHCN1ΔΔΔ and EGFP into the pTRUF backbone. The T2A linker peptide allows simultaneous expression
of the two genes. SURE 2 Supercompetent bacterial cells
(Strategene/Agilent Cat. # 200152) have to be used for cloning and re-transformation of AAV pTR plasmids. Transformed
SURE 2 Supercompetent bacterial cells should be cultured at
30 °C. Restriction enzyme SmaI can be used to ensure the
retainment of the inverted terminal repeat region of the AAV:
two bands of size 4.1 and 3.1 kb (instead of one 7 kb-band)
can be obtained upon electrophoresis.
4. pDG9 is generated by replacing the capsid gene in pDG, the
helper plasmid for packaging AAV serotype 2. The resulting
replication-deficient rAAV serotype 9 is cardiotropic and is recommended for creating bioartificial pacemaker.
5. Formation of iodixanol gradient is a critical step for rAAV purification. To prevent mixing of the layers during the preparation, a peristaltic pump with controlled flow rate can be used:
viral solution is firstly added to the ultracentrifuge tube, followed by sequential underlaying of iodixanol layers through a
glass pipette (starting with the 15 % iodixanol layer).
6. After ultracentrifugation, rAAV is distributed through the 40 %
iodixanol layer. Clamp the centrifuge tube firmly to a stand to
allow the insertion of 18 G syringe needle at about 1 cm below
the 25–40 % interphase. Pull the syringe to recover about 4 mL
of viral solution. Avoid drawing any solution that contains
phenol red.
7. Dialysis allows removal of unwanted materials in the rAAV solution. Replacing the lactated Ringer’s Injection solution and
allowing dialysis for another 8–10 h is recommended, especially
if any colored layer is collected after ultracentrifugation.
8. Virus can be verified by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie blue staining. Signature bands of VP1, VP2, and VP3 could be observed
at 87 kDa, 73 kDa, and 62 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2).
9. Quantification of virus can be done by qPCR using sequences
within the CMV-ie enhancer region as primers.
10. Concentrated virus is injected using a steerable catheter
equipped with a 33 gauge circular injection needle that can be
advanced and retracted, at 4 sites within 3 mm of each other.
Given the proximity and spread, one macrosite is formed.
Multiple injections (~5–6) of smaller volumes to form a single

Gene Therapy for Post-infarction Ventricular Tachycardia
J. Kevin Donahue
Abstract
Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. In particular,
cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death in these countries. Death generally
results from a ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and pathology data have shown that cardiac arrest victims very
frequently have evidence of coronary atherosclerosis with either acute ischemia or healed myocardial
infarction. In this work, we describe an animal model that reproducibly has inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias after healing of a myocardial infarction scar and a gene delivery method that allows gene transfer
to the scar and surrounding myocardial tissues. Use of the method allows gene delivery to the arrhythmia
model for testing of hypotheses related to ventricular tachyarrhythmia mechanisms and for efficacy testing
of proposed gene therapies. To date, all work in this area has been preclinical, but it is our hope that continued development in this area will 1 day allow translation of this method into clinical practice.

Introduction
Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) are the leading cause of death in
the developed world [1]. Currently available therapies have limited
efficacy and measurable toxicity. Antiarrhythmic drugs are able to
suppress VT. Other than β-adrenergic blocking drugs, all currently
available antiarrhythmic drugs have adverse or at best neutral
effects on mortality [2–8]. Even a neutral effect is a marker of toxicity because the positive effect of arrhythmia suppression must be
balanced by other negative effects to give the overall neutral result.
VT ablation can eliminate arrhythmia circuits, but recurrences are
common and VT ablation procedures are long, complex, and, in a
small percentage of cases, complicated by adverse events [9]. The
current mainstay of VT therapy is the implantable cardioverter
defibrillator (ICD). ICDs have been repeatedly shown to save lives
[7, 10, 11], but they do not prevent VT. They terminate already
occurring VT with pacing or a shock. ICD therapies have been
associated with increased mortality [12]. The limitations of

currently available therapies motivate the search for new preventative or treatment options. Gene therapy has been reported in preclinical models to reduce or eliminate VT [13–15].
In this report, we describe methods for creation of a preclinical
model to test post-infarct VT therapies and for delivery of genes to
the infarct borderzone to modify the susceptible tissues and impair
their ability to generate or sustain VT. The preclinical model is
described for pigs because that is the species in which it was developed and validated [13, 16]. Other infarct-VT models have been
reported in sheep, dogs, rabbits, rats and mice. We use the pig
model because our interest is in arrhythmias occurring in the
chronic state after the infarct scar is completely healed. Pig coronary anatomy, cardiac structure and function, and electrophysiology are similar to human. Important differences include transmural
Purkinje fibers in the pig (these extend only through the endocardium in humans) and differences in an early repolarizing current
(pigs only have Ito2 but humans have Ito1 and Ito2). We have found
smaller mammals difficult to use for translational studies, so we
have focused on large mammalian work. In addition, rodent studies have limited value because rodent electrophysiological function
is considerably different than that of larger mammals. The dog
model has been used primarily in the subacute period when the
scar is healing because VT inducibility is significantly reduced after
the infarct scar matures [17–19]. Sheep are expensive. With the
limitations of these other species, we settled on pigs, and we
describe those methods here.
Since our infarct model is porcine, it stands to reason that our
gene transfer methods are also developed and validated in the pig
[20]. The two principle gene delivery methods for large mammals
are direct intramyocardial injection and coronary vascular perfusion. Injection results in dense, local gene transfer, and perfusion
allows broader but less efficient gene delivery. We have not yet
found a solution for the limited volume of delivery for injection,
and we have identified several interventions that increase efficiency
of delivery by perfusion, so we have used the perfusion method for
our preclinical studies. Details of the major conceptual elements of
our perfusion method are described in Sasano et al. [16]. These
include use of vasodilators to maximize delivery to the local capillary level; vascular permeability inducers to increase probability of
gene transfer vector transit from the vasculature into the extracellular space, and simultaneous arterial and venous perfusion to provide further driving force for exit from the vasculature. In addition,
we optimize virus concentration and delivery time as much as possible, and we make every attempt to avoid exposure of the viral
vector to anything that might inhibit gene delivery. This strategy
resulted from a series of investigations that identified the various
relevant components of the delivery system [20–23].

4. Intubate, ventilate, and anesthetize with isoflurane 1.75 %
(see Note 6).
5. Clean the skin if needed, shave to remove hair from surgical
areas and from ECG and defibrillator patch sites.
6. Insert an intravenous catheter (ear veins are the most accessible in pigs) and maintain vein patency with a slow infusion of
0.9 % saline.
7. Apply electrodes for 12-lead ECG to conventional positions,
and apply external defibrillator patches in anterior-right sternal
and posterior apical positions.
8. Sterilize the skin by scrubbing with a chlorhexidine sponge for
5 min followed by a Betadine sponge for 5 min and then spray
the surgical field with Betadine solution.
9. Drape the edges of the surgical field with towels and a surgical
sheet, and secure these in place with towel clips.
10. In the right neck, cut down and isolate the carotid artery and
jugular vein. In the pig, the external jugular is larger so it more
easily accommodates catheters, sheaths and leads.
11. Insert a 7 Fr. sheath into the jugular vein for IV access (later
this site will be used to implant the ICD lead); insert an 8 Fr
sheath into the carotid artery (for blood pressure monitoring
and coronary catheterization) (see Note 7).
12. Administer heparin (see Note 5): for pigs, the dose is a
10,000 U initial IV bolus and then 5000 U bolus each hour
while catheters are in the artery.
13. Continuously monitor temperature, ECG, BP, ETCO2, and
SaO2 monitoring (see Note 8).
14. Access the left coronary system by placing a JL 3.5 or JL4shaped coronary catheter into the left main coronary artery;
cather placement should be performed over an 0.035″ guidewire (see Note 7).
15. Image the left coronary system by infusion of nonionic radiographic contrast medium during fluoroscopic recording.
16. Subselect the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD)
using a 0.014″ guidewire placed through the coronary
catheter.
17. Catheterize the LAD by insertion of an angioplasty catheter
over the 0.014″ wire; generally a balloon size of
3–4 mm × 10 mm is sufficient. For this application, either
monorail or over-the-wire catheter is acceptable. Place the
catheter so that the entire balloon (visible by radiographic
markers) is distal to the second diagonal branch of the LAD
(Fig. 1).

18. After confirming angioplasty catheter location by repeat infusion of contrast agent through the coronary guide catheter,
occlude the LAD by expanding the angioplasty balloon to 3
ATM pressure. After the balloon is inflated, dislodge the coronary guide catheter from left main coronary (see Note 9).
19. Secure all catheters to the body (see Note 10).
20. Immediately defibrillate/cardiovert any sustained ventricular
arrhythmias. Less than 5 s should lapse between onset of the
arrhythmia and defibrillation (see Note 2).
21. If needed, maintain blood pressure with IV saline, dopamine
(5–20 μg/kg/min), or phenylephrine (50–200 μg bolus) (see
Note 11). In pigs, we keep the systolic blood pressure greater
than 50 mmHg during infarction.
22. If frequent ventricular ectopy (>10 single premature ventricular beats/min or any non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) or
any sustained ventricular arrhythmia occurs, administer amiodarone 150 mg in 10 ml saline IV over 10 min (see Note 12).
23. If hemodynamically significant bradycardia occurs (heart
rate < 60 beats per minute with hypotension), administer atropine 0.05 mg/kg IV (see Note 13).

VT Gene Therapy Methods

24. If hypotension is intractable, consider repositioning the balloon to a slightly more distal position in the artery. This issue
is generally apparent within 5 min of occlusion and is notable
by continual progressive drop in blood pressure. Due to issues
of ischemic preconditioning, it is best to use experience as a
guide for correct initial balloon positioning and avoid repeated
deflation/inflation of the balloon.
25. In the last 30 min of the infarction procedure, if the animal is
stable, remove the jugular sheath and use that access to place
a defibrillator lead in the right ventricular apex. Attach the
defibrillator lead to an ICD, and place the ICD in a subcutaneous pocket in the right neck. Administer cefazolin 1 g IV
during ICD implantation and flush the defibrillator pocket
with antibiotic solution after ICD implantation for infection
prophylaxis.
26. After 150 min, deflate the angioplasty balloon. Confirm that
the balloon is fully deflated and then remove all coronary catheters from the sheath.
27. Titrate off pressors. Remove the arterial sheath when stable.
Close the neck incision with a 2-0 vicryl running subcutaneous suture and a 3-0 vicryl running skin suture. Dress the
wound. Taper off anesthesia. Extubate when the animal is
awake enough to protect airway. Monitor the animal until it
has recovered enough to be returned to the holding pen.
28. If the defibrillator can be programmed to allow heart rates up
to 300 bpm (in pigs), program the shock function on.
Otherwise, keep the defibrillator off and use only for weekly
assessment of arrhythmia inducibility.

Assessment

Inducibility

1. Maintain the animal in NPO status overnight.
2. Sedate with IM injection of telazol, ketamine, and xylazine,
2.2 mg/kg of each. This dose is generally enough to make the
animal unresponsive. Administer supplemental doses of sedation if needed to achieve an appropriate level of consciousness.
3. Clean the skin if needed; shave to remove hair from the ECG
and defibrillator patch sites, apply ECG and defibrillation patches.
4. Interrogate the defibrillator using the company-specific
programmer.
5. Perform programmed ventricular stimulation through the
defibrillator as follows:
(a) Test basic drive trains of 350, 300 and 250 ms. Use 8
beats per drive.
(b) Sequentially add premature beats and test to refractoriness
or a minimum coupling interval of 140 ms. For each
drive train cycle length, test single, double, and triple
extrastimuli.

314

(c) For any induced arrhythmias, obtain a brief 12 lead ECG
recording prior to arrhythmia termination.
(d) Burst pace from the ICD to terminate any monomorphic
VT. If that fails, cardiovert from the ICD, or if necessary,
from the external defibrillator.
(e) Immediately defibrillate any polymorphic VT or VF using
the ICD, and if necessary, the external defibrillator.
6. Monitor the animal until awake and return to the holding pen.
3.3

Gene Transfer

1. Sterilize all surgical equipment.
2. Maintain the animal in NPO status overnight.
3. Administer tadalafil 10 mg PO on the morning of the procedure. This can generally be done by pulverizing the pill and
mixing it with a minimal amount of carrier (applesauce, wet
pig chow, etc.).
4. Sedate the animal by intramuscular (IM) injection of a telazol,
ketamine, and xylazine mixture, 2.2 mg/kg of each component
(see Note 14).
5. Intubate, ventilate and anesthetize with isoflurane 1.75 %
(see Note 6).
6. Clean the skin if needed, shave to remove hair from surgical
areas and from ECG and defibrillator patch sites.
7. Insert an intravenous catheter and maintain vein patency with
a slow infusion of 0.9 % saline.
8. Apply electrodes for 12-lead ECG to conventional positions,
and apply external defibrillator patches in anterior-right sternal
and posterior apical positions.
9. Sterilize the skin by scrubbing with a chlorhexidine sponge for
5 min followed by a Betadine sponge for 5 min and then spray
the surgical field with Betadine solution.
10. Drape the edges of the surgical field with towels and a surgical
sheet, and secure these in place with towel clips.
11. In the right neck, cut down and isolate the carotid artery and
internal jugular vein. Insert a 7 Fr sheath into the vein and an
8 Fr sheath into the artery. If the artery was ligated rather than
repaired at the time of infarction, extract clot from the vessel
to achieve patency.
12. Advance a multipurpose coronary catheter through the jugular venous sheath into the coronary sinus (see Note 15).
(a) Place an 0.014″ wire through the multipurpose catheter
into the great cardiac vein.
(b) Advance an over-the-wire angioplasty catheter into the
proximal great cardiac vein (Fig. 2).

13. Advance a Judkins left 3.5–4 guide catheter into the left main
coronary artery.
(a) Infuse nonionic radiographic contrast medium into the
left main to visualize the left coronary anatomy. Mark the
approximate location of the prior balloon placement from
the MI procedure.
(b) Place an 0.014″ wire through the Judkins left catheter
into the mid-portion of the LAD.
(c) Advance an over-the-wire angioplasty catheter into the
LAD and place immediately distal to the second diagonal
branch, approximately where the catheter was placed for
the MI procedure (Fig. 2).
14. Connect an infusion manifold to each angioplasty catheter
(Fig. 3). Connect syringes containing the pretreatment, gene
transfer and flush solutions to the manifold (see Note 4).
15. Gene transfer (best if performed by two people) (see Note 1):
(a) Simultaneously expand both angioplasty balloons to 3 ATM.
(b) Infuse pretreatment solution over 3 min (see Note 3):
5 ml into each vessel at a flow rate of 1.66 ml/min (slightly
faster than 0.5 ml every 20 s) (see Note 16).

allowing a wire to pass from the catheter hub to the tip (and thus allowing perfusion through the catheter). The monorail catheter has a solid core and the wire
passes from the tip to a port immediately proximal to the balloon. Either catheter
is suitable for the infarction procedure. An over-the-wire angioplasty catheter is
necessary for perfusion of gene transfer solutions. (b) The manifold attaching to
each angioplasty catheter hub is composed of two joined 3-way stopcocks. Two
12 ml syringes are attached to the side ports for pretreatment and virus solutions, and a 5 ml syringe is attached to the end port for saline flush. The order of
perfusion (pretreatment → virus → flush) causes the last drops of each solution
to be flushed through the system by the next solution

(c) Infuse gene transfer solution over 2 min: 6 ml into each
vessel at a flow rate of 3 ml/min (1 ml every 20 s).
(d) Infuse saline flush over 10 s (2 ml per vessel).
(e) During and after solution infusions, pace using the ICD if
the heart rate decreases a clinically significant amount and
defibrillate immediately if sustained ventricular arrhythmias occur. These functions are best automated by programming the ICD appropriately prior to starting the
gene transfer procedure.
(f) Deflate the angioplasty balloons.

16. After completion of the infusion protocol, remove the catheters.
When the heart rate and blood pressure are stable, remove the
sheaths and repair or ligate the vessels.
17. Monitor the animal until awake and return to the holding pen.
18. Transgene functional testing is generally performed 4–7 days
after gene transfer for adenovirus, 1–2 months after gene
transfer for AAV, or whenever consistent with experimental
goals.

General Notes

1. Adequate staffing of the procedures is essential for animal survival. The infarction procedure requires a surgeon with experience in vessel cut-down and coronary catheterization, a
non-scrubbed assistant who can pass equipment and supplies
to the surgeon and perform chest compressions if needed, and
a recorder who is responsible for anesthesia, drug administration, external defibrillation, rhythm and vital signs monitoring. Noninvasive assessment of arrhythmia inducibility can
generally be performed by two people, one to operate the
ICD programmer, external defibrillator and electrophysiology
recording system and the other to monitor sedation, rhythm,
and vital signs. The gene transfer procedure is staffed with
individuals playing the same roles as the myocardial infarction
procedure, and an additional assistant surgeon is needed to
hold catheters in position and infuse the gene transfer solutions through one of the catheters (with the surgeon infusing
through the other catheter).
2. Pigs do not tolerate ventricular arrhythmias for longer than
several seconds. Close rhythm monitoring and prompt defibrillation is essential for animal survival.
3. Our research has shown that a minimum of 3 min exposure to
VEGF and nitroglycerin is needed to activate the intracellular
signaling pathways that increase vascular permeability.
Permeability effects of low calcium solutions are immediate.
Nitroglycerin and low calcium exposure needs to be continuous to maintain the driving force for permeability. VEGF can
be discontinued after the initial exposure (which is why it is
included in the pretreatment and not the gene transfer solution). Likewise, continuous exposure to adenosine, nitroglycerin and low calcium are needed to maintain vasodilation
through the gene delivery period.
4. It is critical to avoid infusion of air bubbles or any debris into
the coronary vasculature (particularly the coronary arteries).
All solutions should be sterile filtered to remove debris.

318

J. Kevin Donahue

Extreme caution should be used to eliminate air bubbles from
solutions, particularly during catheter or syringe connections.
5. Adequate heparinization is essential to avoid clot formation on
catheters placed in the arterial system or the coronary vasculature. We have seen fairly quick clot formation and adverse animal outcomes when heparin administration has lapsed.
4.2 Specific
Procedural Notes

6. For electrophysiology measurements, the level of isoflurane is
important because it affects multiple ion channels and produces a concentration-dependent effect on action potential
duration [24]. We strive to use a consistent dose of isoflurane
in all animals during electrophysiology assessment for consistency during measurement.
7. Flush out catheters and sheaths after initial insertion and prior
to use after any prolonged placement in the body. Coronary
guide catheters should contain side holes to allow perfusion of
the coronary artery while the catheter is in place.
8. ETCO2 assessment needs to consider that low ETCO2 can be
due to overventilation but it can also be due to decreased cardiac output. If the ETCO2 is decreasing during infarction, the
reason is likely cardiac output and reduction in ventilation is
inappropriate.
9. Dislodging the guide catheter after occlusion of the LAD needs
to be performed carefully so that the balloon is not dislodged
as well. The guide catheter needs to be pulled back at the same
time that the angioplasty catheter is pushed forward to move
the one catheter without moving the other. This maneuver
should be performed under fluoroscopic visualization.
10. The subject will move during defibrillation, so it is critical that
all catheters and sheaths (and any other equipment or supply
attached to the subject) be secured to avoid dislodgement
during defibrillation.
11. Dopamine is preferred during MI because the afterload
increasing effects of phenylephrine will increase cardiac workload. We only use phenylephrine when there is obvious vasodilation (warm red extremities), which can sometimes occur as
a result of the anesthetics.
12. Monitor blood pressure closely during amiodarone infusion.
We dilute the amiodarone to a total volume of 10 ml using
0.9 % saline and administer 1 ml boluses of this solution each
minute for 10 min.
13. Some protocols advocate prophylactic atropine prior to intubation for pigs. We have never done this, and we have not had
any problems. We use atropine only if bradycardia is hemodynamically limiting.

14. If the subject has any significant heart failure, ketamine alone
(15–25 mg/kg for pig) is used because the telazol–ketamine–
xylazine mixture depresses respiratory drive. We have never
seen this level of heart failure with our pig infarct-VT model.
We regularly see this level of heart failure in our pig atrial
fibrillation-heart failure model [25], and that experience
taught us that this is an essential modification for safe induction of anesthesia in heart failure animals.
15. In the pig, cannulation of the distal coronary sinus can be difficult because it continues at an acute angle where the azygous
vein inserts. A guide catheter with a broad curve and slight
upturn at the lip seems to be most effective. If the multipurpose catheter is not working, other options include hockey
stick, Judkins left, Amplatz left, or JCL shapes.
16. Adenosine is difficult to get into solution at room temperature. We heat it to 40–45 °C to make a stock solution of
50 mg/ml and then allow this to cool to room temperature.
We then add room temperature VEGF, nitroglycerin, and
saline to compose the pretreatment. For the virus solution, we
add room temperature nitroglycerin and saline. All solutions
are sterile filtered before use. The gene transfer solution has
ice-cold virus stock added at the last minute. Never cool adenosine containing solutions of either stock of treatment concentration or it will precipitate. The volume of virus stock is
never enough to alter solution temperature sufficiently to be a
problem.

Targeting Pulmonary Hypertension

Chapter 23
MicroRNA Delivery Strategies to the Lung
in a Model of Pulmonary Hypertension
Lin Deng, Andrew H. Baker, and Angela C. Bradshaw
Abstract
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by enhanced proliferation of pulmonary artery
smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells associated with obliteration of small pulmonary arterioles and
formation of plexiform lesions. To date, no curative treatments have been identified for pulmonary arterial
hypertension. There are various therapeutic options, including conventional medical therapies and oral,
subcutaneous, intravenous, and inhalation delivery. We have previously shown that miR-143/145 knockout can prevent the development of chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) in mice.
Here, we use chronic hypoxia-induced PH as a disease model to evaluate miR-143/145 inhibition after
delivery of antimiRNAs via the subcutaneous or intranasal routes. We use qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence to confirm that both delivery strategies efficiently inhibit miR-143/145 in lung tissue from mice
with chronic hypoxia-induced PH.

Introduction
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease that
leads to substantial morbidity and eventual death. PAH is characterized by marked remodeling of the distal pulmonary arteries,
which causes increased pulmonary vascular resistance [1]. One of
the major challenges in treatment of PAH is the effective delivery
of PAH therapeutics to sites of pathological vascular remodeling
(mainly small distal pulmonary arteries) [2]. Our group was the
first to report broad dysregulation of miRNA during the development of PAH [3]. Several studies subsequently demonstrated that
miRNAs play a critical role in PAH pathogenesis. Therapeutic
miRNA delivery to the lung in animal PAH models has been
achieved via several routes: (a) subcutaneous injection [4, 5], (b)
intravenous delivery [6], (c) intranasal delivery [7], (d) intratracheal delivery [8], and (e) intraperitoneal injection [9].

Lin Deng et al.

Here, we demonstrate that miRNA within lung tissue can
effectively be targeted via subcutaneous injection or intranasal
administration of antimiRNA locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotides (“antimiRNAs”) to mice. For subcutaneous delivery, two
doses of antimiR-143 or antimiR-145 were administered to mice
at a concentration of 25 mg/kg on days 1 and 7 during a 14-day
hypoxia exposure period. Treatment with antimiR-143 or antimiR145 prevented the development of chronic hypoxia-induced
PAH. Moreover, subcutaneous administration of antimiR-143 at
days 14 and 17 of a 21-day chronic hypoxia exposure period effectively rescued PAH in this model. Finally, two 5 mg/kg doses of
intranasal antimiR-145 to mice significantly decreased the levels of
miR-145 in the lung [4, 5].

Methods

3.1 Chronic HypoxiaInduced Pulmonary
Hypertension (PH)
Model

1. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the
UK Animal Procedures Act (1986) and to the “Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” published by the US
National Institutes of Health.

Lin Deng et al.

2. A hypobaric hypoxia chamber is used for the development of
hypoxia-induced PH.
3. Mice should be housed in clean cages supplied with ample
food and water, at least six mice per group (see Note 5).
4. For acclimatization, the hypoxic chamber is only depressurized from ~1000 mbar (ambient room pressure) to 750 mbar
on the first day (at a rate of 50 mbar/h).
5. The next day, the chamber is depressurized from 750 to
550 mbar (~10 % O2). Pressure is then maintained at 550 mbar
for a continuous period of 14 days (see Note 6). Sustained
hypoxia induces pulmonary vasoconstriction leading to the
development of pulmonary hypertension.
6. A temperature of 21–23 °C and relative humidity of 30–50 %
should be maintained in the hypoxia chamber.
7. Bedding, food and water should be changed every 5 days
(see Note 7).
3.2 Subcutaneous
Injections
of AntimiRNA and Cy3
Labeled AntimiRNA

1. All injections must be performed using sterile needles and
syringes, with fresh needles and syringes used for each mouse
(see Note 8).
2. The antimiRNA solution should be brought to room temperature prior to administration, and diluted to the appropriate dose. The effective dose for each animal is 25 mg/kg, for
example, an 8-week old female mouse will weigh ~20 g so the
actual dose required per animal will be in the region of 0.5–
0.625 mg (see Note 9), diluted in 200 μl PBS.
3. No anesthesia is required for subcutaneous administration.
The animal should be restrained by scruffing on a level surface.
Applying light downwards pressure to the animal, insert the
needle of the syringe into the loose skin fold over the neck that
is held between the fingers in the scruff (Fig. 1). Inject the
antimiRNA solution slowly into the neck fold. Larger volumes
(>50 μl) will leave a visible rounded pouch beneath the skin.
Animals can then be returned to their cages.
4. For our pulmonary hypertension studies, we administer two
successive doses of 25 mg/kg antimiRNA subcutaneously, at
days 1 and 7 of a 14-day period of chronic hypoxia.
5. The design of the subcutaneous injection regimen is shown in
(Fig. 2).
6. Following sacrifice and tissue harvest, immunofluorescence
can be used to detect Cy3-labeled antimiRNA and qRT-PCR
can be used to evaluate the extent of miRNA repression after
treatment. An example from antimiR-143 treated animals is
shown in (Fig. 3).

3.3 Intranasal
Delivery of AntimiRNA

1. All intranasal instillations must be performed using 200 μl
sterile pipette tips, with fresh tips used for each mouse.
2. Prior to intranasal instillation, the mice should be anesthetized
via exposure to 3 % (v/v) isoflurane in O2 (see Note 10). Once
the animals are under shallow anesthesia, mice should be held
as shown (Fig. 4), with the body tilted at a 45° angle. Using a
200 μl pipette, gently administer 25 μl dropwise to each nare,

Tissue Harvest

For pulmonary hypertension studies, tissues harvested include
lung, pulmonary arteries and heart.
1. Sacrifice the animal using a Schedule I method, for example
cervical dislocation.
2. After excision of sternal skin using surgical scissors and opening
of the peritoneal cavity, cut away the diaphragm by grasping the
xiphisternum with forceps and puncturing the diaphragm using
the scissor tips. This will deflate the lungs and allow careful
excision of the diaphragm around the base of the ribcage.

MicroRNA Delivery to Lung

3. Open the chest cavity along the midline by excising the sternum longitudinally, cutting up to the neck.
4. Expose the lungs by cutting away the ribcage from the sternal
incision (see Note 11).
5. Flush the pulmonary vasculatures with PBS (see Note 12) by
grasping the apex of the heart with toothless forceps and
injecting 5 ml PBS with 5 ml syringe into right ventricle with
a small gauge needle (25 G) (see Note 13).
6. Excise the whole lungs and heart, including the aortic arch
and pulmonary arteries, weigh on the scale, and then place in
cold PBS.
7. The pulmonary artery begins at the base of the right ventricle,
which branches into left and right pulmonary arteries. Cut
all the fat and superficial tissues surrounding the heart and
pulmonary artery, and remove the aorta and bronchus artery
carefully without damaging the pulmonary artery. Using blunt
forceps to hold the pulmonary artery branch and cut with scissors at the right ventricle and left and right lung lobes.
8. Collect individual lung lobes using scissors and forceps. We fix
the left lung lobe overnight in 10 % formalin for paraffin embedding, the right superior lobe and post-caval lobe are snap-frozen
in liquid nitrogen or on dry ice for use in protein extraction, the
right middle lobe is snap-frozen for RNA extraction, and the
right inferior lobe is embedded in OCT for cryo-sectioning. To
facilitate sectioning, lungs can be cryoprotected after fixation in
4 % PFA by incubating in a 30 % sucrose solution at 4 °C overnight before embedding in OCT (see Note 14).
3.5 Right Ventricle
Hypertrophy
Assessment

1. Right ventricle hypertrophy is assessed after dissecting the
whole heart.
2. Remove the atrial, large vessels and pericardial fat by careful
dissecting with forceps and scissors under a dissecting
microscope.
3. The right ventricle free wall (RV) is separated from the left
ventricle plus septum (LV + S) by careful dissection using
Springbow microsurgical scissors and forceps.
4. RV: LV + S ratios are calculated after weighing both dissected
RV and (LV + S); the ratio of RV/(LV + S) can be used as an
index of PH.

3.6 Evaluation
of miRNA Expression
in Tissue Samples
by qRT-PCR
(See Note 15)

1. Snap-frozen lung, pulmonary artery and right ventricular tissues are disrupted and homogenized using the QIAGEN
TissueLyser II system, with 5 mm stainless steel beads with
700 μl QIAzol lysis reagent. Total RNA is then extracted using
the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit together with DNase treatment following manufacturer’s instructions.

2. Total RNA is quantified using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific). RNA purity can be evaluated
using the A260/A280 ratio, with a ratio of ~2.0 accepted as
good RNA purity.
3. For miRNA qRT-PCR, cDNA is synthesized using stem-loop
reverse transcription primers as per the Taqman microRNA
assay protocol (Applied Biosystems, Paisley, UK). RNA should
first be diluted to a concentration of 2 ng/μl concentration.
4. Add the miRNA-RT reaction as shown in Table 1 (see Note 16).
5. The thermal cycler program for miRNA-RT is in Table 2.
6. Taqman qPCR Reaction as in Table 3: add 20.5 μl RNase-free
H2O to the RT product, and mix thoroughly (see Note 17).
7. For each probe tested, a negative reverse transcription control
should be run alongside a nuclease-free water control. All
qPCR experiments are performed in triplicate wells using the
7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems).
Thermal cycling conditions begin with a 10 min incubation
period at 95 °C, then followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C
and then 60 s at 60 °C.
8. Calculate the mRNA expression relative to the control sample
using the −2ΔΔCt method. For miRNA expression analyses in
mouse tissue, we use U6 as a housekeeping gene.

1. Microscope slides of 6 μm OCT lung sections should be
removed from −80 °C storage 20 min prior to use and allow
them to thaw at room temperature (see Note 18).
2. Using a wax pen, draw rings around sections (see Note 19),
then fix by incubating in 4 % PFA for 10 min at room
temperature.
3. Wash sections twice with PBS for 5 min, then permeabilize
tissues by incubating with 0.1 % Tween20 (in PBS; PBS-T) for
10 min (see Note 20). All washes should be carried out at
room temperature.
4. Wash sections three times with PBS for 5 min, then block nonspecific reactive sites by incubating with 10 % goat serum
diluted in PBS-T for 30 min at room temperature.
5. After one 5-min wash with PBS, add primary antibodies to
sections (made up in 1 % goat serum diluted in PBS-T) and
incubate in a humidified chamber overnight at 4 °C (see Note
21). For our experiments, we used an α-SMA antibody diluted
1:200 to 1 μg/ml.
6. The next day, sections should be washed three times in PBS
for 5 min prior to incubation with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies raised in goat (in the example presented in
(Figs. 3 and 6), an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
antibody is used). These antibodies are used at a 1:500 dilution in PBS at an effective concentration of 4 μg/ml. Sections
should be incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room
temperature, in a darkened humidified chamber.
7. Wash sections three times in PBS for 5 min in the dark, before
mounting sections using ProLong Gold antifade mountant
containing DAPI. Slides should be allowed to cure at room
temperature overnight in the dark before visualizing by confocal microscopy (see Note 22).

Notes
1. Pulmonary hypertension occurs more frequently in females, so
female mice are more commonly used in studies of chronic
hypoxia-induced PH, except in cases where gender differences
in PH susceptibility or development are being evaluated. We
have not observed any gender-specific differences in antimiRNA delivery efficacy.
2. AntimiRNA should be prepared and diluted in sterile
PBS. AntimiRNA solutions can be aliquoted into smaller volumes (we suggest aliquoting into single-use doses) and stored
at −80 °C until required.
3. For Cy3-labeled miRNAs, you can buy the antimiRNA, premiRNA, or miRNA mimic and the label kit (Silencer® siRNA
Labeling Kit with Cy™3 dye) to label the miRNAs.
4. Stability of housekeeping gene expression between treatment
groups should be verified for each experiment. If U6 is not
stable, alternative housekeeping gene candidates are
snoRNA202 or snoRNA234.
5. Generally, researchers consider six mice per group as an adequate sample size for PAH studies on mice using the chronic
hypoxia model. Here, we recommend a group size of ten
mice, to cover attrition rates during the hemodynamic
measurements.
6. The atmospheric pressure in the chamber should remain stable
at 550 mbar. We recommend checking pressures each day to
avoid discrepancies due to pressure fluctuations.
7. To ensure animal safety when opening the hypoxic chamber to
replace cages, food and water, increase pressure to 1000 mbar
at a rate of 100 mbar/h. After changing cages, food and water,
return the hypoxic chamber pressure to 550 mbar by depressurizing at a rate of 100 mbar/h.
8. For subcutaneous injection, it is not usually necessary to sterilize the skin, but you can prepare the injection site with 70 %
ethanol if required. The syringe needle should be inserted
between the fingers grasping the neck skin and should be
directed toward the posterior of the mice.
9. Excess antimiRNA volumes should be prepared for each injection, to ensure that each mouse receives a full dose.
10. Mice should be maintained under shallow anesthesia, as to
ensure the antimiRNA solution is inhaled spontaneously.
Delivery should take no more than 30 s, however if the mice
regain consciousness during the procedure they can be reanesthetized to finish the delivery.

MicroRNA Delivery to Lung

11. When cutting away the diaphragm, be careful to avoid puncturing the lungs using the dissecting scissors.
12. The pulmonary vasculatures are flushed with PBS to remove
blood from the lung and heart and to ensure that remnant
antimiRNA in the systemic circulation does not affect tissue
analyses.
13. It is necessary to cut the liver or the abdominal aorta to let the
perfusate flow out when flushing the pulmonary vasculature.
14. Dissected tissues that will be used for RNA/protein extraction
and OCT blocks should be stored at −80 °C until they are
processed.
15. When using Taqman primers and probes to assess the expression of miRNAs, reagent usage can be minimized by using
384-well plates. We perform our assays in triplicate to reduce
variation due to technical pipetting errors.
16. When preparing Taqman Mastermixes, include excess volume
(2–5 wells) in your calculations.
17. In order to avoid pipetting errors, we dilute the RT product
with 20.5 μl RNase-free H2O before adding 2.5 μl to each well
of the 384-well plate.
18. Storage and cutting of cryostat sections can be made easier by
using disposable base molds for embedding tissue samples in
OCT. Different tissues require varying temperature settings
on the cryostat: for lung tissue, we typically cut at −16 °C.
19. Drawing rings around sections with a hydrophobic (wax)
pen reduces the volume of reagents required for
immunofluorescence.
20. When only a few slides are being processed for immunofluorescence, washes can be carried out in a Coplin jar to minimize
the volume of buffer required.
21. A humidified chamber is required in order to prevent evaporation from sections, which will cause uneven or false staining.
22. If sections need to be visualized immediately by confocal
microscopy, clear nail lacquer applied around the edges of
coverslips can be used to prevent the liquid mounting medium
from leaking out onto the microscope objectives.

Abstract
Chronic pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with right ventricular failure and high mortality regardless
of the underlying disease. Currently, therapies can improve clinical outcomes in specific subsets of patients, but
have little impact on the progression of pulmonary vascular remodeling. Upon new advances in vector development and delivery techniques, gene therapy is a novel strategy in this field with the potential of overcoming
the main limitations of approved drug therapies: modulation of novel anti-remodeling targets and selective
pulmonary vasculature targeting with minimal systemic effects. In the recent years, several reports have shown
that gene transfer to the pulmonary vascular system is feasible in rodent models of PH. Our group has focused
on the translation of airway delivery of viral vectors in small and large animals. Here, we describe a procedure
to achieve vector transduction at the distal vasculature in animal models of PH and the methods to evaluate
the outcomes of this intervention as a promising new approach in pulmonary vascular diseases.

Introduction
Pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) is defined by the development of
vessel wall remodeling changes in the distal pulmonary vasculature,
and is a consequence of a heterogeneous group of clinical conditions
[1]. In the clinical setting, PVD is characterized by progressive dyspnea and exercise intolerance, and diagnosis relies on the detection of
pulmonary hypertension (PH) upon right heart catheterization. PH
is defined by a mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressure above 25 mmHg
[1], and based on available clinical studies, underlying PVD is suspected by additional hemodynamic abnormalities in the pulmonary
circulation, such as increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR),
transpulmonary gradient or diastolic to PA wedge pressure differences [1–3]. The main determinant of prognosis in patients suffering
PH is the impact of sustained high afterload on right ventricular function, leading to premature heart failure and death [4].

Current therapeutic options for chronic PH are largely dependent on the clinical classification for each patient undergoing the
diagnostic process [1]. Advances in the cellular and molecular
mechanisms involved in Group 1 PH (also designated as pulmonary
arterial hypertension, PAH) have led to novel drug developments
targeting the main pathways including endothelin receptor antagonists, prostacyclin analogs and activators of the soluble guanylate
cyclase (sGC)/cGMP axis (phosphodiesterase five inhibitors, and
more recently, sGC activators) [1]. Clinical trials for these drugs
have focused on Group 1 PH, while some benefit may be present in
other groups with novel agents [5, 6], in particular groups 2 (PH
due to left heart disease) and 4 (chronic thromboembolic PH).
Limitations for the widespread use of current vasodilator drugs
include the frequency of systemic, undesired side effects, lack of
long-term sustained clinical benefits, as well as a high economic
cost of these treatments [1]. In addition, during the past few years,
the unraveling of novel molecular mechanisms involved in PH
have set growing interest in developing more specific, target-driven
therapeutic strategies. In this regard, gene therapy may overcome
some of the limitations of current treatments, by selectively modulating novel pathways that are not targeted by any drug at present
[7]. Recently, several studies by independent groups have shown
the potential therapeutic benefit of modulating a variety of molecular targets using gene therapy [7, 8]. For instance, endothelial
NOS, prostacyclin synthase or BMPR2 have been successfully
modulated in the pulmonary vasculature leading to improved
hemodynamics in animal models of PH [9–11].
In order to develop gene therapy strategies for PH, vectors that
efficiently target the pulmonary vasculature and provide sustained
expression of the gene of interest are needed. In this regard,
advances in viral vector technology have made available the recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAV)s that allow different tissue
tropisms based on the capsid proteins composition, while eliciting
minimal immune response. In addition, delivery methods that preferentially transduce the lung vasculature with minimal exposure of
the vector to off-target tissues are essential to guarantee the feasibility, safety, and translatability of this strategy for PH patients [12].
The purpose of this protocol is to describe a novel airway
delivery method of vectors in large animal models of PH that efficiently transduces the distal pulmonary circulation and elicits
improvements in vascular remodeling and hemodynamics.

Methods

3.1 Animal
Preparation and PH
Model Creation

1. Fast the animals overnight. Administer prophylactic antibiotics
prior to surgery.
2. Anesthesia is induced with intramuscular administration of
6.0 mg/kg Telazol (tiletamine/zolazepam). Orotracheal intubation is performed first by trained personnel, and peripheral oxygen saturation and heart rate are continuously monitored (see
Note 1). A peripheral ear vein access is subsequently obtained.
3. For surgical procedures (surgical PH model creation), inhaled
isoflurane (1–3 %) is adjusted according to animal sedation status. Analgesia after the procedure is provided using postoperative 25–50 μg/h fentanyl patch. During the procedure, oxygen
saturation, heart rate, and systemic blood pressure are continuously monitored. Animals are given prophylactic antibiotics
twice daily for 5 days after the thoracotomy.
4. Surgical creation of the PH model in swine. A left lateral thoracotomy at the fifth intercostal space is performed under sterile conditions (see Note 2). Remove the lung from surgical site
by applying a wet gauze and squeeze (see Note 3). Obtain a
good view of the left atrial posterior wall where pulmonary
veins enter. Widen the incision if necessary.
5. The superior left pulmonary vein and the common inferior
pulmonary vein are carefully dissected in the extrapericardial
space close to the left atrium. Consistent degree of venous stenoses are achieved by placing a cotton umbilical tape around a
3.5-mm diameter plastic cylinder that is subsequently removed
once the tape is tightly secured (see Note 4).
6. Close the chest in layers, making sure that all air is evacuated
using a drainage chest tube. Furosemide 4 mg/kg is given after
the procedure to prevent acute pulmonary edema [13, 14].

3.2 Functional
Evaluation of PH in
Large Animals:
Hemodynamic and
Echocardiography
Assessments

1. Follow the same anesthesia induction as in Subheading 2.2.
Use intravenous propofol 8–10 mg/kg/h for hemodynamic
evaluation (see Note 5).
2. Transthoracic echocardiography can be used for right ventricle
(RV) noninvasive imaging and is convenient to perform within
the animal facility. Apical views of the RV can be obtained with
the animal on right lateral recumbency by placing the probe in
the sub-xiphoid position. Modified apical views of the RV and

Intra-Airway Delivery

343

Fig. 1 Right ventricular noninvasive characterization using echocardiography allows evaluation of the PH
model and the changes induced by therapeutic gene transfer. Two- (a) and three (b) dimensional datasets can
be obtained from modified apical views in swine models, as well as the Doppler spectral signal (c) for time
intervals and Tei index

3D datasets can be acquired with ECG gating (Fig. 1). Offline
analyses provides quantitative information of RV dimensions
and performance [13].
3. Under sterile conditions, a femoral vascular access is obtained
using the Seldinger technique. For right heart catheterization
with a 7 French Swan-Ganz catheter, an 8-Fr sheath is placed
in the femoral vein (see Note 6). As an alternative, the jugular
veins can also be accessed in swine but care must be taken to
avoid undesired carotid artery punctures.
4. Positioning of the Swan-Ganz catheter to obtain right side
hemodynamics is achieved using fluoroscopic guidance
(C-arm). Calibrate pressure sensor carefully. This is particularly
important when measuring right side pressures as they are
often much lower than left side pressures. Before measurements are obtained, hemodynamic stability must be obtained
and the catheter locations should be confirmed for every measurement (see Note 7).
3.3 Airway Gene
Delivery

1. Therapies should be preceded by hemodynamic measurements
to obtain baseline values. Gene delivery can be performed subsequently. Connect an airway filter to the tracheal tube.
2. Research personell in the operating room should take appropriate precautions for vectors (see Notes 8 and 9).

344

Jaume Aguero et al.

Fig. 2 Intratracheal gene delivery requires a MicroSprayer device (a) that is placed near the carina guided by
fluoroscopy (b)

3. The vector is prepared in the injection syringes (see Note 10).
4. The aerosolizer device is inserted carefully through the endotracheal tube and the position of the tip determined using fluoroscopic guidance (see Note 11). By inserting the aerosolizer
tip in a 7 Fr multipurpose coronary diagnostic catheter, cut to
fit the Sprayer inside, the device can be advanced in the trachea
while avoiding undesired damage in the tracheal mucosa. Once
the tip of the aerosolizer is 2–3 cm proximal to the tracheal
bifurcation, the multipurpose coronary diagnostic catheter is
gently pulled back a few cm (Fig. 2).
5. The total vector dose is split into three equal aliquots that will be
injected in the dorsal, right, and left lateral recumbent positions,
allowing at least 5 min between each injection (see Note 12).
6. Injection of the vector solution should be coordinated to the
inspiration phase. Also, pre-injection alveolar recruitment
maneuvers using the Ambu will facilitate a more even and distal distribution of the vector.
7. After vector delivery is completed, mechanically ventilate for
an additional 20–30 min with continuous monitoring of the
EKG, hemodynamics, and respiratory parameters.
8. Once the observation period is finished without complications,
the animal is recovered. The vector leak from the airway is
minimal; however, keep the precaution materials on throughout the procedure.
3.4 Evaluation
of the Transduction
Efficiency

1. Humanly euthanize the animals after an appropriate time postgene delivery to allow transgene expression. Through a median
sternotomy, lung tissue from both side of the lungs at different
lobes are collected. Remove blood from the tissue specimens
by perfusing the vessels with PBS (see Note 13).

Intra-Airway Delivery

345

Fig. 3 Lung tissue is inflated with OCT for easier handling and ulterior staining techniques

2. For lung tissue fixation, gently insufflate the airway with
50 % OCT in PBS, embed in labeled OCT molds and freeze
the blocks. Using a cryotome, sections (8–10 μm) are prepared on glass slides for subsequent staining (see Note 14)
(Fig. 3).
3. The staining technique to detect transgene expression depends
on the reporter or protein of interest. For vectors with the
lacZ reporter, the product of β-galactosidase activity can be
detected in brightfield microscopy using the X-Gal staining
kit. However, detection of β-galactosidase using specific primary antibodies is more sensitive and can be more precisely
localized using confocal microscopy. For specific proteins of
interest, primary antibodies that are well validated in swine
tissue are needed. Colocalization with specific cell type markers such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (for smooth muscle
cells) or endothelial NOS (endothelial cells) allows a more
clear identification of preferential cell type of gene expression
(see Note 15) (Fig. 4).

after the delivery procedure, β-galactosidase protein is found in the pulmonary vasculature (pink, a). Upon
delivery of the AAV1.CMV.SERCA2a vector, overexpression of SERCA2a protein (red, b) colocalizes with smooth
muscle cells (green, b)

Notes
1. In animals with moderate to severe PH, hypoxia can significantly worsen the hemodynamics and animals can easily die
from brief hypoxia. Oxygen should be supplied continuously
during the preparation, and rapid intubation and immediate
ventilation is necessary to prevent prolonged hypoxemia that
may influence the stability of the hemodynamic evaluation.
2. When entering the pleural cavity, use caution not to injure the
lung. Cutting the pleural membrane during the expiration will
reduce the risk of accidental injury.
3. Lungs can be inflated using an Ambu bag after banding the
pulmonary veins.
4. The optimal degree of vein stenosis depends of the animal
growth rate. Applying too tight of a stenosis can cause subacute lung edema that develops 2–3 h after surgery. The data
provided applies to female Yorkshire swine with BW 10–13 kg.
5. Some anesthesia drugs such as isoflurane have a strong vasodilatory effect and can mask mild PH.
6. Guidance of the percutaneous puncture using vascular echography minimizes the number of attempts and vascular injury,
and is advisable if repeated right heart catheterization procedures to monitor hemodynamics overtime are planned.

Intra-Airway Delivery

7. Appropriate ventilation parameters are set depending on the
investigators needs. The following parameters provide stable
and reproducible conditions under general anesthesia in our
experience: oxygen inspiratory fraction 40 %, 10 ml/kg tidal
volume at 15 respirations per minute to maintain an end-tidal
CO2 between 35 and 45 mmHg as determined by capnography. A portable blood gas analyzer provides a detailed blood
gas profile that can be particularly informative in diseased animals. Cardiac output is determined by thermodilution.
8. When testing vectors that can affect research personnel, personal protective equipment including gloves, gowns, shoe covers, respirators, face shields and safety glasses must be worn
during the viral vector delivery procedures and animal necropsies. The risk of infection by exposure to an infectious aerosol
must be minimized by primary containment and multiple secondary barriers such as specialized ventilation systems, air
treatment systems to decontaminate or remove agents from
exhaust air, and controlled access zones.
9. We have previously used AAV vectors using this delivery
method [12]. According to the NIH Guidelines, recombinant
AAVs in which the transgene does not encode either a potentially oncogenic gene product or toxins, and are produced in
the absence of a helper virus can in most cases be handled at
Biosafety Level 1. Decontamination of working areas is recommended. Experiments must be performed in accordance with
the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee for the use of AAV in these animals.
10. If the vector should be kept cold to maintain its activity, vector
preparation should be done by a second operator after placing
the Sprayer in the appropriate position.
11. An L-shape connector with a hole for inserting the sprayer will
facilitate the procedure and reduce vector leak from the animal.
12. Raising the head by 20 cm will facilitate a more distal deposition of the injected solution.
13. Lung adhesions at the site of surgical manipulation is frequent
in these animal models. This may limit the integrity of certain
regions of the lung parenchyma.
14. Cryosectioning of the lung OCT block may be challenging
especially when incomplete airway insufflation is present. As an
alternative, prior fixation in 10 % formalin can be used. In formalin-fixed paraffin blocks, deparaffination and the antigen
retrieval step with sodium citrate pH 6.0 may yield good
immunostaining results for many of the antibodies.
15. Due to cellular turnover, the gene expression signal detected
using different techniques may fade overtime.
