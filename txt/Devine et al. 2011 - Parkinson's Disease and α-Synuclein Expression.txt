A B S T R A C T : Genetic studies of Parkinson’s disease over the last decade or more have revolutionized
our understanding of this condition. a-Synuclein was the
first gene to be linked to Parkinson’s disease, and is
arguably the most important: the protein is the principal
constituent of Lewy bodies, and variation at its locus is
the major genetic risk factor for sporadic disease. Intriguingly, duplications and triplications of the locus, as
well as point mutations, cause familial disease. There-

fore, subtle alterations of a-synuclein expression can
manifest with a dramatic phenotype. We outline the clinical impact of a-synuclein locus multiplications, and the
implications that this has for Parkinson’s disease pathogenesis. Finally, we discuss potential strategies for disease-modifying therapies for this currently incurable

Key Words: Parkinsonism; genetics; a-synuclein

The study of familial forms of Parkinson’s disease
(PD) has led to the discovery of over a dozen loci
linked to the disease and many of these genes have
now been cloned.1 The first was described in 1997: a
missense mutation in SNCA, encoding a-synuclein, in
affected members of a large Italian kindred, and 3
unrelated Greek families, with familial PD.2 The following year, a-synuclein was found to be the major
constituent of Lewy bodies—protein deposits that are
the defining neuropathological feature of the disease.3
Subsequently, triplication of the SNCA locus was
reported in a separate kindred with familial PD;
branches of this family had been previously reported,
but found via genealogical methods to be the same
(Iowa, Spellman-Muenter, Waters-Miller kindred).4–7
This demonstrates that SNCA multiplication, as well
as point mutations, can lead to PD.8 The affected individuals from this family, with 4 copies of SNCA
rather than the normal 2, were found to have a corre-

sponding doubling of SNCA messenger RNA and asynuclein protein in postmortem brain tissue.9 This
mechanism parallels that seen in Alzheimer’s disease
pathogenesis in which either increased dosage or missense mutations of the amyloid precursor protein
(APP) gene lead to early onset disease.10
Two large genomewide association studies have
established SNCA variation as the most important
genetic risk factor for sporadic PD.11,12 Understanding
a-synuclein biology is clearly pivotal to our understanding of PD, and much of the basic research into
this disease over the last decade has centered on this
protein. Here, we review the phenotypic range of
SNCA gene dosage alterations, and discuss how this
informs our understanding of PD pathogenesis, and
therefore how we might be able to treat it.

------------------------------------------------------------

The Iowa kindred is striking because of the spectrum of disease seen in family members, probably the
consequence of the large size of the kindred, described
since the early 1900s4–7 (video documentation available in Gwinn et al.13). Muenter et al.6 gave a detailed
account of 13 affected individuals from this family
over 4 generations with ‘‘hereditary parkinsonism
with dementia.’’ Clinical and pathological features of
most of the affected members were typical for PD

except for earlier age of onset (mean age 33 years)
and more fulminant course (mean life expectancy 8.1
years after disease onset, in contrast to 18.4 years in
sporadic PD with onset before age 50 years14).
Many affected individuals in the family have carried
the diagnosis of PD, and met published clinical criteria
(except for a positive family history).15 Positron emission tomography scanning with 6-[18F]fluorodopa has
revealed severe depletion of striatal dopamine in those
family members with typical PD clinically,6 and the
presence of Lewy bodies and neuronal loss in the substantia nigra has been well described.6,16 However,
others have more prominent and early dementia, with
parkinsonism, hallucinations, and fluctuations in cognition, consistent with dementia with Lewy bodies
(DLB), which has been correlated pathologically with
cortical Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites.17 Another
individual in this family had clinical features of parkinsonism, dementia, and dysautonomia, and dramatic
a-synuclein immunoreactive glial inclusions were seen
at autopsy, neuropathologically consistent with multiple system atrophy (MSA).16
PD, DLB, and MSA are collectively known as synucleinopathies, because they feature intracellular a-synuclein deposition neuropathologically, and a-synuclein is
believed to be integral to their pathogenesis.18 Therefore, the clinical phenomenology within this 1 kindred
demonstrates that increased dosage of a-synuclein can
generate the full spectrum of synucleinopathies.

Additional SNCA Triplication Kindreds
Farrer et al.19 documented the Swedish-American
kindred with SNCA triplication after screening 42
probands with early-onset autosomal dominant PD.
The proband had a similar phenotype to some Iowa
kindred affecteds, with a rapidly progressive dopa-responsive parkinsonism starting age 31 years; postural
hypotension, visual and auditory hallucinations arose
14 years later with worsening dementia, severe generalized rigidity, and death at age 52 years. Elevated
SNCA messenger RNA (mRNA) was found in postmortem brain tissue of affecteds, with doubling of
a-synuclein protein, corroborating equivalent findings
in the Iowa kindred.9 Severe neuronal degeneration in
the substantia nigra and locus ceruleus, with widespread Lewy body pathology, was seen at autopsy.
There was also severe neuronal loss in the CA2/3 area
of the hypothalamus—unusual for PD or DLB but
similar to that seen in 6 of 7 autopsied cases from the
Iowa kindred.5,6,16
Ibanez et al.20 described a kindred with SNCA triplication after screening 22 families with atypical autosomal dominant parkinsonism. The 3 affecteds had
rapidly evolving symptoms with severe cognitive
impairment and short disease duration until death
(mean 7 years).

The fourth triplication kindred described is a Japanese family with 3 individuals of consecutive generations who had early-onset parkinsonism with
dementia and orthostatic hypotension.21 Triplication
was confirmed in the grandson, with disease onset at
31 years; his father had disease onset aged 31 years
(and died at age 40 years). The proband’s grandfather’s age of onset was 49 years (death at age 57
years).

SNCA Duplication Kindreds
a-Synuclein duplication is now recognized as a rare
cause of familial parkinsonism, including cases which
are phenotypically similar to idiopathic PD, with no
atypical features.22,23 Duplication has also been documented in sporadic PD—these cases are clinically
indistinguishable from idiopathic PD.20,24
However, more recent reports have described atypical features in duplication cases, with variability
within the same family.24,25 In 4 duplication kindreds,
11 members presented with parkinsonism, 6 of whom
developed hallucinations or delusions and 3 developed
dementia.26 All kindreds had asymptomatic carriers,
the oldest aged 79 years; the lifetime penetrance was
estimated at 43.8%. A recent screen found 2 patients
with a-synuclein duplication, parkinsonism developing
around the fifth decade, followed by rapid cognitive
decline, hallucinations, and orthostatic hypotension.27
Neither had any family history. The authors retrospectively reviewed 32 duplication patients and found
cognitive dysfunction in one-third. Autonomic involvement was seen in one-half, a similar prevalence to that
seen in triplication cases. The time course of disease
progression was also comparable to triplication cases,
but with an onset over 2 decades later. The SwedishAmerican kindred includes an individual with a-synuclein duplication,28 presenting with orthostatic
hypotension aged 71 years, parkinsonism a year later,
with frequent falls and urinary incontinence, although
tremor was very mild. Imaging revealed significant
reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) in both
striata. The clinical diagnosis was MSA.
Four members of a Japanese duplication kindred
developed dopa-responsive parkinsonism, accompanied by dementia and visual hallucinations during the
late stages of the disease.29 A further member developed parkinsonism aged 28 years, dementia aged 35
years, and died aged 48 years: a disease trajectory similar to many triplication cases. He was found to have
homozygous duplication of SNCA, due to consanguinuity in the family, and therefore had 4 copies of the
gene.
Overall, the data from these families demonstrate
that gene dosage of a-synuclein, rather than extent of
the replicated region, determines initiation of disease
and the severity of progression.20,30

Sporadic PD
How might increased a-synuclein dosage be relevant
to sporadic disease? Postmortem sporadic PD brain
tissue has a higher expression of a-synuclein mRNA
compared to controls,31 suggesting that a similar pathogenetic mechanism might be responsible.
Genomewide association studies reveal that variation at the SNCA locus is associated with sporadic
PD11,12 and variation at this locus has also been demonstrated in MSA.32 Polymorphisms in a complex
repeat site called Rep1, located 10 kb upstream of
the translational start of SNCA, have been linked to
sporadic PD and might account for these associations.33–36 A luciferase-based assay found a surprisingly large 3-fold difference in a-synuclein expression
with different Rep1 alleles in SH-SY5Y cells.37 Moreover, associations have been found between Rep1 and
levels of a-synuclein protein in blood samples from
PD patients38 and SNCA mRNA in control brain.39
Furthermore, a-synuclein mRNA varied 1.7-fold in
transgenic mice carrying the different Rep1 alleles.40 It
is not yet known whether the higher expressing mice
also have a higher incidence of PD-type pathology but
nevertheless, these data point to the possibility that
sporadic disease is also caused by higher expression of
a-synuclein.

possibly explained by the observed impaired microtubule dynamics and Golgi fragmentation that increase
local concentrations of a-synuclein in the soma,
whereas knockout of LRRK2 was protective.43 Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) deficiency leads to accumulation
of its substrate glucocerebroside, which has recently
been shown to stabilize oligomeric a-synuclein intermediates, permitting their conversion into fibrils,
meanwhile a-synuclein itself inhibits the normal lysosomal activity of glucocerebrosidase, leading to further
accumulation of glucocerebroside thus forming a pathogenic positive feedback loop.44 Recessive mutations
in Parkin cause young-onset disease.45 Parkin encodes
an E3 ubiquitin ligase that provides specificity for the
process of tagging proteins for degradation in the proteasome46 and PD-associated mutations disrupt this
ligase activity.47 A glycosylated form of a-synuclein
has been shown to be a potential target of this ligase
activity48 although it remains unclear whether this
form is pathologically relevant. Nevertheless, Parkin
mutations may also augment accumulation of a-synuclein via impairing its degradation in the proteasome.
Taking this clinical and genetic evidence together
(summarized in Fig. 1), what can we infer about the
possible
mechanisms
of
a-synuclein-mediated
pathogenesis?

Disruption of the Normal Role of a-Synuclein

Implications for a-Synuclein
Pathogenesis
These clinical studies point to a clear dosage relationship between a-synuclein and disease. Genetic variation in SNCA might increase risk of sporadic PD
through increasing expression, whereas 3 copies of the
locus rather than the normal 2 can, in around onehalf of individuals, lead to parkinsonism identical to
idiopathic PD (albeit with atypical features being
more common). However, 1 additional copy confers
full penetrance of what is in many cases an early-onset
condition, with clinical features that can encompass
PD, DLB, and MSA. Therefore, subtle alterations in
expression level are sufficient to cause a wide spectrum of disease. Degeneration may be confined to the
nigrostriatal pathway, but as a-synuclein dosage
increases, the likelihood of more widespread pathology (eg, cortical involvement in DLB or glial and cerebellar involvement in MSA) increases in tandem.
Table 1 summarizes the clinical features seen in the
multiplication kindreds.
Increased accumulation of a-synuclein is also seen
with dysfunction of several other PD genes, including
LRRK2 and GBA, mutations in which comprise the 2
most common genetic causes of PD.41,42 Overexpression of mutant LRRK2 increased a-synuclein deposition and neurodegeneration in A53T transgenic mice,

Synucleins are abundant neuronal proteins, enriched
in presynaptic termini,49 but their physiological role is
unknown. a-Synuclein knockout mice are normal,
apart from increased release of dopamine from nigrostriatal neurons under certain conditions, implying
that the protein can negatively regulate dopaminergic
neurotransmission.50 Given potential redundancy
between synucleins, this work was extended in triple
knockout mice lacking a-, b-, and c-synuclein; here, a
clear phenotype emerges of an age-dependent alteration in axonal morphology, neuronal dysfunction, and
decreased survival.51
Maintenance of protein complexes involved in synaptic release requires chaperone activity mediated by
synucleins; these protein complexes are decreased in
the abc-synuclein knockout mouse.52 Subtle overexpression of a-synuclein in mice, in a range similar to
that seen clinically, impaired neurotransmitter release
via defective synaptic vesicle recycling, in the absence
of overt toxicity.53 It remains to be seen whether this
functional perturbation can lead to neuronal loss over
the time course anticipated in PD.
a-Synuclein has been shown to bind to mitochondria, more so when overexpressed, impairing complex
I function, decreasing respiration and increasing free
radical production.54,55 In cultured cells and C. elegans, a-synuclein can also cause fragmentation and
dysfunction of mitochondria,56 which is relevant given

FIG. 1. Multiple pathways promote accumulation and aggregation of a-synuclein. Gene multiplications and certain Rep1 polymorphisms can
increase expression of a-synuclein directly. On the other hand, degradation of a-synuclein in the proteasome may be impaired by Parkin mutations.
LRRK2 mutations can fragment Golgi, disrupting vesicular trafficking and thereby increasing a-synuclein in the soma. Mutations in glucocerebrosidase cause accumulation of glucocerebroside, which stabilizes oligomeric a-synuclein, enhancing fibril formation. In turn, a-synuclein impairs physiological glucocerebrosidase function. Multiple environmental toxins, including heavy metal cations, organic solvents and pesticides, can enhance
misfolding and aggregation of a-synuclein. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]

the importance of mitochondria in maintaining neuronal viability in PD.57,58 Mice overexpressing the disease-associated A53T a-synuclein mutation develop
mitochondrial DNA damage and degeneration,59 and
a-synuclein pathology in this model is exacerbated by
exposure to paraquat.60 In contrast, dopaminergic
neurons in a-synuclein knockout mice are resistant to
the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).61
Overexpression of a-synuclein has also been shown
to impair macroautophagy, a major route for clearance of aggregate-prone intracytoplasmic proteins,
whereas a-synuclein depletion enhances this pathway.62 Overexpressing cells would also clear dysfunctional mitochondria less efficiently, increasing
susceptibility to apoptotic stimuli. The combination of
these perturbations, persisting over many decades,
might be sufficient to cause neuronal death.

of Lewy bodies and cellular loss: Lewy bodies are
present in 10% to 15% of individuals over the age of
65 years who die without clinical evidence of neurological illness, despite having an identical pattern of
deposition to that seen in PD or DLB.65 Cytotoxicity
in model systems can occur without aggregated a-synuclein.66 Lentiviral expression of a-synuclein in rat nigrostriatal neurons results in selective dopaminergic
toxicity, but without fibrillar inclusions, whereas missense mutations in SNCA (for example, A30P)
increases oligomerization of a-synuclein, but not fibril
formation.67,68 The hypothetical mechanism of toxicity is not clear but may be through disruption of membranes through the formation of pores.69 Lewy body
formation might, in fact, be an adaptive cellular
response, protecting neurons from the damaging
effects of oligomeric intermediates.

Toxicity of a-Synuclein

Transplantation of fetal dopamine neurons began
over 20 years ago as a potentially curative treatment
for PD.70 Recently, individuals with these transplants
have come to autopsy, with surprising results. Lewy
body pathology is observed in surviving neurons of
the patient, as expected. But in 8 patients who have
received this treatment, Lewy bodies were observed in
the transplanted dopaminergic neurons as well.71–73
These transplants have all been less than 14 years old,

Permissive Templating of a-Synuclein
Fibrillogenic monomers of a-synuclein form oligomeric intermediates that assemble into fibrils, and
finally deposit in Lewy bodies.63 a-Synuclein has a
strong tendency to self-aggregate in vitro, so increasing its expression would be expected to generate more
of these aggregates.64 However, a pivotal question is
which of these species, if any, are toxic to neurons.
For example, there is a dissociation between presence

which is thought to be too young for Lewy bodies to
arise de novo. An alternative explanation is that disease spreads from the host to the grafted cells, reminiscent of a prion-like process. Prion diseases are
characterized by spread of prion protein (PrP) from 1
organism to another. Healthy cellular PrP (designated
PrPc) is ubiquitously expressed and has the same
amino acid sequence as the disease-causing scrapie isoform (PrPSc) but a different secondary structure, being
composed largely of a-helices whereas PrPSc is predominantly b-sheets. Disease is caused by a change in
conformation of PrPc to PrPSc, which can act as a template for recruitment of PrPc, converting them into
PrPSc. Aggregates of the disease isoform build up, and
propagate between cells leading to disease progression.
Like PrP, a-synuclein is unstructured in aqueous buffers, while adopting a predominantly a-helical structure when membrane bound, which can become bsheet when present at high concentration or in mutant
form.74
a-Synuclein is present in cerebrospinal fluid and
plasma of healthy subjects and patients with neurodegenerative diseases,75,76 and can be detected in media
of neuronal culture models,77 suggesting that it can be
exocytosed. Recent studies have provided direct evidence of cell-to-cell spread: neurons overexpressing asynuclein can transmit the protein to neighboring neurons in culture, and to neural precursor cells in a
transgenic model of PD-like pathology,78 and also to
postmitotic nigrostriatal neurons, in a direct model of
the fetal transplantation clinical studies.79 Oligomers
of a-synuclein can recruit, and aggregate, a-synuclein
endogenously expressed by primary cortical neurons,
and this effect increases with time and also with concentration of the applied oligomers.80 In other words,
misfolded a-synuclein can operate as a template catalyzing further misfolding events.81
Transmission of misfolded a-synuclein between cells
provides a mechanistic basis for the findings of Braak
et al.82 where a-synuclein pathology extends sequentially from the dorsal motor nucleus in the lower
brainstem, to upper brainstem areas and from there to
the cerebral hemispheres. They speculate that PD pathology may arise first in the nose and foregut, which
act as portals for entry of an unknown neurotropic
pathogen, via inhalation or ingestion, and suggest that
this pathogen may trigger misfolding of a-synuclein.83
An alternative possibility is that an environmental
toxin, rather than a pathogen, is responsible. Many
potential neurotoxins, including metals, solvents, pesticides, and herbicides have been linked to PD (reviewed
in Uversky64). Paraquat and rotenone enhance production of a-synuclein in vivo, whereas in vitro, fibrillation of a-synuclein is dramatically accelerated by these
and other substances, including heavy metal cations
and organic solvents. These can all induce structural

perturbations in a-synuclein and stabilize partially
folded structures, which are prone to form fibrils.
Increased SNCA expression could cause PD by augmenting the likelihood of a-synuclein misfolding, the
quantity of exocytosed misfolded proteins, and the
speed of nucleation in recipient cells. Age is the major
risk factor for sporadic PD, and concentration of asynuclein increases with age in neuronal cell bodies.84
Therefore, in both SNCA multiplication and sporadic
PD, initiation of disease relates to and appears to be
dependent on the concentration of the pathogenic protein, perhaps through increasing the chances of a misfolding species to emerge, which could form a scaffold
for further proteins to misfold and aggregate.
a-Synuclein fibrillization starts in vitro with a lagphase while soluble oligomers form a nucleus, but
once the nucleus forms, aggregates grow rapidly.85
Therefore, the prediction would be that permissive
templating is efficient and less dependent on the concentration of the protein than the initial misfolding
event, such that the process becomes self-propagating.
This would explain the variable age of onset of disease, even in triplication cases, given the stochastic nature of protein misfolding. Recent data suggests that
prion propagation in vivo proceeds in 2 phases: an initial exponential phase not dependent upon levels of
PrPC, followed by a plateau phase prior to clinical
onset, the duration of which is shortened as endogenous PrPC levels are increased.86 The authors suggest
that toxicity is exerted by neither PrPC nor PrPSc but
via a toxic intermediate, generation of which requires
conversion to take place and is therefore dependent on
local availability of PrPC. If a similar mechanism is at
work in the synucleinopathies, the implication of
increasing SNCA expression becomes clear: time to
onset of disease is shorter.

Disease-Modifying Therapies for PD
Neither the physiological nor the pathogenic roles of
a-synuclein are understood. Nevertheless, the clinical,
genetic, and toxin studies described speak to the importance of a-synuclein concentration, and cell-to-cell
spread, in driving disease onset and progression.
Therefore, strategies that seek to either deplete or prevent the spread of a-synuclein ought to be clinically
beneficial.
A recent report of an inducible a-synuclein transgenic mouse model of DLB showed that reducing
a-synuclein expression triggered a reversal in pathological changes and improved behavior and memory.87
This provides proof of concept data that a-synuclein
depletion might not just slow disease progression, but
in fact reverse it. However, it is not yet clear how this
depletion should be achieved. Several studies have
employed RNA interference to successfully reduce

a-synuclein expression in cells,88 rodents,89,90 and primates,91 although reversal of pathological changes has
not been demonstrated with this approach so far.
Moreover, nigral degeneration caused by a-synuclein
silencing has been described in rat,92 precisely the opposite effect of that desired. The reasons for this are
not certain but, given that in vivo levels of a-synuclein
are likely to be tightly regulated, perhaps the goal
should be normalization of a-synuclein levels rather
than full suppression. There is also the wider problem
of turning such antisense strategies into viable drugs.
Problems with degradation of the oligonucleotides,
and off-target effects are commonly seen,93 notwithstanding the considerable difficulties of delivering such
an agent into the brain.
Enhancing degradation of a-synuclein protein might
be a viable possibility. Pharmacological upregulation
of autophagy has been shown to help clear the protein, for example.94 Antibody-based strategies also
look promising. Vaccination of human a-synucleinexpressing mice with human a-synuclein protein led to
degradation of aggregates of human a-synuclein, a
reduction in formation of new aggregates, and diminished neurodegeneration.95 Indeed, the presence of autoantibodies directed against a-synuclein has recently
been reported in PD patients, and antibody titers
reduce with progression of disease, implying that
immune-mediated clearance of a-synuclein may be a
factor in determining disease onset.96
Much current work focuses on a-synuclein depletion
as a possible therapeutic strategy. However, when we
consider the ascending pathology noted by Braak
et al.,82 the spectrum of pathology seen in the multiplication kindreds, and the presence of Lewy bodies in
grafted fetal dopaminergic neurons, then cell-to-cell
protein propagation begins to take on a central role in
the disease process. The mechanistic basis for this
propagation has not yet been fully defined. Nor is it
known whether it serves a physiological role. Nevertheless, blocking it is an attractive potential therapeutic target. This strategy may help preserve brain areas
not yet affected by the pathological process, if potentially toxic forms of a-synuclein are prevented from
reaching them. It might also avoid possible side effects
of excessive a-synuclein depletion. However, it
remains possible that cellular release of a-synuclein
might be a mechanism by which cells can lower concentrations of this protein before they become dangerously high. Therefore, it is conceivable that the
combination of a-synuclein depletion with blockade of
its propagation will be required to make a clinically
measurable impact on disease progression.
Research priorities are now clear. We need strategies
that normalize a-synuclein levels rather than fully
deplete it, and are deliverable intrathecally. In addition, we need to understand precisely how, and importantly why, a-synuclein propagates from cell to cell, in

mechanism.
