ABSTRACT: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small and evolutionary conserved noncoding RNAs that are involved in posttranscriptional gene regulation. Diﬀerential expression levels of miRNAs can be used as potential biomarkers of disease.
Previous animal studies have indicated that the expression level of miR-132 is negatively correlated with its downstream
molecule nuclear receptor related 1 protein (Nurr1), which is one of the key factors for the maintenance of dopaminergic
function and is particularly vulnerable in Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, this correlation has not been conﬁrmed in human
patients with PD. Moreover, the possible involvement of miR-132 during the pathogenesis and progression of PD is not fully
investigated. Therefore, in the present study, we determined the peripheral circulation levels of miR-132 and Nurr1 in patients
with PD, neurological disease controls (NDC) and healthy controls (HC) by reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR
(RT-qPCR). Our data clearly demonstrated that the plasma miR-132 level in PD was signiﬁcantly higher than those in HC
(178%, p < 0.05) and NDC (188%, p < 0.001). When adjusted for gender and age, higher level of miR-132 expression was
associated with the signiﬁcantly increased risk for PD in males and was closely related with the disease stages and disease
severity. Furthermore, peripheral Nurr1 was signiﬁcantly decreased in PD compared with HC (56%, p < 0.001) and NDC
(58%, p < 0.001). Much more interestingly, further analysis revealed a negative correlation between the decreased Nurr1 level
and the elevated miR-132 level in PD. All these ﬁndings indicated that the combination of a high miR-132 level with the low
level of its downstream Nurr1 might be a potential biomarker aiding in the diagnosis of PD and monitoring disease progression.

INTRODUCTION

systematic understanding of this disease and the current
treatments are mostly symptomatic.4 Moreover, the current
diagnosis of PD is based primarily on subjective clinical rating
of motor functions. By the time of diagnosis, over 60% of

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common
neurodegenerative disease in the world,1,2 pathologically
characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic (DAergic)
neurons in substantia nigra (SN) and the formation of Lewy
bodies (LB).3 Although great achievements have been made to
clarify the disease pathogenesis and explore potent therapeutic
strategies against PD for over 200 years, there is still no

DAergic neurons in the SN of PD patients are already lost.5
Since there is no reliable quantitative diagnostic test for PD,
the objective and measurable molecular biomarkers should be
critical to serve as potential clinical tool to facilitate PD
diagnosis and early intervention.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of ∼22 nt endogenous
RNA molecules.6 Mature miRNAs recognize and bind to the
3′ untranslated region of the message RNA (mRNA) by
speciﬁc complementary sequence, and then aﬀect the
expression of target genes.7 Several miRNAs have been
found to play important roles in DAergic neuronal diﬀerentiation, apoptosis and protection of PD.8,9 For instance,
miR-133b can regulate DAergic function negatively and aﬀect
PD pathogenesis by repressing the expression of Pitx3 gene, a
homeobox transcription factor required for the development
and mature of DAergic neurons;8 miR-7 and miR-153 protect
DAergic neurons from oxidative stress damage via altering αsynuclein expression;10,11 miR-433 induces overexpression of
α-synuclein indirectly by binding to the promoter region of
ﬁbroblast growth factor 20,12 while miR-128 suppresses the
accumulation of α-synuclein by targeting to transcription factor
EB;13 miR-132 dysregulation is associated with the changes of
momoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), D1- and D2-dopamine
receptor (DRD1 and DRD2) genes in dopamine receptor
signaling in Toxoplasma gondii infected mice.14
Among these above-mentioned miRNAs, we were particularly interested in miR-132, which have been reported to be
highly expressed in neurons, and signiﬁcantly altered in various
neurodegenerative disorders.15−18 The level of mesencephalon
miR-132 was found to be signiﬁcantly increased in rat PD
model, accompanied by a decreased Nurr1.19 Nurr1 is a
transcription factor20−22 that plays crucial roles in the
diﬀerentiation and functional maintenance of midbrain
DAergic neurons and the microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation.23,24 Our previous study demonstrated that overexpression
of miR-132 repressed embryonic stem (ES) cells diﬀerentiation into DAergic neurons by directly targeting Nurr1
gene,25 and Nurr1 expression level was decreased in the
patients with PD compared to health individuals.26,27
However, miR-132 expression level in PD patients and
controls, and the possible correlation between peripheral
levels of miR-132 and Nurr1 in PD patients has not been
determined.
In the present study, we recruited 269 patients with
diagnosed PD, 222 healthy controls (HC), and 176 patients

with various non-PD neurological disorder controls (NDC).
The main aims of the present study were to determine (1)
whether peripheral miR-132 expression level was signiﬁcantly
altered in patients with PD as compared with controls; (2)
whether age, gender, disease severity and medications aﬀect
miR-132 expression; (3) whether peripheral miR-132 had a
negative correlation with Nurr1 in PD patients.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In order to prove our hypothesis, we measured the relative
expression level of miR-132 in human plasma from patients
with PD, NDC, and HC by RT-qPCR. All 667 subjects
enrolled in this study were Han ethnic Chinese with the male/
female ratio at 392/275. Their ages ranged from 40 to 89 years
with a mean of 66.14 ± 0.66 years. The demographic
characteristics including age and gender of each group were
summarized in Table 1. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
among PD, HC, and NDC groups for the distribution of age
and gender in each group. In addition, total 345 available
peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) samples (142 PD, 98
HC, and 105 NDC) were used for the further determination of
Nurr1 expression and evaluation the correlation between
Nurr1 and miR-132. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in
both gender and age among all groups. The demographic
characteristics of the cohort of subjects for the Nurr1 gene
expression were summarized in Table 2.
miRNAs have been proposed as putative noninvasive
biomarkers in diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment
for several diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders
such as PD.28 In the present study, we aimed to measure the
relative expression of miR-132 and Nurr1 in human peripheral
blood from PD and controls. Our results showed that plasma
miR-132 expression was signiﬁcantly higher in PD than that in
HC (Figure 1, 0.32 ± 0.03 vs 0.18 ± 0.03, p < 0.05) and in
NDC (Figure 1, 0.32 ± 0.03 vs 0.17 ± 0.03, p < 0.001),
suggesting that plasma miR-132 expression level may be
specially altered.
In order to explore the possible impacts of age on the
changes of plasma miR-132 expression level, we analyzed the
correlation between miR-132 expression and age in both HC
and PD groups using Spearman’s correlation analysis. As
shown in Figure 2A, the coeﬃcient (R) results revealed no
correlation between miR-132 and age in HC (r = 0.117, p =
0.144) and PD groups (r = 0.048, p = 0.465), suggesting that
age did not inﬂuence the expression of plasma miR-132.

patients.29 Moreover, the expression levels of miR-132 were
varied among diﬀerent regions of the brain and presented in a
sex-dependent manner in mice with chronic Toxoplasma gondii
infection.30 It is conceivable that the signiﬁcant higher miR132 expression in male PD than female in our study may
suggest that gender inﬂuence might be involved in miR-132
expression and might play a role in diﬀerent ratio of male/
female PD.31
We further analyzed disease duration and severity (H-Y
score) in 269 patients with PD. We found that plasma miR-132
expression was associated with the disease duration. The
Spearman correlation analysis results revealed a positive
correlation between the relative expression of miR-132 and
duration in PD (r = 0.187, p = 0.006) (Figure 3A).
Consistently, similar association was also found between
miR-132 expression and H−Y scores (Figure 3B). In our
study, we analyzed plasma miR-132 expression level of 67 PD
patients who were of recent-onset and not yet been treated
with anti-PD medications (“naı̈ve” PD), we found that the
miR-132 expression in PD was signiﬁcantly increased in
comparison to that in HC (Figure 3C). We also analyzed the
miR-132 expression in 183 PD patients who were regularly
treated with ﬁrst- or second-line anti-PD medications,
including DA receptor agonists alone (DR, n = 16), levodopa
alone (L-dopa) (n = 69), or the combination of L-dopa and
DR (n = 98). Nineteen PD patients treated irregularly with
several other medications were not included in the analysis.
Interestingly, L-dopa treatment increased the miR-132
expression level of PD patients compared to HC, but there
was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence among the other four groups (PD,
naı̈ve, DR, L-dopa+DR, Figure 3C). Alieva et al.32 reported
that the level of miR-132 in PBL was increased in 18 L-dopatreated patients with PD compared with nontreated PD (H-Y

diﬀerent study groups. Fluorescent reading from real-time PCR
reaction was quantitatively analyzed by determining the diﬀerence of
Ct (ΔCt) between Ct of miR-132 and external control, and the miR132 expression was determined by the formation of 2−ΔCt. The level
of miR-132 expression was signiﬁcantly increased in patients with PD
(n = 269) as compared with healthy controls (HC, n = 222) and
neurological disease controls (NDC, n = 176). Horizontal bar

the diﬀerences in the relative miR-132 expression levels in individuals

Interestingly, we found a signiﬁcantly higher plasma miR-132
level in male PD than that in HC, while there was no diﬀerence
between PD and NDC (Figure 2B). It was reported that
miRNAs expression proﬁles were diﬀerentially expressed
between male and female in SN DAergic neurons of PD

correlation with the changes of plasma miR-132. Besides, in
contrast to the higher plasma miR-132 expression level in male
PD, we also found a signiﬁcantly lower level of Nurr1 in male
PD, as compared to HC and NDC (Figure 4B). We further
documented that Nurr1 was signiﬁcantly decreased in naı̈ve
PD comparing to HC (Figure S1).
Research on human peripheral blood is common in a clinic
study to identify disease biomarkers and evaluate disease
progression. miRNAs have been reported to be encapsulated in
microvesicles, which are secreted by circulating blood cells and
other cells from diﬀerent tissues.33,34 Kim and colleagues8
determined pre-miR-132 by qPCR for a panel of 224 precursor
miRNAs in RNAs samples from PD and normal brains. Their
results showed that pre-miR-132 was enriched and high
expressed in the midbrain of PD brains compared to HC.
Moreover, it is known that Nurr1 is expressed predominantly
in the central nervous system (CNS), especially in the
midbrain and limbic areas.20 The decline of Nurr1-immunoreactive neuronal number and optical density have been
observed in the SN neurons of PD midbrain.35 In addition

scores 1−2). We considered that the expression level of miR132 were also aﬀected by other factors, such as gender,
duration and severity of disease in addition of medications.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that
the areas under the ROC curve (AUC) were 0.72 (95% CI,
0.66−0.78; p < 0.0001) for miR-132 in plasma between PD
and HC. The AUC of miR-132 were larger than 0.7, which
means that miR-132 could be considered to have a
discriminative value. Certainly, a larger population-based
study is needed for the validation of this observation.
To further explore how miR-132 worked in the occurrence
and development of PD, we measured the PBL expression level
of Nurr1, which has been reported to be a target gene of miR132.25 We previously found that Nurr1 gene expression was
signiﬁcantly decreased in PBL of patients with PD as compared
with both HC and NDC.26,27 Furthermore, Nurr1 mRNA level
in PBL of PD was signiﬁcantly lower than that in HC (0.007 ±
0.001 vs 0.017 ± 0.003, p < 0.001), and NDC (0.007 ± 0.001
vs 0.017 ± 0.002, p < 0.001). There was no diﬀerence of Nurr1
expression between HC and NDC (Figure 4A), which was in

Figure 5. Correlation between plasma miR-132 and PBL Nurr1 levels in the peripheral blood of HC (n = 98), PD (n = 142), and NDC (n = 105).
Spearman correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between the relative expression of miR-132 and Nurr1. (A) HC group: r = −0.335, p

to the biological eﬀects on CNS, Nurr1 has been reported to
be associated with pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in peripheral
blood mononuclear cell including PBL in patients with PD and
type 2 diabetes.36,37 Here, we measured Nurr1 expression in
PBL and analyzed the correlation between PBL Nurr1 and
plasma miR-132, showing a negative correlation in PD patients
(r = −0.579, p < 0.001) (Figure 5). Interestingly, no
correlation was found in NDC patients (r = 0.082, p =
0.411) (Figure 5), suggesting that miR-132/Nurr1 signaling
was speciﬁcally involved in PD. Moreover, to explore the
correlation of miR-132 and Nurr1 in blood, we determined if
miR-132 can aﬀect the Nurr1 expression in PBL. We
transfected with miR-132 mimic or normalized control (NC)
mimic in cultured PBL for 24 h, and found that the Nurr1 level
was signiﬁcantly decreased in PBL transfected with miR-132
mimic (Figure S2), suggesting a regulative eﬀect of miR-132
on Nurr1 expression in PBL. Our previous studies and others
have documented that Nurr1 was critical not only in the
midbrain DAergic neuron diﬀerentiation and functional
maintenance, but also in regulating glia- and lymphocytemediated inﬂammation.24,36,37 Collectively, Nurr1 defect might
play an important role in PD pathogenesis.
Recently, growing evidence has shown that miR-132 may be
one of the promising miRNAs in the diagnosis and prognosis
of neurological disease. In AD, miR-132 was found to be
downregulated in patients’ brains and cerebrospinal ﬂuid,38
whereas it was upregulated in their serum39 and plasma.15
However, these reports did not compare miR-132 expression
to NDC. In this study, we found that miR-132 measurement in
plasma may help in diﬀerentiating PD from various non-PD
NDC, and the combination of Nurr1 with miR-132 may
enhance the sensitivity and speciﬁcity for diﬀerential diagnosis
of PD.
Nevertheless, the results from our present study may merit
the attention that miR-132 may be associated with PD, as
evidenced by the progressive increasing of plasma miR-132
level in PD patients in a disease stage- and disease severitydependent manner. In conclusion, our study may provide the
following information: (1) miR-132 expression level was
signiﬁcantly increased in patients with PD compared to both
HC and NDC; (2) the changes in plasma miR-132 expression
level were correlated with disease progression and severity; (3)
the diﬀerence of miR-132 level in male PD vs controls was
greater than that in female PD vs controls; (4) Nurr1 gene
expression was signiﬁcantly decreased in PBL of PD as
compared with HC and NDC, showing negative correlation
with miR-132 expression level in PD patients. Collectively, the

combined measurements of miR-132 and Nurr1 expression
levels in blood may help the diagnosis and diﬀerential
diagnosis of PD, and may also assist the monitoring of the
disease progression.

METHODS

Participants and Blood Sampling. In this study, we recruited a
total of 667 participants including 269 patients with sporadic PD, 222
HC, and 176 various non-PD NDC which consist of 38
cerebrovascular disease, 38 epilepsy, 25 peripheral neuropathy, 20
essential tremor, 16 myasthenia gravis, 15 migraine, 14 motor neuron
disease, and 10 multiple sclerosis. PD patients were examined and
diagnosed by at least two experienced neurologists from the First
Aﬃliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, according to the
Movement Disorder Society Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for
Parkinson’s disease.40 Subjects with secondary parkinsonism, neoplastic or metabolic disorders, alcoholism were excluded. PD disease
severity was assessed by Modiﬁed Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) staging.
HC group were recruited from the Health Examination Center of the
First Aﬃliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, and were either
diagnosed without a neurological disorder or with a systemic disease
without neurological manifestations. All subjects (or their caregivers)
recruited to our studies provided a written informed consent agreeing
to participate the project. This study has been granted ethical
approval by the Ethics Committee of the First Aﬃliated Hospital of
Dalian Medical University (approval number: LCKY2014-29).
Blood samples used in this study were collected by direct
venipuncture at the First Aﬃliated Hospital of Dalian Medical
University. Brieﬂy, two milliliters of peripheral blood was drawn from
cubital vein into a vacuum blood tube with ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) and then the plasma was aliquoted (200 μL) into sterile
tube and stored at −80 °C. PBL were separated from gradient Ficoll/
Paque by centrifugation at 450 g for 20 min at room temperature (20
± 2 °C), resuspended with Sample Protector of RNA/DNA
(TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction.
Plasma miRNA and PBL RNA Extraction and Quantiﬁcation.
Total miRNAs were extracted from plasma using miRNA isolation
system (Tiangen Biotech (Beijing) Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Five
microliters of miRNA from plasma was reverse transcribed into ﬁrst
strand cDNA by Tiangen miRCute miRNA cDNA synthesis kit
(Tiangen Biotech (Beijing) Co., Ltd.). Total RNAs from PBL were
extracted using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Carlsbad,
CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions, and 1 μg RNA from
PBL was reverse transcribed into ﬁrst strand cDNA by PrimeScript
RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, Dalian, China).
The plasma miR-132 and PBL Nurr1 mRNA levels were
determined by RT-qPCR. For plasma, considering the lack of suitable
internal control for normalization, artiﬁcial synthetic external miRNA
(Tiangen Biotech (Beijing) Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) was used for
normalization. Besides, the reverse primer of miR-132 was provided
by the miRcute miRNA qPCR Detection Kit (Tiangen Biotech

(Beijing) Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The up-primer targeting plasma
miR-132-3p was as follows: 5′-GCT AAC AGT CTA CAG CCA
TGG TCG-3′. For PBL, human GAPDH gene was used as an internal
control. The speciﬁc primers targeting PBL Nurr1 and GAPDH as
follows: Nurr1-forward: 5′-TCC AAC GAG GGG CTG TGC G-3′,
Nurr1-reverse: 5′-CAC TGT GCG CTT AAA GAA GC-3′; GAPDHforward: 5′-GAA GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT C-3′, GAPDH-reverse:
5′-GAA GAT GGT GAT GGG ATT TC-3′. Relative quantiﬁcation
was performed using the 2−ΔCt method. PCR was carried out using
ABI 7500 fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) in a total volume of 20 μL for each reaction.
Statistical Analysis. Quantitative data were expressed as mean ±
SEM, or median depending on the distribution of the data. The χ2 test
was used to evaluate the statistical diﬀerences of gender distribution
between PD patients and control subjects. The Kruskal−Wallis test
followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test as a post hoc test using
the GraphPad Prism software version 4 (GraphPad Inc., San Diego,
CA) was used to evaluate the diﬀerences in the age distribution and
relative miRNA expression levels in individuals from each group.
Exact 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were reported for estimation of
sensitivity and speciﬁcity. ROC analysis was performed using
MedCalc software version 17.2 (MedCalc Software Inc., Mariakerke,
Belgium), and predictive performance of the putative biomarker
(miRNA-132 or Nurr1 or both) for the presence of PD was quantiﬁed
by using AUC. Correlations were assessed using Spearman’s
correlation coeﬃcient. The correlations were reported at á level of
0.05. The other statistical analysis in this research was performed with
the SPSS software version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). All statistical
checks were carried out two-sided and a p-value < 0.05 was
considered as statistical signiﬁcance.
