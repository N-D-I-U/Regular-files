ABSTRACT

Methods for treating Parkinson's disease (PD) are provided.
Recombinant adeno-associated virus (ra AV) virions are

used to deliver genes encoding dopamine-Synthesizing
enzymes to the central nervous System of a primate. Once
delivered, the genes are expressed, which then results in
dopamine Synthesis and amelioration in the clinical signs
and symptoms of PD. The methods of the present invention
can be used to deliver the three central dopamine Synthe
sizing enzymes: tyrosine hydroxylase, aromatic L-amino
acid decarboxylase, and guanosine triphosphate cyclohydro
lase I thereby enhancing dopamine biosynthesis and provid
ing for enhanced therapeutic efficacy.

progresses, a majority of patients experience a reduction in

AADC content in affected regions of the brain (i.e., the
Substantia nigra). Since AADC converts L-dopa to dopam

ine, escalating doses of L-dopa are required for therapeutic
efficacy, but this often results in increased side effects.
Moreover, as the Substantia nigra progressively deteriorates,
AADC depletion continues unabated, often reaching a level
where therapeutic benefit derived from administration of
L-dopa is no longer realized.
0006. In view of the limitations of current systemic
therapies, gene delivery is a promising method for the
treatment for CNS disorders Such as PD. A number of viral

based Systems for gene transfer purposes have been
described, including Systems based on retroviruses and

S119(e)(1).
FIELD OF THE INVENTION

0002 The present invention relates generally to efficient
delivery of viral vectors to the CNS. More particularly, the
present invention relates to gene therapy for the treatment of
central nervous System disorders, particularly those disor
ders that involve the neurotransmitter dopamine.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

0003 Central nervous system (CNS) disorders are major
public health issues. For example, Parkinson's disease (PD),

the Second most common neurodegenerative disease in the
United States, affects over 1 million people while imposing
an annual cost to the U.S. economy of 5.9 billion dollars.
Clinically, PD is characterized by, among other Signs, a
decrease in Spontaneous movements, gait difficulty, postural
instability, rigidity, and tremor; these clinical Signs are a
direct result of the degeneration of the pigmented neurons

(i.e., dopaminergic neurons) in the Substantia nigra of the

basal ganglia region of the brain. The progressive degen
eration of the Substantia nigra leads to decreased availability
of dopamine, as the pigmented neurons of the Substantia
nigra are the Sites of Synthesis of this important catechola
mine neurotransmitter.

0004 Dopamine is synthesized in the terminal nerve
endings of the dopaminergic neurons of the Substantia nigra,
Specifically the Substantia nigra parS compacta. The dopam
inergic nerves project into the corpus striatum, Specifically
innervating the putamen and the caudate nucleus. Three
enzymes are necessary for the efficient biosynthesis of

dopamine: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), guanosine triphos
phate cyclohydrolase I (GCH), and aromatic L-amino acid
decarboxylase (AADC). Tyrosine hydroxylase adds a
hydroxyl group to the amino acid tyrosine creating L-dihy

droxyphenylalanine (L-dopa). The enzymatic activity of TH
requires the necessary cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH),

GCH catalyzing the first and rate-limiting step of the bio
synthesis of BH. Lastly, AADC removes the terminal
carboxyl group of L-dopa, which results in the formation of
dopamine.
0005. Currently, many CNS disorders such as PD are
treated by Systemic administration of a therapeutic agent.
Systemic administration, however, can be ineffective
because of a drugs inability to pass through the blood-brain
barrier and/or because of the potential for deleterious Side
effects. Thus, many potentially useful compounds, Such as
proteins, cannot be administered Systemically. Treatment of
PD currently involves oral administration of L-dopa, often
in combination with a peripheral inhibitor of AADC. ASPD

adenoviruses.

0007 Adeno-associated virus (AAV) systems are emerg

ing as the leading candidates for use in gene therapy. AAV
is a helper-dependent DNA parvovirus that requires infec
tion with an unrelated virus Such as adenovirus, a herpes
Virus or vaccinia, in order for a productive infection to occur.
The helper virus Supplies accessory functions that are nec
essary for most Steps in AAV replication.
0008 AAV infects a broad range of organisms as well as
tissue types, without eliciting the cytotoxic effects and
adverse immune reactions in animal models that have been

observed with other viral vectors (see, e.g., Muzyczka,
(1992) Current Topics in Microbiol. and Immunol. 158:97

et al. (1996) Gene Therapy 3:137-144; Brynes et al. (1996)
J. Neurosci. 16:3045-3055). Because it can transduce non
dividing tissue, AAV may be well adapted for delivering
genes to the central nervous system (CNS); indeed, AAV
vectors containing therapeutic genes have been shown to

transduce mammalian brain (see, e.g., During et al., (1998)
Gene Therapy 5:820–827; Mandel et al. (1998).J. Neurosci.
18:4271-4284).
0009 AAV vector delivery of dopamine-synthesizing
enzymes to mammalian brain tissue has been described.

Using a single gene approach, Kaplitt et al. (1994) Nature
Genetics 8:148-153) stereotaxically injected recombinant

AAV virions containing the gene coding for human tyrosine

hydroxylase (ra AV-TH) to the denervated striatum of 6-hy
droxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. Both neurons and

glial cells were transduced. Delivery of ra AV-TH to mon
key striatum resulted in expression of TH for up to 2.5

months (During et al., Supra). Bankiewicz et al. demon

Press, New York) pp. 263-266).
0012. As discussed above, the dopaminergic neurons of
the Substantia nigra are depleted over time in patients with
PD, greatly reducing dopamine Synthesis and delivery to the
corpus striatum; Such a reduction culminates in the Severe
effects of advanced disease. By providing methods for the
delivery and expression of all three enzymes in the corpus
striatum of patients with PD, increased dopamine Synthesis
and hence increased therapeutic efficacy may be obtained.

Such methods are disclosed herein.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

0013 The present invention describes methods of treat
ing Parkinson's disease (PD) using recombinant adeno
associated virus (ra AV) virions comprising genes encoding
enzymes in the dopamine biosynthetic pathway. In one
embodiment, raAV virions are provided which comprise
three genes encoding enzymes in the dopamine biosynthetic
pathway. Expression of these genes results in a therapeutic
effect in a primate exhibiting Symptoms associated with
Parkinson's disease. Preferably, the primate is a human.
Specifically, the genes comprise tyrosine hydroxylase (TH),
aromatic amino L-acid decarboxylase (AADC), and gua
nosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GCH).
0.014. The genes comprising dopamine biosynthetic
enzymes are delivered to cells of the central nervous System
(CNS) of a primate, preferably a human. In one embodiment
cells of the corpus striatum are transduced by raAV virions.
In one aspect, cells of the putamen are transduced. In another
aspect, cells of the caudate nucleus are transduced.
0.015 Delivery of ra AV virions is by way of Surgical
procedures. In one embodiment, delivery is by way of
Stereotaxis. In another embodiment, delivery is improved by
way of using convection-enhanced delivery methods.
0016 Once delivered, the genes are expressed in cells of
the CNS resulting in a therapeutic effect to the primate
exhibiting symptoms associated with PD. In one embodi

0019. The present invention embraces the use of a recom
binant adeno-associated virus (ra AV) virion to deliver a

"heterologous gene' encoding one or more enzymes
involved in the biosynthesis of dopamine to the brain of a
mammalian Subject. A “recombinant AAV virion” or “r AAV
Virion' is an infectious virus composed of an AAV protein

shell (i.e., a capsid) encapsulating an “raAV vector, the

rAAV vector comprising the heterologous gene and one or

more AAV inverted terminal repeats (ITRS). AAV vectors

can be constructed using recombinant techniques that are
known in the art and include one or more heterologous genes
flanked by functional ITRs. The ITRs of the rAAV vector
need not be the wild-type nucleotide Sequences, and may be
altered, e.g., by the insertion, deletion, or Substitution of
nucleotides, So long as the Sequences provide for proper
function, i.e., rescue, replication, and packaging of the AAV
genome.

0020. In the context of the present invention, a “recom
binant AAV virion' or “rAAV virion' is an infectious virus

composed of an AAV protein shell (i.e., a capsid) encapsu
lating a “recombinant AAV (ra AV) vector,” the rAAV vector

defined herein as comprising the HNA and one or more AAV

inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). AAV vectors can be con

Structed using recombinant techniques that are known in the
art and include one or more HNAS flanked by functional

ITRS. The ITRS of the rAAV vector need not be the

wild-type nucleotide Sequences, and may be altered, e.g., by
the insertion, deletion, or Substitution of nucleotides, So long
as the Sequences provide for proper function, i.e., rescue,
replication, and packaging of the AAV genome.
0021 Recombinant AAV virions may be produced using
a variety of techniques that are well known in the art. For
example, the skilled artisan can use wt AAV and helper
Viruses to provide the necessary replicative functions for

producing raAV virions (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,139,941,
herein incorporated by reference). Alternatively, a plasmid,
containing helper function genes, in combination with infec
tion by one of the well-known helper viruses can be used as

the Source of replicative functions (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No.

5,622,856, herein incorporated by reference; U.S. Pat. No.

5,139,941, Supra). Similarly, the skilled artisan can make use
of a plasmid, containing accessory function genes, in com

US 2002/0172664 A1

bination with infection by wt AAV to provide the necessary
replicative functions. AS is familiar to one of Skill in the art,
these three approaches, when used in combination with a
rAAV vector, are each sufficient to produce rAAV virions.
Other approaches, well known to the skilled artisan, can be
employed to produce rAAV virions.
0022. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention,

the triple transfection method (described in detail in U.S.

Pat. No. 6,001,650, the entirety of which is incorporated by

reference) is used to produce rAAV virions because this

method does not require the use of an infectious helper virus,
enabling raAV virions to be produced without any detect
able helper virus present. This is accomplished by use of
three vectors for raAV virion production: an AAV helper
function vector, an accessory function vector, and a raAV
vector. One of skill in the art will appreciate, however, that
the nucleic acid Sequences encoded by these vectors can be
provided on two or more vectors in various combinations.
AS used herein, the term “vector” includes any genetic
element, Such as a plasmid, phage, transposon, coSmid,
chromosome, artificial chromosome, Virus, Virion, etc.,

which is capable of replication when associated with the
proper control elements and which can transfer gene
Sequences between cells. Thus, the term includes cloning
and expression vehicles, as well as viral vectors.
0023 The AAV helper function vector encodes the “AAV

helper function” sequences (i.e., rep and cap), which func

tion in trans for productive AAV replication and encapsida
tion. Preferably, the AAV helper function vector Supports
efficient AAV vector production without generating any

detectable wild-type AAV virions (i.e., AAV virions con
taining functional rep and cap genes). An example of Such

herein. In the context of the present invention, exemplary
examples of heterologous genes are those that code for
enzymes in the dopamine biosynthetic pathway, namely:
aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase,
and guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I.
0026. The heterologous gene is operably linked to a

heterologous promoter (constitutive, cell-specific, or induc
ible) Such that the heterologous gene is capable of being

expressed in the patient's target cells under appropriate or
desirable conditions. Numerous examples of constitutive,
cell-specific, and inducible promoters are known in the art,
and one of skill could readily Select a promoter for a specific
intended use, e.g., the Selection of the muscle-specific skel
etal O-actin promoter or the muscle-Specific creatine kinase
promoter/enhancer for muscle cell-specific expression, the
selection of the constitutive CMV promoter for strong levels
of continuous or near-continuous expression, or the Selec
tion of the inducible ecdysone promoter for induced expres
Sion. Induced expression allows the skilled artisan to control
the amount of protein that is Synthesized. In this manner, it
is possible to vary the concentration of therapeutic product.
Other examples of well known inducible promoters are:

Steroid promoters (e.g., estrogen and androgen promoters)

and metallothionein promoters.
0027. It is often desirable to vary the concentration of a
heterologous gene product in the host cell, for example, in
order to achieve a “therapeutic effect.” As described above,
one way of accomplishing this is to make use of an inducible
promoter. Alternatively, one of Skill could vary the dose of
rAAV virions. The dose of raAV virions required to achieve
a particular therapeutic effect, e.g., the units of dose in Vector

genomes/per kilogram of body weight (vg/kg), in turn, will

a vector, pHLP19, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,001,650,
the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
0024. The accessory function vector encodes nucleotide
Sequences for non-AAV derived viral and/or cellular func

vary based on Several factors including, but not limited to:

those functions required for AAV replication, including,

other factors that are well known in the art.

tions upon which AAV is dependent for replication (i.e.,
“accessory functions'). The accessory functions include

without limitation, those moieties involved in activation of

the route of raAV virion administration, the level of heter

ologous gene expression required to achieve a therapeutic
effect, and the Stability of the heterologous gene product.
One of skill in the art can readily determine a raAV virion
dose range to treat a patient having a particular disease or
disorder based on the aforementioned factors, as well as

0028 Generally speaking, by “therapeutic effect” is
meant a level of expression of one or more heterologous

AAV gene transcription, Stage Specific AAV mRNA splicing,
AAV DNA replication, Synthesis of cap expression products,
and AAV capsid assembly. Viral-based accessory functions
can be derived from any of the known helper viruses Such as

genes Sufficient to alter a component of a disease (or
disorder) toward a desired outcome or clinical endpoint,

improvement, often reflected by the amelioration of a clini
cal sign or Symptom relating to the disease or disorder. In the
case of Parkinson's disease, a therapeutic effect can be an

adenovirus, herpesvirus (other than herpes simplex virus
type-1), and vaccinia virus. In a preferred embodiment, the
accessory function plasmid pladeno5 is used (pLadeno5 is

is hereby incorporated by reference). This plasmid provides

improvement in motor function (e.g., fine motor tasking)

a complete Set of adenovirus accessory functions for AAV
vector production, but lacks the components necessary to
form replication-competent adenovirus.
0.025 The “heterologous gene” comprises nucleic acid
Sequences joined together that are otherwise not found
together in nature, this concept defining the term "heterolo
gous.” To illustrate the point, an example of a heterologous
gene is one flanked by nucleotide Sequences not found in
asSociation with that gene in nature. Another example of a
heterologous gene is one that itself is not found in nature

manifested, for example, by improvement in manual dex
terity. Alternatively, a reduction in resting tremor can also be
a sign of amelioration of PD. There are several other
art-recognized observable and measurable endpoints to

(e.g., Synthetic Sequences having codons different from the
native gene). Allelic variation or naturally occurring muta

tional events do not give rise to heterologous genes, as used

determine therapeutic efficacy (i.e., a therapeutic effect) for
a particular treatment of Parkinson's disease.
0029. In human patients displaying clinical signs and
symptoms of PD, clinicians often rely upon the well-known

Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) to

assess the Severity of disease and also to measure the
therapeutic efficacy of a particular treatment modality.
Analogous to the UPDRS system, scientists assess PD
features in primate models of Parkinsons's disease by using

US 2002/0172664 A1

the Primate Parkinsonism Rating Scale (PPRS), which mea

Sures, among other features, fine motor tasking, resting
tremor, bradykinesia, hypokinesia, and muscular rigidity.

The PPRS system is described in Langston et al., (2000) Ann
Neurol 47:S79-89.

0030) Recombinant AAV virions are introduced into
brain of a primate so that the TH, AADC, and GCH genes
are expressed. Once these enzymes are expressed, dopamine
is Synthesized and made available to the appropriate func
tional areas of the basal ganglia. The replenishment of
dopamine to the basal ganglia results in amelioration of the
Signs and Symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease:
Such signs and Symptoms include, but are not limited to, a
decrease in Spontaneous movements, gait difficulty, postural
instability, rigidity, and tremor.
0031. The basal ganglia are groups of neurons positioned
Subcortically. They include the caudate nucleus, putamen,
and globus pallidus. The caudate nucleus and the putamen

together form the corpus striatum (or simply striatum). The

caudate and putamen are reciprocally interconnected with
the Substantia nigra, which consists of the Substantia nigra

pars compacta (SNpc) and the Substantia nigra pars reticu

lata. The SNpc is the normal site of dopamine biosynthesis;
degeneration of the SNpc is a hallmark of PD.
0032. By transducing cells of the putamen or caudate
nucleus of the corpus striatum with genes encoding enzymes
in the dopamine biosynthetic pathway, dopamine Synthesis
can be restored, thereby overcoming a functionally dimin
ished SNpc network.
0.033 Corpus striatal cells can be transduced using a
variety of techniques known in the art. For example, Ster
eotaxic injection is a common Surgical technique used by
neuroSurgeons to administer various compounds to the CNS.
Direct injection can also be employed; if using this tech
nique, anatomical maps derived from CT, PET, or MRI scans
can be used by the Surgeon to aid in Selecting the Site or Sites
of injection. Other techniques, including convection-en

hanced delivery (described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,309,
634, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), can be
employed in the methods of the present invention to deliver
rAAV virions to the CNS.

0034. The following examples are presented in order to
more fully illustrate the preferred embodiments of the inven
tion. They should in no way be construed, however, as
limiting the broad Scope of the invention.

0037 To summarize, the AAV pHLP19 helper function
vector was constructed in a Several-step process using
AAV-2 sequences derived from the AAV-2 provirus,
pSM620, GenBank Accession Numbers KO1624 and
KO1625. First, the ITRs were removed from the rep and cap
sequences. Plasmid pSM620 was digested with SmaI and
Pvull, and the 4543 bp rep-and cap-encoding SmaI fragment
was cloned into the SmaI site of puC19 to produce the
7705-bp plasmid, puCrepcap. The remaining ITR sequence
flanking the rep and cap genes was then deleted by oligo
nucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotides
145A

(5'-GCTCGGTACCCGGGCGGAGGGGTG

GAGTCG-3") and 145B (5'-TAATCATTAACTACAGC
CCGGGGATCCTCT-3"). The resulting plasmid, pUCRep
CapMutated (pUCRCM) (7559 bp) contains the entire
AAV-2 genome (AAV-2 genome, GenBank Accession Num
ber NC 001401) without any ITR sequence (4389 bp). SrfI

Sites, in part introduced by the mutagenic oligonucleotides,
flank the rep and cap genes in this construct. The AAV
Sequences correspond to AAV-2 positions 146-4,534.
0038) Second, an Eco47III restriction enzyme site was
introduced at the 3' border of p5. This Eco47III site was
introduced at the 3' end of the p5 promoter in order to
facilitate excision of the p5 promoter Sequences. To do this,

pUCRCM was mutagenized with primer P547 (5'GGTTTGAACGAGCGCTCGCCATGC-3). The resulting

7559 bp plasmid was called pUCRCM47III.
0039. Third, an assembly plasmid, called pBluntscript,
was constructed. The polylinker of pBSII SK-- was changed
by excision of the original with BSSHII and replaced with
oligonucleotides blunt 1 and 2. The resulting plasmid,
pBluntscript, is 2830 bp in length, and the new polylinker
encodes the restriction sites EcoRV, HpaI, SrfI, PmeI, and
Eco47III. The blunt 1 sequence is 5'-CGCGCCGATATCGT.
TAACGCCCGGGCGTTTAAACAGCGCTGG-3 and the

blunt 2 sequence is 5'-CGCGCCAGCGCTGTTTAAACGC
CCGGGCGTTAACGATATCGG-3.

0040 Fourth, the plasmid pH1 was constructed by ligat
ing the 4397 bp rep-and cap-encoding SmaI fragment from
pUCRCM into the SrfI site of p3luntscript, such that the
HpaI site was proximal to the rep gene. Plasmid pH1 is 7228
bp in length.
0041 Fifth, the plasmid pH 2 was constructed. Plasmid
pH 2 is identical to pH1 except that the p5 promoter of pH1
was replaced by the 5' untranslated region of pCN1909

(ATCC Accession Number 69871. Plasmid pGN1909 con
struction is described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,622,856,
herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). To accom
plish this, the 329bp AscI(blunt)-Sfil fragment encoding the
5' untranslated region from pW1909lacZ (described in detail
in U.S. Pat. No. 5,622,856, Supra) was ligated into the 6831
bp SmaI(partial)-Sfil fragment of pH1, creating pH 2. Plas

its construction is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No.

mid pH 2 is 7155 bp in length.
0042 Sixth, pH 8 was constructed. A p5 promoter was
added to the 3' end of pH 2 by insertion of the 172 bp,
SmaI-Eco47III fragment encoding the p5 promoter from
pUCRCM47III into the Eco47III site in pH 2. This fragment
was oriented Such that the direction of transcription of all
three AAV promoters are the same. This construct is 7327 bp
in length.

described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,797, herein incor

porated by reference in its entirety. To Summarize, pI adeno
1 containing adenovirus VARNA, E4 and E2a gene regions,
was assembled by cloning adenovirus type-5 genes into a
custom polylinker that was inserted between the PvulI sites
of pBSII S/k-. More particularly, a double stranded oligo
nucleotide polylinker encoding the restriction enzyme Sites

from the stable human cell line, 293 (readily available
through, e.g., ATCC under Accession Number CRL1573),
were plated in eight 10-cm tissue culture dishes at 1x10°
cells at 37 C. to reach 90% confluency over a period of from
about 24 to 48 hours prior to transfection.
0047 Transfections were carried out using the calcium
phosphate method. Specifically, at 1 to 4 hours prior to
transfection, the medium in the tissue culture plates was
replaced with fresh Dulbeco's Modified Eagles Medium

(DMEM)/F12 (GIBCO, BRL) containing 10% fetal calf

SalI-Xbal-EcoRV-Srfl-BamHI (5'-GTCGACAAATCTA
GATATCGCCCGGGCGGATCC-3) was ligated to the 2513

Serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% glutamine. A
total of 10 ug each of DNA from the three vectors, pHLP19,
pI adeno1, and raAV-TH were added to 1 mL of sterile 300
mM CaCl, which was then added to 1 mL of sterile 2x HBS

from the plM17 plasmid (the plM17 plasmid described in
detail in McGrory et al. (1988) Virology 163:614-617): the
1,724 bp Sall-HinDIII VA RNA-containing fragment (cor

assembly plasmid. The following fragments containing
adenovirus type-5 genes or gene regions were then obtained

solution (formed by mixing 280 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES
10 M NaOH) and immediately mixed by gentle inversion.

The resultant mixture was pipetted immediately into the 10

9,831 to about 11,555 of the adenovirus type-2 genome-the
complete adenovirus type-2 genome available under Gen

cm plates of 90% confluent 293 cells (in 10 mL of the
above-described culture medium) and Swirled to produce a

Bank Accession Number NC 001405); the 5,962 bp SrfI
BamHI E2a-containing fragment (corresponding to the

hours without disturbing. After transfection, the medium
was removed from the plates, and the cells washed once with

nucleotides spanning positions about 21,606 to about 27,568

of the adenovirus type-2 genome); and the 3,669 bp HphI
HinDIII E4-containing fragment (corresponding to the
nucleotides spanning positions about 32,172 to about 36,841

of the adenovirus type-2 genome). An Xbal site was added

to the HphI end of the E4-containing fragment by cloning
the 3,669 bp HphI-HinDIII fragment into the HpaI site of
cloning vector, and then excising the fragment with Xbal

and HinDIII (partial digestion). The 5.962 E2a-containing

fragment was cloned between the SrfI and BamHI sites of
the assembly plasmid, and the 1,724 bp VARNA-containing
fragment and the modified 3,669 bp E4-containing frag
ments were joined by their common HinDIII ends and
ligated between the SalI and Xbal sites of the assembly
plasmid to obtain the pladeno 1 construct.
Recombinant AAV-TH Vector Construction

004.5 The recombinant AAV-TH vector was constructed
from a parent plasmid containing the lac7 gene. The parent
plasmid was constructed as follows: A 2.7-kb Kas-Earl

fragment from puC119 (GenBank Accession Number
U07650) was blunted and ligated to a multiple cloning
Sequence containing the following restriction enzyme Sites
(5'-NotI-Mlul-SnaBI-AgeI-BstBI-BssHII-NcoI-HpaI
BspEI-PmlI-RsriI-NotI-3). The following fragments were
successively cloned into the SnaBI site, a BstBI-BstBI
fragment from the human growth hormone first intron was
inserted into the BstBI site, the lacZ gene was ligated into
the BSSHII site, and HpaI-BamHI fragment of the simian

virus 40 (SV40) polyadenylation signal sequence was

cloned into the HpaI site. The resulting Not-Not expression
cassette was inserted between the AAV 145-bp inverted
terminal repeats of a puC-based plasmid. The pTH vector
plasmid was constructed by excising the lac7 gene from the
parent vector plasmid and replacing it with the 1.8-kb human

TH (type 1) gene (GenBank Accession No. X05290).

0048. The cells were then collected, media was removed

by centrifugation (1000x g for 10 min.), and a 1 mL lysate
(cells lysed in Tris buffer-10 mM Tris 150 mM NaCl, pH
8.0) was produced using 3 freeze/thaw cycles (alternating
between dry ice-ethanol and 37 C. water baths). The lysates
were made free of debris by centrifugation (12,000x g for 10
min).
0049 Recombinant AAV-TH virions were then purified

by two Sequential continuous cesium chloridate gradient
ultracentrifugations. Recombinant AAV-TH titer was deter
mined by quantitative dot-blot hybridization of DNAse
treated recombinant AAV-TH stocks.

for the procedure. Each macaque received nine injections of
AAV virions in three tracts in the unilateral putamen. The
injection consisted of 5 u with a 1:1:1 mixture of ra AV

TH, IAAV-AADC, and raAV-GCH (at a concentration of
1x10, virion particles per mL for each vector type, i.e.,
1x10 raAV-TH virions, 1x10' raAV-AADC virions, and

1x10" raAV-GCH virions). Injections were made through a

Hamilton microSyringe at a rate of 1 u/min. The needle was
left in place for an additional five minutes to prevent the loSS
of virions by back flow. As a control, 15 lull of raAV-Lacz,

(Eicom, Kyoto, Japan). The probes were implanted in the

putamen bilaterally and Ringer's Solution was passed
through them at a rate of 10 uM/min for 20 min to remove
dopamine Overflow from the damaged tissue. The perfusion
rate was decreased to 2 u/min and maintained during the
experiment. Two hours after the insertion of the probes, 30
