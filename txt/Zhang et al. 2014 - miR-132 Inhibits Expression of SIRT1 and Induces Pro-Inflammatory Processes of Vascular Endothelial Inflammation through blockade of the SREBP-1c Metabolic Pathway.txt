Abstract
Purpose Inflammation participates centrally in all stages of
atherosclerosis (AS), which begins with pro-inflammatory
processes and inflammatory changes in the endothelium, related to lipid metabolism. MicroRNA (miRNA) inhibition of
inflammation related to SIRT1 has been shown to be a promising therapeutic approach for AS. However, the mechanism
of action is unknown.
Methods We investigated whether miRNAs regulate the
S I RT 1 an d i t s do w ns t r e a m S R E B P- l i p o ge ne s i s cholesterogenesis metabolic pathway in human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs were transfected with
miR-132 mimics and inhibitors, and then treated with or
without tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). The effects of
miR-132 on pro-inflammatory processes, proliferation and
apoptosis were assessed.
Results We identified that the relative 3’ UTR luciferase
activities of SIRT1 were significantly decreased in miR132 transfected HUVECs (0.338±0.036) compared to control (P=0.000). miR-132 inhibited SIRT1 expression of
mRNA level in HUVECs (0.53±0.06) (P<0.01) as well
as proteins of SIRT1. mRNA expression and protein levels of

SREBP (0.45±0.07), fatty acid synthase (FASN) (0.55±0.09)
and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR)
(0.62± 0.08) (P< 0.01), which are downstream regulated
genes, were reduced in HUVECs by miR-132. MiR-132
promoted pro-inflammatory processes and apoptosis of
HUVECs induced by TNF-α, and inhibited its proliferation,
viability and migration.
Conclusions SIRT1 mRNAs are direct targets of miR-132.
miR-132 controls lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis in
HUVECs by inhibiting SIRT1 and SREBP-1c expression
and their downstream regulated genes, including FASN and
HMGCR. Inhibition of SIRT1 by miR-132 was associated
with lipid metabolism-dependent pro-inflammatory processes
in HUVECs. The newly identified miRNA, miR-132 represents a novel targeting mechanism for AS therapy.

Atherosclerosis is the major cause of myocardial infarction
and stroke and thus constitutes the leading cause of mortality
in the world. Atherosclerosis is a specific form of arteriosclerosis in which an artery wall thickens as a result of the
accumulation of calcium and fatty materials such as cholesterol and triglyceride. It is a syndrome affecting arterial blood
vessels, a chronic inflammatory response in the walls of
arteries. It is caused largely by the accumulation of macrophages and white blood cells and promoted by low-density
lipoproteins (LDL, plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and
triglycerides) without adequate removal of fats and cholesterol

from the macrophages by functional high-density lipoproteins
(HDL). It is characterized by the formation of plaques within
the arteries [1].
Recent evidence has implicated involvement of microRNAs (miRNA) in regulating angiogenesis and endothelial
function [2–5].
miRNA-132 (miR132) is a highly conserved miRNA that
is induced by the neurotrophin BDNF in a CREB-dependent
manner [6, 7]. MiR-132 has also been shown to regulate
cellular excitability in cultured cells, possibly via regulation
of ion channels [8, 9]. Using primary human adipose-derived
stem cells as a source of preadipocytes and in vitro differentiated adipocytes, Strum JC et al. found that IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) are constitutively
secreted by both cell types and induced in response to serum
deprivation. MicroRNA profiling revealed the rapid induction
of miR-132 in these cells when switched to serum-free medium. Furthermore, miR-132 overexpression was sufficient to
induce nuclear factor-kappaB translocation, acetylation of
p65, and production of IL-8 and MCP-1. Inhibitors of miR132 decreased acetylated p65 and partially inhibited the production of IL-8 and MCP-1 induced by serum deprivation.
MiR-132 was shown to inhibit silent information regulator 1
(SIRT1) expression through a miR-132 binding site in the 3’untranslated region of SIRT1. Thus, in response to nutritional
availability, induction of miR-132 decreases SIRT1-mediated
deacetylation of p65 leading to activation of nuclear factorkappaB and transcription of IL-8 and MCP-1 in primary
human preadipocytes and in vitro differentiated adipocytes
[10].
SIRT1 is an NAD-dependent deacetylase that regulates
apoptosis in response to oxidative and genotoxic stress [11,
12]. Resveratrol attenuates endothelial inflammation by inducing autophagy, which was in part mediated through the
activation of the cAMP PRKA-AMPK-SIRT1 signaling pathway [13, 14]. Recent in vivo studies have suggested that Sterol
regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-1c deacetylation
by SIRT1 on Lys-289 and Lys-309 inhibits SREBP-1c activity
by decreasing its stability and its association with lipogenic
target genes [15]. SREBP-1c is a transcription factor that
controls the expression of genes related to fatty acid and
triglyceride synthesis in tissues with high lipid synthesis rates.
Targeting the aberrant SREBP-lipogenesis-cholesterogenesis
pathway may lead to new approaches to the treatment of
artherosclerosis. SIRT1 is believed to regulate vascular endothelial pro-inflammatory processes by deacetylating molecular
targets that include SREBP-1c.
MiR-132 might regulate cellular pro-inflammatory processes, proliferation, viability, migration and apoptosis
through the SIRT1-SREBP-1c pathway implicating energy
metabolism. miR-132 is progressively expressed in endothelial cells. The prediction from miRBase indicates that SIRT1 is
a potential target of miR-132 in endothelial cells. Thus, in the

present study, we aimed to investigate whether vascular endothelial pro-inflammatory processes and atherosclerosis progression is determined by a miR-132-dependent SIRT1 loss of
function.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Treatment
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from umbilical cord veins as reported previously [16]
and cultured on gelatin-coated plastic dishes (Dibco Biocult,
Uxbridge, 1–50350) with M199 medium supplemented with
10 % fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5 % CO2. All experiments were performed following 3–6 passages when the cells reached 80-90 % confluence.
During the logarithmic growth phase, cells were exposed to
TNF (10 ng/mL) for 4 h. The ethics review board at the first
Affiliated Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital approved this study, and informed consent was obtained from
all patients before participation.
Reagents
Human miRNA precursors, miRNA inhibitors, TaqMan
miRNA assay, mirVanaTM miRNA isolation kit and Lipofectamine 2,000 were purchased from Life Technologies. The
3’UTR luciferase reporter DNA constructs of SIRT1
(HmiT017704-MT05) were purchased from GeneCopoeia
(Rockville, MD). CellTiter 96H AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (mitochondrial MTS assay) and CaspaseGloH 3/7 Assay Systems were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI).
MiRNA Transfection
Transient transfection of miRNA precursors or inhibitors was
carried out using Lipofectamine 2,000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Human miR-132 (PM12827) precursors,
anti-miR-132 (MH12827) and negative control (miR-NC;
AM17110) were used for assays.
Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-polymerase
Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was prepared from cells using the RNeasy Mini kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and subjected to reverse transcription
by SuperScriptH III reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A hot start at
95 °C for 5 min was followed by 40 cycles at denaturation at
95 °C for 15 s, annealing of the primers at 58 °C for 30 s and
elongation at 72 °C for 30 s using ABI 7,500 Fast Real-Time

Cardiovasc Drugs Ther

PCR System (Life Technologies). Data were normalized to
18S rRNA or GAPDH and represented as the average fold of
three independent duplicates. To determine intrinsic miR-132
expression, miRNA was prepared from cells using the
mirVanaTM miRNA isolation kit (Life Technologies). Mature
miRNA was quantified by the TaqMan miRNA assay (Life
Technologies) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The data were normalized by RNU6B.
ELISA for sICAM1
The sICAM1 levels in the endothelial cell-conditioned medium were measured using an ELISA kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Western Blot Analysis
Cell lysates were prepared from cells using a lysis buffer
[50 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 0.02 % NaN3, 0.1 %
SDS, 1 % NP-40 and 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate] containing
1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Protein
concentration was determined by Bradford assay using
Coomassie Plus Protein Reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Western blot was performed using the Novex system
(Life Technologies).
Primary antibodies anti-SREBP-1c, FASN, HMGCR, AR,
ICAM1, MMP9 andβ-actin, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA), and secondary antibodies which were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ) were used. Detection of protein bands was
done using Enhanced Chemiluminescence Western Blotting
Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare).
Fatty Acid and Cholesterol Quantification
The amounts of long chain fatty acids and cholesterols were
determined using the Free Fatty Acid Quantification Kit and
Cholesterol/Cholesteryl Ester Detection Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) in cells. The amounts of fatty acids and cholesterols were normalized by total cell numbers. The relative fatty
acid or cholesterol (%) was assigned as 100 % in control.
Cell Proliferation, Viability and Migration Assays
Cells (6,000 cells/well) were plated on 96-well plates and
transfected with miR-132, inhibitor of miR-132 or NC. Cell
proliferation was measured 3 d post-transfection by MTS
assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) kit purchased from DOJINDO
(Japan), which was used to determine cell viability. Cells were
pretreated with above methods and then incubated in 96-well
plate for 16 h. In each well, 10 μL CCK-8 solutions was

added. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h, absorbance
values were measured with plate reader at 450 nm. In vitro
cell migration was determined in Boyden chambers precoated with collagen I (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; for
migration assay) or growth factor-depleted Matrigel matrix
(BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA; for invasion assay). Cells
(1.5×105 cells/well) were seeded into the inside of the precoated upper chambers. After incubation at 37°Cwith 5 %
CO2 for 48 h, the numbers of migrating cells were measured
by a crystal violet staining method.
Apoptosis Assays
For Annexin V staining, a fluorescence-activated prostate
cancer cell sorting analysis was done 72 h post-transfection
of miRNAs using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection
Kit I (BD Bioscience) and a FACScan flow cytometer with
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln
Park, NJ). For the caspase activity assay, cells were measured
for caspase 3/7 enzymatic activities by Caspase-GloH 3/7
Assay Systems (Promega). Data were normalized by total
proteins.
Statistics
Continuous normally distributed variables were represented graphically as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
For statistical comparison of quantitative data between
groups, analysis of variance (ANOVA) or t-test was
performed. To determine differences between groups
not normally distributed, medians were compared using
Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA. χ2 test was used when necessary for qualitative data. The degree of association
between variables was assessed using Spearman’s nonparametric correlation. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS software version 13.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Probabilities of 0.05 or less were
considered to be statistically significant.

MiR-132 Inhibits Expression of SIRT1, SREBP1-c
and their Downstream Genes in HUVECs
To investigate whether miRNAs regulate the SIRT1 and its
downstream SREBP-lipogenesis-cholesterogenesis metabolic

one or more miRNAs target SIRT1, the key factor that
regulates fatty acid, lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis and
homeostasis. The miRNAs, miR-132, were retrieved which

that SIRT1 mRNAs are direct targets of miR-132. To validate

mRNA Expression of SREBP (0.45±0.07), FASN (0.55±
0.09) and HMGCR (0.62±0.08) [17, 18], which are downstream regulated genes, were reduced in HUVECs by miR132 (Fig. 1c). Their protein levels were inhibited too (Fig. 1d).
Because SREBP1c, FASN and HMGCR are important enzymes for de novo synthesis of fatty acid and cholesterol
respectively, we subsequently examined the levels of fatty
acid and cholesterol in cells.

Pro-Inflammatory Processes-Promoting Activity
of miR-132 in HUVECs Related to SIRT1
and SREBP-Lipogenesis-Cholesterogenesis

TNFα for 4 h significantly increased the expression of
ICAM1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and MMP9
[matrix metallopeptidase 9 (gelatinase B, 92 kDa
gelatinase, 92 kDa type IV collagenase)] (Fig. 2a) as
well as the soluble ICAM (sICAM1) level (Fig. 2b) in
endothelial cells (Fig. 2b: control: 0.38±0.04; 5 ng/mL
0.62±0.11; 10 ng/mL 0.87±0.09; 50 ng/mL 0.93±0.14).
As expected, TNFα induced sICAM1 levels as well as
the expression of ICAM1 and MMP9 in HUVECs.
To determine whether inflammation could be promoted by
miR-132 in HUVECs, we investigated cells pretreated with
miR-132 or its inhibitor for 48 h, and then followed by
treatment with or without TNFα 10 (10 ng/mL) for an additional 24 h. The results showed that miR-132 induced
sICAM1 level as well as the expression of ICAM1 and
MMP9 in HUVECs (Fig. 3a and b). Moreover, the sICAM1
level as well as the expression of ICAM1 induced by miR-132
and/or TNFα could be prohibited significantly by inhibitors of
miR-132 (Fig. 3b: c vs. e, P<0.01; d vs. f, P<0.01)
(Fig. 3b: a, 0.38±0.04; b, 0.87±0.09; c, 1.33±0.18; d,
1.54±0.14; e, 0.18±0.03; f, 0.56±0.04).

To further test the specificity of miR-132 for SREBPlipogenesis-cholesterogenesis, antisense oligonucleotides
against miR-132 were used as miR-132 inhibitors. By
blocking endogenous miR-132 in HUVECs with or
without pro-inflammatory processes, miR-132 inhibitors
increased SIRT1, SREBP-1c and their downstream gene
expression (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the
amounts of intracellular fatty acid and cholesterol were
significantly decreased in miR-132-transfected HUVECs
compared with the control groups. These results suggest
that miR-132 inhibited pro-inflammatory processes related to SIRT1-SREBP signaling through reduction of
SIRT1 expression and decreased the levels of fatty acid
and cholesterol in HUVECs. Conversely, by blocking
miR-132 in HUVECs, miR-132 inhibitors increased the
amounts of intracellular fatty acid (Fig. 5a) and cholesterol (Fig. 5b).

MiR-132 Suppress Cell Proliferation, Viability and Migration
in HUVECs
To assess the potential for biological consequences elicited by
miR-132, we re-expressed and downloaded miR-132 in
HUVECs and performed a series of functional assays relevant
to cell function. When HUVECs were transfected with miR132, proliferation of both cell types was inhibited in comparison with control cells (Fig. 6a). MiR-132 also significantly
inhibited in vitro viability (Fig. 6b) and migration (Fig. 6c) in
HUVECs. Conversely, by over-expressing miR-132 in
HUVECs, miR-132 inhibitors increased cell proliferation,
viability and migration (Fig. 6). These data suggest that
miR-132 suppress pathways relevant to cell viability and
migration.
Apoptotic Death in HUVECs
To determine if miR-132 induce apoptosis in HUVECs,
Annexin V-FITC/7-AAD staining measurements and caspase
activity assays were carried out. The results of Annexin
VmiR-FITC/7-AAD staining and flow cytometric analysis
revealed that miR-132 increased the apoptotic cell fractions
(both early and late apoptotic cell fractions, P<0.05) in
HUVECs compared with the control groups, especially in
groups treated with TNFα (Fig. 7a, P<0.05). Caspase 3/7
activities were also significantly induced by miR-132 in
HUVECs (Fig. 7b, P<0.01) These results suggest that miR132 induces HUVECs death through activation of a caspasedependent apoptotic mechanism.

Discussion
In this study, we identified one miRNA that plays an important
role in the regulation of lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis in
HUVECs. MiRNAs have been reported to regulate multiple
important biological processes including metabolism [19] and
are potentially of use in AS therapy [20]. However, how
miRNAs mediate aberrant fat metabolism and homeostasis in
HUVECs remains unclear. We found that miR-132 inhibited
fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis through down-regulation
of SIRT1 and key lipogenic or cholesterogenic transcription
factors, SREBP-1c, and their downstream regulated genes including FASN and HMGCR. The inhibitor of miR-132 could
induce a reversed phenomenon.
SREBP-1 controls genes involved in fatty acid, lipid and
cholesterol biosynthesis [21–23], dysregulation of SREBPs
and their downstream targeted genes associated with lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis has been implicated in cancer.
Examples include FASN, a metabolic oncogene [24], and

Fig. 7 MiR-132 induces apoptotic death of HUVECs. An Annexin VFITC/7-AAD staining apoptotic assay and flow cytometry were performed in HUVECs. MiR-132 increased the apoptotic cell fractions (both
early and late apoptotic cell fractions; P<0.01) compared with the control
groups (a). Caspase 3/7 activities were significantly increased by miR132 in HUVECs (b). Caspase 3/7 activities (fold) were assigned as 1.0 in
non-treated cells. The data are presented as mean±SD from three independent experiments. *P<0.05, **P<0.01

HMGCR, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis; both proteins have been reported to be involved in the
development and progression of cancer [25, 26]. Since
SREBP transcription factors have been shown to be
disregulated both in endothelial dysfunction and metabolic disorders [27], targeting the aberrant SREBPlipogenesis-cholesterogenesis pathway may lead to new
approaches to the treatment of AS. Our results showed that
SIRT1 mRNAs are direct targets of miR-132. MiR-132 controls
lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis in HUVECs by inhibiting
SIRT1 and SREBP-1c expression and downregulating their
targeted genes, including FASN and HMGCR. Inhibition of
SIRT1 by miR-132 was associated with lipid metabolismdependent pro-inflammatory processes in HUVECs. The newly
identified miRNA, miR-132 represents a novel targeting mechanism for AS therapy.
Accumulating evidence indicates that AS is the result of a
prolonged and excessive inflammatory process in the vascular
wall, which often begins with inflammatory changes in the

Cardiovasc Drugs Ther

endothelium, characterized by the expression of SIRT1,
SREBP-1c and their downstream molecules [28]. Pharmacological and dietary strategies have targeted these disorders to
control AS, and some natural food products may be candidates for the control or prevention of AS [29].
TNFα may induce sICAM1 levels as well as the expression
of ICAM1 and MMP9 in HUVECs. To determine whether
pro-inflammatory processes could be promoted by miR-132
in HUVECs, we investigated cells which were pretreated with
miR-132 or its inhibitor for 48 h, and then followed by
treatment with or without TNFα. Our results showed that
miR-132 induced sICAM1 level as well as the expression of
ICAM1 and MMP9 in HUVECs . Moreover, the induction of
sICAM1 as well as the expression of ICAM1 induced by miR132 and/or TNFα could be prohibited significantly by the
inhibitor of miR-132 .
To further test the specificity of miR-132 for SREBPlipogenesis-cholesterogenesis, antisense oligonucleotides
against miR-132 were used as miR-132 inhibitors. By
blocking endogenous miR-132 in HUVECs with or without
pro-inflammatory processes, miR-132 inhibitors increased
SIRT1, SREBP-1c and their downstream gene expression.
As shown in Fig. 5, the amounts of intracellular fatty acid
and cholesterol were significantly decreased in miR-132transfected HUVECs compared with the control groups. These results suggest that miR-132 inhibited pro-inflammatory
processes related to SIRT1-SREBP signaling through reduction of SIRT1 expression and decreased the levels of fatty acid
and cholesterol in HUVECs. Conversely, by blocking miR132 in HUVECs, miR-132 inhibitors increased the amounts of
intracellular fatty acid and cholesterol.
Zhang et al. have shown that endothelial SIRT1 is an antiatherosclerosis factor [30.] The possible underlying mechanism may be related to inhibition of oxLDL-induced apoptosis, upregulation of eNOS expression, and improvement of
endothelial relaxation. Together with recent studies revealing
that SIRT1 mediates the life span effect of calorie restriction
and that calorie restriction may decrease atherosclerosis
[31–34], this suggest that SIRT1 may, although as yet speculative, be an underlying mediator of calorie restriction’s
atheroprotective effect and that SIRT1 may be a useful target
for atherosclerosis prevention and treatment [30]. In our
study, we found that miR-132 controls lipogenesis and
cholesterogenesis in HUVECs by inhibiting SIRT1 and
SREBP-1c expression and downregulating their targeted
genes, including FASN and HMGCR. Inhibition of SIRT1
by miR-132 was associated with lipid metabolism-dependent
pro-inflammatory processes in HUVECs.
Because of its documented ability to regulate cellular characteristics in an activity dependent manner [35], a role for
miR132 in energy metabolism in HUVECs was investigated.
MiR-132 reduced cell proliferation, viability and migration,
and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in HUVECs. These

data suggest that miR-132 plays a role in promoting proinflammatory processes by inhibiting SIRT1 and SREBP-1c
expression, and thereby reprogramming lipogenesis and
cholesterogenesis.
In summary, our study demonstrates that miR-132 inhibits
the expression of SIRT1 and SREBP-1c as well as their
downstream regulated genes, and reprograms lipogenesis
and cholesterogenesis in HUVECs. Additional studies are
warranted to define the regulatory mechanisms involving
miR-132 in HUVECs. Down-expression of miR-132 suppresses proliferation of HUVECs and induces apoptotic cell
death in vitro. It suggests that miR-132 may promote atherosclerosis. Taken together, miR-132 directly or indirectly regulates a cohort of genes with significant biological roles in
lipid and cholesterol anabolism and homeostasis, cell proliferation and apoptosis progression in HUVECs. This small,
non-coding RNA therefore provides a potential therapeutic
target for treatment of atherosclerosis.
