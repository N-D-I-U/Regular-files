Summary
Nine human neurodegenerative diseases are due to
expansion of a CAG repeat- encoding glutamine within
the open reading frame of the respective genes. Polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion confers dominant toxicity, resulting in neuronal degeneration. MicroRNAs
(miRNAs) have been shown to modulate programmed
cell death during development. To address whether
miRNA pathways play a role in neurodegeneration,
we tested whether genes critical for miRNA processing modulated toxicity induced by the spinocerebellar
ataxia type 3 (SCA3) protein. These studies revealed
a striking enhancement of polyQ toxicity upon reduction of miRNA processing in Drosophila and human
cells. In parallel genetic screens, we identified the
miRNA bantam (ban) as a potent modulator of both
polyQ and tau toxicity in flies. Our studies suggest
that ban functions downstream of toxicity of the
SCA3 protein, to prevent degeneration. These findings
indicate that miRNA pathways dramatically modulate
polyQ- and tau-induced neurodegeneration, providing
the foundation for new insight into therapeutics.
Introduction
Human polyQ diseases are due to the expansion of
a CAG repeat within the open reading frame of the respective genes (Zoghbi and Orr, 2000). The polyQ expansion confers dominant toxicity, resulting in progressive
neuronal dysfunction and loss. In such diseases, the
pathogenic protein accumulates, typically in nuclear inclusions. Although it is unclear how these accumulations
contribute to disease pathogenesis, several lines of evidence support the idea that a conformational change
occurs in the disease protein associated with reduced
solubility, enhanced oligomerization, and toxicity (Muchowski and Wacker, 2005). Studies with animal models
and patient tissue indicate that the protein accumulations contain chaperones and components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, suggesting that the toxic,
misfolded protein triggers a stress response to lower
the amount of disease protein. A number of suppressors
of neurodegeneration in animal models have coupled
reduced protein accumulation, or modulation of ability to
handle misfolded protein, to mitigation of degeneration
(Bilen and Bonini, 2005).

Short Article

Although modifiers that implicate protein misfolding
pathways have been defined, cellular pathways that
link polyQ toxicity and degeneration of the cell are less
clear. Morphological analysis of degenerating neurons
reveals that they appear to undergo condensation of
the nucleus and cytoplasm; however, other hallmarks
of programmed cell death, such as apoptotic bodies
and fragmentation of nuclear DNA are not observed
(Jackson et al., 1998; Turmaine et al., 2000). Studies in
Drosophila have shown that the baculoviral protein
P35, which potently inhibits caspase activity, is largely
ineffective at mitigating polyQ-induced degeneration
(Jackson et al., 1998; Warrick et al., 1998). Autophagy,
which couples reduced protein accumulation with cell
survival, is thought to be involved, as are dApaf-1/Dark
activities for the Huntington’s disease protein (Ravikumar et al., 2004; Sang et al., 2005).
miRNA pathways have been implicated in developmental apoptosis, normal developmental processes,
and cancer (Ambros, 2004; Bartel, 2004; Caldas and
Brenton, 2005). In Drosophila, the miRNAs ban, mir-14,
and select other miRNAs have been shown to modulate
programmed cell-death genes (Brennecke et al., 2003;
Leaman et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2003). SCA3 is one of
the polyQ diseases and is among the most common
dominantly inherited ataxias (Zoghbi and Orr, 2000). To
address a possible role for miRNAs in neuronal maintenance, we tested whether compromising miRNA processing modulated polyQ pathogenesis. Our findings
extend the processes modulated by miRNAs to human
neurodegenerative diseases.
Results
Reduced miRNA Processing Dramatically Enhances
Ataxin-3- and tau-Induced Neurodegeneration
in Drosophila
We tested whether miRNAs modulated polyQ pathogenesis in Drosophila by downregulating miRNA processing
with the dicer mutation and then determining the effect
on Ataxin-3-induced neurodegeneration. Dicer activity
is essential for miRNA processing in flies and vertebrates (Bernstein et al., 2001; Hutvagner et al., 2001).
Drosophila has two dicer genes: dicer-1 (dcr-1) is critical
for maturation of miRNAs, whereas dcr-2 modulates
generation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Lee
et al., 2004). Flies were generated that expressed the
pathogenic polyQ protein and were also mutant for
dcr-1 activity in the eye.
Expression of truncated pathogenic Ataxin-3 induces
degeneration, which is characterized by partial loss of
pigmentation and retinal structure (Figure 1A; Warrick
et al., 1998). dcr-1 mutation dramatically enhanced degeneration due to the pathogenic protein, such that
the eye was now severely degenerate with complete
loss of pigmentation (Figure 1B). Because loss of dcr-1
alone affects eye morphology (Figure 1C; Lee et al.,
2004), we also examined the effects of a second gene
critical for miRNA maturation, R3D1/loquacious. R3D1
is a dsRNA binding protein that is required for the

activity of Dcr-1 in miRNA processing (Forstemann et al.,
2005; Jiang et al., 2005). We confirmed that flies homozygous for the hypomorphic allele R3D1f00791 had reduced miRNA processing and that R3D1 mutation had
no effect on transcription from the Gal4-UAS system
(Figures S1A and S1B in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Loss of R3D1 alone had
minimal effects on the eye (Figure 1G). However, reduction of R3D1 activity dramatically enhanced SCA3trQ78-induced neural degeneration (Figures 1D and 1E).
This confirmed that miRNA pathways normally play
a protective role in polyQ-induced neurodegeneration.
We considered whether reduction of miRNA processing enhanced SCA3 pathogenesis through the same
type of degeneration pathways that normally occur
upon pathogenic polyQ protein expression or whether
reduction of miRNA processing modulated programmed cell death, which then enhanced the phenotype. To address this, we determined whether we could
detect features of programmed cell death when expressing the disease protein alone or upon enhanced
degeneration. TUNEL assays and western immunoblots
for activated caspase failed to reveal an effect in polyQ
pathology or with reduced R3D1 activity, and coexpression of the baculoviral anticaspase protein P35 had minimal effect (Figure S2). These data support the idea that
reduction of miRNA activity enhances degeneration by
modulating pathways that normally contribute to polyQ
toxicity.
To further test the specificity of miRNA pathways in
neurodegeneration, we determined whether reduction
of siRNA activity affects polyQ toxicity. In contrast to
loss of dcr-1 and reduction of R3D1, loss of dcr-2, which

reduces siRNAs, had little or no effect on polyQ-induced
neurodegeneration (Figures 1D and 1F). These data indicated that siRNA-dependent pathways do not modulate
polyQ toxicity; rather, protective activity appears specific to miRNA-dependent pathways.
We then addressed the broader role of miRNA pathways in neurodegeneration. We first determined that
reduction of R3D1 activity enhanced not only pathogenicity of truncated forms of Ataxin-3 but also of
the full-length pathogenic protein (Figures 1H–1J). To
extend these findings beyond polyQ disease, we then
examined the effect on tau. Abnormal tau accumulation
is associated with Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemperal dementia (Lee et al., 2001). In Drosophila, expression of normal or pathogenic tau induces severe neurodegeneration, reflected by a severely disrupted eye
phenotype (Figures 1K and 1M; Wittmann et al., 2001).
Reduction of R3D1 activity dramatically enhanced tau
toxicity (Figures 1L and 1N). These data indicate that
the miRNA pathway not only modulates polyQ toxicity
but also toxicity of other proteins associated with human neurodegenerative disease.
Blocking miRNA Processing Dramatically Enhances
Ataxin-3 Toxicity in Human Cells
Given these observations in flies, we addressed whether
these findings extended to human cells. To do this, we
expressed normal and pathogenic full-length Ataxin-3
protein in human HeLa cells in culture, in the presence
of normal or reduced Dicer activity. HeLa cells were
treated with siRNA directed to the dicer sequence; this
treatment lowered dicer activity, as shown by reduced
expression and processing of endogenous Dicer targets

(Figures S1C and S1D). Reduction of Dicer had no effect
on cells expressing a control protein (GFP) or on cells
expressing wild-type Ataxin-3 (At3-Q29-GFP) over the
time course of the studies (Figures 2A and 2B). This is
similar to previous studies showing that reduction of
Dicer in vertebrate cells in culture has minimal effects
over short time frames (Fukagawa et al., 2004).
We then examined the effect of reducing Dicer activity
in the presence of pathogenic Ataxin-3. These studies
revealed dramatically enhanced cell loss due to pathogenic Ataxin-3 when Dicer activity is reduced: whereas
normally, after 24 hr, there was only a modest effect of
the pathogenic protein on cell viability, with loss of dicer,
70%–80% of the cells were dead (Figures 2C–2E). The
enhancement was specific to dicer siRNA treatment,
as treatment with a control siRNA of random sequence
had no effect (Figure 2E). We confirmed that reduction
of Dicer had no effect on expression level of the transgenes or Ataxin-3 protein (Figure S1E). Moreover, the
enhanced cell loss was mitigated upon transfecting cells
with the purified small RNA fraction that contains total
HeLa cell miRNAs (Figure 2F). Taken together, these
studies demonstrated a striking effect of compromising
miRNA processing on cell loss induced by pathogenic
polyQ protein in Drosophila in vivo and in human cells.
The ban miRNA Suppresses SCA3 Degeneration
In parallel to these studies, we performed an overexpression EP screen for modifiers of the degenerative
eye phenotype of flies expressing pathogenic human
Ataxin-3 protein. We then tested if any of these modifiers
also affected other biological processes, to define additional activities of the modifier genes. Among the identified modifiers, several also affected Hid-induced programmed cell death. Genetic analysis indicated that
five of these modifiers mapped to the same genomic
region; subsequent molecular analysis revealed these
to be upregulation alleles of the miRNA ban (Figure 3A).

Whereas, normally, strong expression of pathogenic
SCA3tr-Q78 protein induces severe degeneration, upregulation of ban strikingly suppressed external pigmentation loss and restored internal retinal structure (Figures 3B–3D). Remobilization of the EP elements from
the ban gene to generate precise excision banex alleles
reverted the suppression (Figure 3E). We also determined if various UAS-ban transgenic lines (Brennecke
et al., 2003) had the ability to modulate polyQ toxicity.
Expression of a construct bearing only a 100 bp region
containing the ban miRNA suppressed degeneration,
restoring external and internal eye structures toward
normal (UAS-banD, Figure 3F). However, a control UAS
construct, driving a 6.7 kb genomic fragment that encompassed the ban region but lacked the predicted ban
miRNA hairpin, did not suppress (UAS-banB, Figure 3G).
Further control studies confirmed that ban had no effect
on the level of UAS-transgene expression from the GAL4UAS system (Figure 4I). Taken together, these data indicate that upregulation of the ban miRNA suppresses
neurodegeneration induced by pathogenic SCA3tr-Q78.
The ban miRNA functions in growth as well as programmed cell death (Brennecke et al., 2003). We noted
that ban upregulation not only suppressed polyQ toxicity but also caused a large eye phenotype (Figure 3D). To
rule out the possibility that simply enlarging the eye can
suppress polyQ degeneration, we tested other genes
that enlarge the eye. These genes had no effect on
SCA3tr-Q78-induced neurodegeneration (Figure S3), indicating that suppression of polyQ degeneration was
specific to ban.
To further rule out developmental effects of ban, we
examined the ability of ban to suppress neurodegeneration in the adult. To do this, we used a rhodopsin1 promoter GAL4 line, which directs expression to photoreceptor neurons (PR), initiating at terminal stages of
retinal formation. When expressed in this manner, upregulation of ban alone had no effect on eye structure, cell

proliferation, or growth but still strikingly mitigated
SCA3-induced neural degeneration (Figure S4). These
data indicate that ban is a potent suppressor of polyQ
neurodegeneration in adult stages.
We then tested whether ban was effective at mitigating pathogenicity of other proteins associated with
human neurodegenerative disease. These studies revealed that ban mitigated degeneration induced by not
only truncated but also full-length, pathogenic forms of
Ataxin-3 (Figure S5). Moreover, upregulation of ban suppressed tau-induced degeneration (Figure S5). These
findings indicate that ban mitigates neurotoxicity induced by multiple proteins associated with human disease, including pathogenic Ataxin-3 and tau.
Loss of ban Enhances SCA3-Associated
Neurodegeneration
These studies raised the question whether the ban
miRNA normally plays a role in pathological conditions
and therefore could be one of the miRNAs that functions
to protect against polyQ toxicity, which is affected by
reduction of dcr-1 and R3D1 gene function. Because
complete loss of function of ban is lethal, we reduced
ban activity by placing hypomorphic alleles in trans
to a ban deletion line (banEP3208 or banEP3622, in trans
to banD1). Whereas these alleles upregulate ban activity
in the presence of a GAL4 driver line, in the absence of
GAL4, these alleles decrease endogenous ban function
(Hipfner et al., 2002). We then analyzed retinal degeneration of flies expressing pathogenic SCA3tr-Q78 protein
directly by the glass multiple reporter (gmr) promoter,
rather than using the GAL4-UAS system. Flies bearing
gmr-SCA3tr-Q78 were born with a slightly degenerate
internal retinal structure (Figures 3H and 3K). Reduction
of ban activity enhanced SCA3tr-Q78-induced degeneration, such that flies were now born with more severe
neuronal loss (Figures 3I–3K). These findings indicated
that not only does upregulation of ban activity mitigate

effect on dHsp70 with ban, but dHsp70 is reduced by human

Ataxin-3 toxicity but that endogenous ban activity also
normally helps protect against polyQ-induced neurodegeneration. The enhancement of degeneration upon
reduction of miRNA processing was more severe than
with reduction of ban alone (Figure S6), indicating that
miRNAs in addition to ban modulate polyQ toxicity.

The ban miRNA Suppresses Degeneration
Downstream of polyQ Protein Toxicity
To reveal further insight into the biological activity of ban
in polyQ suppression, we determined whether ban upregulation modulated the accumulation, level, or inherent
toxicity of the pathogenic polyQ protein. First, we asked
whether ban suppression was associated with a reduction in level or accumulation of the pathogenic protein
into inclusions. We used the adult-onset disease model
in these studies, where inclusion formation takes place
over days, allowing sensitive analysis of protein level
and accumulation. When expressed in this manner, the
pathogenic protein was initially diffuse at 1 day but then
accumulated into nuclear inclusions over 7 days (Figures 4A–4C). Upregulation of ban did not alter the level
of the pathogenic protein compared to controls, nor did
ban affect protein accumulation into inclusions—the inclusions that formed in the presence of added ban were
similar to those in the absence of added ban (Figure 4D).
In contrast, the suppressor Hsp70 decreased accumulation of the pathogenic protein into inclusions (Figure 4E).
Thus, ban suppression was not associated with a change
in the level or accumulation of the pathogenic protein.
To further address ban function, we determined
whether the cellular response to the polyQ protein, revealed by antibodies that selectively detect the stressinduced form of endogenous Hsp70 (dHsp70), was
altered upon upregulation of ban. Both immunohistochemistry and western immunoblot analysis indicated
that the endogenous stress response was not altered
by ban (Figures 4F–4H and 4J). We also tested the reactivity of the polyQ protein to a monoclonal antibody
(3B5H10) that detects pathogenic forms of polyQ protein (Brooks et al., 2004). This analysis revealed similar
immunoreactivity in control flies compared to those
with degeneration suppressed by ban (Figure 4I). These
data suggest that ban modulates cellular pathogenicity
downstream of protein accumulation and inherent protein toxicity.
As noted, ban upregulation suppresses Hid-induced
cell death (Brennecke et al., 2003). Thus, one possibility
was that hid was a target of ban in SCA3 degeneration.
To test this, we generated flies not only homozygous
mutant for hid but also expressing pathogenic polyQ.
Flies lacking hid showed no change in neurodegeneration (Figure S7). Further testing of other proteins of
apoptotic pathways (P35, DIAP1, DIAP2, and dApaf-1/
Dark) showed that none of these manipulations modulated SCA3 neurodegeneration (Figure S7). We also
determined that upregulation of ban does not modulate
autophagy (Table S1), which has been implicated in cell
survival in polyQ toxicity (Ravikumar et al., 2004). These
data indicate that targets of ban or other miRNAs that
modulate polyQ degeneration are distinct from hid
and other genes tested that regulate programmed cell
death pathways. Together these data suggest that ban
activity defines distinct targets that modulate neurodegeneration.
Discussion
Our study reveals a striking role for miRNA-regulated
pathways in modulation of polyQ toxicity in both flies
and human cells. Notably, reduction of genes that affect

Molecular Cell

miRNA processing, but not siRNA processing, in Drosophila modulates polyQ degeneration, underscoring
the specificity to miRNA pathways. In Drosophila, one
of these miRNAs is ban, which modulates cell survival
upon polyQ- and tau-induced neurodegeneration. Moreover, reduction of miRNA processing in human cells also
strikingly enhanced polyQ toxicity, indicating that miRNAs also play a protective role in human cells. These
data suggest that ban and potentially additional miRNAs
are involved in mitigating polyQ- and tau-induced neurodegeneration.
miRNA Pathways Modulate polyQ and tau
Neurodegeneration
Given the role of miRNAs in modulation of developmental programmed cell death, we tested whether miRNA
pathways modulated neurodegeneration. We addressed
this by reducing miRNA processing in flies and in human
cells in the presence of pathogenic polyQ protein.
In flies, loss of dcr-1 or R3D1 had striking effects to
enhance SCA3-induced neurodegeneration. In contrast,
loss of dcr-2, which is specific to siRNA pathways,
had little effect in the situation tested. These studies indicate that miRNA-regulated activities, and not siRNAregulated activities, are critical to neurodegeneration
in vivo. In human cells, reduction of dicer activity also
dramatically enhanced cell toxicity induced by pathogenic Ataxin-3. Although, in vertebrate cells in culture,
dicer activity affects both miRNA- and siRNA-regulated
activities, siRNA-dependent activities like heterochromatic silencing do not become disrupted until later time
periods (Fukagawa et al., 2004). The effect of reducing
dicer in human cells could be rescued in part by complementing the treated cells with a fraction containing
miRNAs, indicating that the enhanced cell loss was likely
due to reduction in one or more miRNAs. As miRNAs
could affect many cellular processes, we confirmed
that enhanced degeneration with polyQ is unlikely due
to sensitizing cells to programmed cell death but rather
resembles normal polyQ degeneration; identification of
miRNAs and target genes will further define the pathways involved. There are hundreds of miRNAs in humans, with a subset expressed in both human brain
and HeLa cells (Bentwich et al., 2005). Focus on these
common miRNAs, coupled with our demonstrated ability to rescue polyQ toxicity associated with dicer deprivation, promises to reveal genes with a critical role in
neuroprotection from polyQ-induced degeneration. We
also extended our findings with ban and genes of the
miRNA pathway beyond polyQ toxicity to modulation
of tau; these findings suggest a broader role for miRNA
regulated pathways in neuroprotection.
The miRNA ban Modulates polyQ Degeneration
A genetic modifier screen in Drosophila revealed that
one miRNA that functions to modulate Ataxin-3 degeneration is ban. ban is a critical regulator in that both
loss of activity and upregulation modulated degeneration. ban mitigated not only degeneration induced by
polyQ protein but also by tau, an unrelated neurodegenerative disease protein. Although ban mitigates programmed cell death through hid, our studies indicate
that hid is not involved in modulation of degeneration
induced by pathogenic Ataxin-3.

Our studies suggest that ban modulates survival of
cells to pathogenic polyQ protein downstream of protein
accumulation, cellular stress response, and inherent
protein toxicity. In the presence or absence of added
ban, the pathogenic polyQ protein was present at similar
levels and elicited a similar stress response. This indicates that ban regulates progression of degeneration
downstream of these events. Taken together, these results suggest that ban may modulate the survival of
cells. Indeed, ban may modulate cell survival in multiple
situations: after initiation of programmed cell death, as
well as in response to neurodegenerative disease proteins, including polyQ and tau. Our studies also suggest
a role for additional miRNAs, due to the stronger enhancement of polyQ degeneration upon reduction of
miRNA processing compared to reduction of ban function alone. This suggests that miRNAs in addition to ban
in Drosophila likely play a role in regulating neurodegeneration. Moreover, although loss of miRNA processing
results in an overall enhancement, specific miRNAs may
be protective, whereas others promote degeneration. It
is also possible that proteins involved in miRNA processing could themselves be targets of polyQ toxicity.
These findings expand the role of miRNA function
from programmed cell death pathways, developmental
processes, and cancer to suggest a striking role in protection from cellular degeneration associated with
human neurodegenerative disease proteins. Further
identification of the miRNAs and their targets will reveal
new insight into mechanisms and therapeutics for the
treatment of polyQ, tau-associated, and potentially
other neurodegenerative diseases.
Experimental Procedures
Drosophila Techniques
Fly lines were grown on standard cornmeal molasses agar medium
with dry yeast at 25 C. ban alleles banE515.1, banEB5-1, banB90.1, and
banB375.1 were isolated in an overexpression screen for modifiers of
SCA3tr-Q78 degeneration. Fly line EP55 (Rorth, 1996) was crossed
to a line with transposase (w; TM6, Dr/SbD2-3), and progeny males
crossed to w; gmr-GAL4 UAS-SCA3tr-Q78. Progeny with restored
pigmentation were backcrossed to w; gmr-GAL4 UAS-SCA3trQ78, then suppressor EP insertion lines were isolated and balanced.
ban excision lines (banE515.1ex and banEP3622ex) were generated by
crossing banE515.1 and banEP3622 to flies with transposase and
screening for loss of the EP w+ marker. To test interactions with
dcr-1 and dcr-2, FRT clones in the eye in polyQ disease background
were generated, using stocks ey-FLP;; FRT82B CL gmr-hid CL/TM3,
Sb and gmr-gal4 UAS-SCA3tr-Q61/CyO; FRT82B (dcr-1Q1147X or
dcr-1d102)/TM6, Tb and FRT42D gmr-hid CL/CyO; ey-gal4 UASFLP and FRT42D dcr-2L811fsX/CyO; gmr-gal4 UAS-SCA3tr-Q78/
TM6, Tb.
Mammalian Cell Culture
HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. For
dicer knockdown, siRNA duplex targeting dicer mRNA was synthesized 50 -GCUCGAAAUCUUACGCAAAUA/UAUUUGCGUAAGAUU
UCGAGC-30 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Scrambled siRNA sequence
was 50 -CGUUACCGCGGAAUACUUCGA/UCGAAGUAUUCCGCGG
UAACG-30 . Cells were transfected with 100 nM dicer siRNA duplex
with lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), followed 48 hr
later by a second round of transfections with siRNA duplex and/or
GFP or AT3-GFP or, for rescue experiments, an additional 25 nM
dicer siRNA duplex with or without 200 ng small RNA fraction
purified from HeLa cells. The number of GFP-positive cells that
stained with propidium iodide 24 hr after transfection was scored
to determine percentage cell loss. In each experiment, over 200
GFP-positive cells from randomly selected fields were scored.

miRNA Suppression of Neurodegeneration

Data are presented as the mean 6 SEM of three independent
experiments.
Histological and Immunochemical Analysis
Epon sections, cryosections, and paraffin sections of adult heads
were performed as described (Auluck et al., 2002; Chan et al.,
2000; Warrick et al., 1998). Pseudopupil analysis was performed
on flies of the indicated genotypes by using the corneal optical neutralization technique (Franceschini, 1972). Twenty eyes/genotype
were scored, and ten ommatidia/eye were counted for each of three
independent experiments, and data are presented as mean 6 SEM.
For immunochemistry, primary antibodies were: rabbit anti-HA
(Y-11, 1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rat anti-Hsp70 (7FB,
1:1000; [Velazquez and Lindquist, 1984]). Primary antibodies for
westerns were rat anti-Hsp70 (7FB, 1:2000), mouse anti-tubulin
(E7, 1:2000, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and mouse
anti-3B5H10 (1:120,000; [Brooks et al., 2004]). ImageJ analysis
(National Institutes of Health, USA) was used for comparison of protein
by western and immunohistochemistry (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).
