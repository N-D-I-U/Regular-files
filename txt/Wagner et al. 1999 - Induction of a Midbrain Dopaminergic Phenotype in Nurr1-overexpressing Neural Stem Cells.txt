The implementation of neural stem cell lines as a source material for brain tissue transplants is currently limited by the ability to induce specific neurochemical phenotypes in these cells. Here, we show
that coordinated induction of a ventral mesencephalic dopaminergic phenotype in an immortalized multipotent neural stem cell line can be achieved in vitro. This process requires both the overexpression of the
nuclear receptor Nurr1 and factors derived from local type 1 astrocytes. Over 80% of cells obtained by
this method demonstrate a phenotype indistinguishable from that of endogenous dopaminergic neurons.
Moreover, this procedure yields an unlimited number of cells that can engraft in vivo and that may constitute a useful source material for neuronal replacement in Parkinson’s disease.

Functional replacement of specific neuronal populations through
transplantation of neural tissue represents an attractive therapeutic
strategy for treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s
disease1. Recent advances in neural stem cell biology have shown that
multipotent neural progenitors can be isolated, expanded, and used
as source material for brain transplants1–8. However, although multiple studies demonstrate that implanted neural progenitors successfully engraft and assume legitimate neural phenotypes, when transplanted in the intact adult brain these cells seem biased toward
astroglial and oligodendroglial fates6,7,9. Given that most neurodegenerative diseases affect neuronal populations of a specific neurochemical phenotype, an ideal source material for transplantation
would be an expandable cell that could be instructed to completely
assume the desired neuronal phenotype upon differentiation.
Indeed, this strategy would circumvent ethical and practical issues
surrounding the use of human fetal tissue for transplantation.
However, the complete and coordinated induction of a specific neuronal phenotype in multipotent neural precursors in vitro has
proved elusive. Our goal in this study was to define the factors
required by neural stem cells to produce a dopaminergic phenotype,
the major cell type lost in human Parkinson’s disease.
One such factor may be Nurr1, a transcription factor of the thyroid hormone/retinoic acid nuclear receptor superfamily. Nurr1 is
specifically required for the induction of midbrain dopamine neurons, which fail to develop in Nurr1-null mutant mice10–12. It is
unclear, however, whether Nurr1 is also sufficient to specify this neurochemical phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we stably overexpressed Nurr1 in a clone of multipotent neural stem cells, which do
not normally give rise to dopaminergic neurons in vitro. Thus, any
induction of dopaminergic phenotype by Nurr1 could be attributed
to an inductive process and not to a modulatory role of Nurr1 on an

ongoing developmental program. For our studies, we chose a neural
stem cell line termed C17.2 (ref. 2), which was initially derived from
developing mouse cerebellum. These cells contain a lacZ reporter,
possess the ability to differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and
oligodendrocytes in vitro and in vivo, and upon transplantation into
the developing brain, adopt regionally appropriate neuronal phenotypes2,13. Moreover, the same single factors that direct the differentiation of primary stem cells from the fetal and adult central nervous
system14 direct the differentiation of C17.2 cells in vitro, suggesting
that C17.2 neural stem cells fulfil all necessary criteria to identify the
factors sufficient to reconstitute dopaminergic neuron development
in vitro and to generate a renewable source material for transplantation.
Results and discussion
Properties of Nurr1 transfected C17.2 cells. C17.2 cells were stably
transfected, and 50 Nurr1 clones were analyzed for transgene expression by RNase protection assay (RPA; Fig. 1A). Several Nurr1 clones
overexpressed the transgene, of which the five highest expressors
were chosen for analysis, along with eight randomly chosen, mock
control clones. All Nurr1 clones behaved similarly to the parental
and mock clones in serum-containing media, with no obvious differences in growth rate or morphology. To define differentiative
capacity and phenotypic fate of Nurr1 clones, we examined their
behavior after low-density passage into serum-free defined media
(SFM). In this condition, the parental cell line begins to differentiate,
so that after 4–5 days in vitro (DIV), 80–85% of the population is
postmitotic—that is, 5-bromodeoxyuridine-negative (BrdU-) after
extended pulse—with approximately 20–30% of the postmitotic
cells adopting a neuronal fate, judged by the expression of b-tubulin
III (TuJ1+, Fig. 1B). The effects of Nurr1 on the fate of postmitotic

cells were clear and robust (Fig. 1C). In four of five Nurr1 clones, the
vast majority of postmitotic cells adopted a neuronal fate, a phenomenon not seen in any of the mock clones. However, although
Nurr1 appears to restrict the C17.2 cell line to neuronal lineages, no
significant tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, a marker for dopaminergic
neurons) immunoreactivity was detected in any of the Nurr1 clones
under these conditions (data not shown), suggesting that the fate of
these neurons is not dopaminergic.
As Nurr1 possessed lineage-restricting capacity in our clonal
lines but alone was unable to direct dopaminergic characteristics, we
treated the Nurr1 lines with a variety of trophic factors, mitogens,
cytokines, and other agents known to be important in proliferation

insulin-like growth factor, fetal calf serum), differentiation (sonic
hedgehog, Shh; retinoic acid; forskolin; dopamine), and survival of
endogenous dopaminergic neurons (glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor, GDNF; neurturin; brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF; neurotrophin-3 (NT-3); ciliary neurotrophic factor,
CNTF). None of these factors, alone or combined, induced TH
expression in any of the clones (data not shown).Finally, to test
whether as yet unidentified, regionally specific local factors were
required, we co-cultured the Nurr1 clones with primary cultures
derived from E16 rat ventral mesencephalic (VM), the age and
region where endogenous dopaminergic neurons of the substantia
nigra have just been born15. Under these conditions a small, yet significant, percentage of isolated cells, and occasionally mitotic clusters, from two of the Nurr1 lines demonstrated measurable amounts
of TH immunoreactivity (Fig. 2), whereas little or no TH staining
was seen in other Nurr1 lines, the C17.2 parent, or any of the mock
control lines.
Collectively, these observations suggested that a factor derived
from the primary cultures interacted directly or indirectly with
Nurr1 to induce TH-expressing neurons. However, because TH
expression was limited to a minority subpopulation within a fraction of the Nurr1 clones, some property of the primary cultures or of
the Nurr1 clones themselves must have been limiting. We next examined the effects of Nurr1 on the differentiative capacity of C17.2 cells,
measured by acute BrdU incorporation after passage into SFM, and
found varied levels of proliferation (Fig. 3A). Although there was a

Figure 3. High proliferative rates in Nurr1-overexpressing clones
correlate with high induction of TH-positive neurons from C17.2Nurr1 in VM co-cultures. (A) Residual proliferative rate of the
parental-, Nurr1-, or mock-C17.2 clones demonstrated that C17.2Nurr1 clones with higher residual proliferation also showed the
higher number of TH-positive neurons (clones 4 and 42, compare
with Fig. 2). (B) A significant linear relationship (r2 = 0.890 by
regression) between the proliferative capacity of the Nurr1overexpressing clones at the initiation of co-culture (with or without
bFGF pretreatment) and the expression of TH after differentiation
was found, suggesting that Nurr1-overexpressing clones must be
mitotic during the initial phases of contact with primary VM cells for
optimal induction of TH-positive neurons. This was further
supported by the observation that, (C) at the time when most THexpressing c42 cells begin appearing in co-culture (six DIV), nearly
all of them are still mitotic (BrdU positive); however, these cells
rapidly withdraw from the cell cycle by nine DIV.

trend toward increased differentiation within the Nurr1 clones, no
clear effect of the transgene on this process was seen. However, we
noted that Nurr1 clones with the highest residual proliferation in
SFM (4 and 42) also demonstrated significant TH expression in coculture (compare Figs 3A and 2A). We then reasoned that increasing
the proliferation of other Nurr1 clones should also increase the number of TH-expressing neurons. Thus, we pretreated Nurr1 clones
with bFGF for five DIV (a procedure that elevates baseline proliferation of most clones after passage into SFM alone) before splitting
and replating into primary ventral mesencephalic cultures. Such a
procedure allowed us to selectively examine the effects of bFGF on
the Nurr1 clones and eliminated the mitogenic and indirect trophic
effects of bFGF on the primary cultures. As expected, BrdU labeling
of bFGF-pretreated Nurr1 clones was increased at 24 h after passage
of cells into co-culture compared with cells directly split out of
serum-containing medium (rightward shift of individual clones on
x-axis, Fig. 3B). Concomitant with this increase in proliferation,
proportional increases in the percentage of TH-positive cells were
observed in all of the Nurr1 clones (upward shift of clones on y-axis,
Fig. 3B), reaching as high as 45% TH positive (clone 42). In fact,

Figure 4. Retinoids and bFGF increase the number of TH-positive
neurons derived from C17.2-Nurr1, but not from C17.2 cells, in VM
co-cultures. Addition of SR11237 (SR, 1 mM) and bFGF (F, 10 ng/ml) to
VM/C17.2 co-cultures (C) in SFM did not enhance the differentiation
of parental C17.2 cells into TH-positive neurons. Instead, both SR
and bFGF increased the number of TH-positive neurons originated
from the C17.2-Nurr1-c42 cell line (c42) in co-cultures in SFM at
seven DIV. Moreover, the effects of bFGF could be substituted by
EGF (E), and were additive with those of SR.

regression analysis indicated a significant linear relationship
between mitosis at the beginning of culture and propensity to
express TH within, as well as between, individual clones after nine
DIV. The C17.2 parental cell line, which responded robustly to bFGF
pretreatment, demonstrated minimal increases in TH expression.
Thus, our results suggest that an important determinant of
dopaminergic fate within individual Nurr1 clones is their proliferative capacity.
Previous studies examining the adoption of phenotypic fate during cerebral cortical16 and spinal cord17 development have demonstrated that exposure of noncommitted neuroblasts to spatially
restricted local factors induces specific phenotypes within these populations, but this induction is contingent upon continuous exposure
up to and including the terminal S phase of the neuroblast. A similar
mechanism may underlie our observations as most TH-expressing
cells are also BrdU positive after acute pulsing at six DIV (Fig. 3C), a
time at which the greatest numbers of TH-positive cells begin to
appear. However, after acute BrdU treatment of co-cultures at nine
DIV, the vast majority of TH-positive cells are BrdU negative, suggesting withdrawal from the cell cycle following induction of measurable TH expression. Taken together, these observations indicate
that exposure of a mitotic Nurr1 clone to the primary cultures is prerequisite for the determination of dopaminergic fate.
Charcterization of inductive signal. To examine whether molecules important for dopaminergic development18–20 (e.g., Shh,
retinoic acid, or bFGF) could be the inductive signal derived from
the ventral mesencephalon (VM), co-cultures of VM and C17.2Nurr1 cells were treated with blocking antibodies to bFGF or Shh, or
specific retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoic X receptor (RXR)
antagonists (data not shown). However, none of these molecules
prevented the basal induction of TH expression in C17.2-Nurr1-c42
(c42) in co-culture (i.e., ~10%; see Fig. 2). We next tested whether

phenotype on C17.2-Nurr1 neural stem cells in SFM. (A) E16 VM
adherent cells (Ad+) enhanced the induction of TH in the Nurr1-c42
line compared with total (Tot) primary cells or nonadherent (Ad-)
cells. Moreover, T1A, which are enriched in the Ad+ fraction, induced
a dramatic increase in the number of dopaminergic cells derived
from the Nurr1-c42 line in the absence of any added factor. The same
level of activity was also possessed by postnatal day 1 (P1) T1A from
the VM (A and B). This activity was very labile and could not be
recovered from conditioned media or a membrane fraction from T1A,
but could be recovered when Nurr1-c42 cells were cultured
separated by a microporous insert (A and C), suggesting that a
diffusible factor was involved. (D) In co-cultures of Nurr1-c42 cells
(c42) with T1A from other brain regions, including cortex (CTX),
hippocampus (HC), and spinal cord (SC), Nurr1-c42 cells acquired
unique, regionally distinct neuronal morphologies, as assessed by
lacZ immunocytochemistry, but no induction of dopaminergic
phenotype was observed (A and D). The induction of these
phenotypes was specific to the Nurr1-c42 cells and was not
observed in parental C17.2 cells co-cultured with T1A from areas
other than the VM, suggesting a remarkable regionally specific
inductive potential of T1As.

treating c42/VM co-cultures with combinations of the previously
mentioned proliferative, differentiation, and trophic factors could
increase the number of TH-positive neurons. Treatments to the
c42/VM cocultures were generally ineffective, with three important
exceptions: bFGF, EGF, and the synthetic retinoid analog SR11237
(Fig. 4), each of which induced TH expression in 40–60% of the
population after six DIV. Furthermore, the effects of SR11237 and
bFGF or EGF were additive at saturating doses (up to 90% lacZ positive were TH positive), suggesting that these molecules may act
through distinct mechanisms: increased proliferation, as both bFGF
and EGF are directly mitogenic to the C17.2 cells21; and RXR receptor stimulation, as SR11237 specifically stimulates RXR receptors22,
which heterodimerize with Nurr1 and/or other nuclear receptors to
form transcription-initiating complexes23. Thus, these results suggest that FGF and retinoids, although not inductive signals in our

system, act to enhance the efficiency of TH induction. Thus, the only
obligate requirement for the induction of a dopaminergic phenotype
seemed to be exposure of Nurr1-expressing neural stem cells to signals derived from primary VM cells.
What is the nature and cellular source of such an inductive signal? Primary VM cultures typically contain a mixture of dopaminergic and other neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, as well as
assorted nonneural elements such as microglia, endothelial cells, and
fibroblasts. To begin identifying the source of this TH-promoting
activity, we performed a crude separation of the primary cells based
on adhesion. The rapidly adherent population was enriched for glial
and nonneural elements, whereas the nonadherent population consisted mainly of neurons, oligodendrocyte precursors, and a few
astrocytes. After co-culture of these fractions with c42, we determined that the majority of TH-inducing activity was contained
within the rapidly adherent population (Fig. 5A). As the major neural constituent of this population was type 1 astrocytes (T1A), we prepared purified cultures of these cells from E16 VM and were able to
verify that T1A were indeed the source of TH-inducing activity.
Furthermore, this activity was not restricted to early development, as
astrocytes isolated from newborn rats induced equivalent numbers
of TH-positive c42 cells (~70%, Fig. 5A). In order to determine if
this activity was due to a soluble or a membrane-bound factor, we

differentiation. (A) HPLC traces show that supernatants collected
from KCl-depolarized Nurr1-c42 cells (c42), but not the parental
C17.2 cells, contained dopamine and its metabolite DOPAC.
Moreover, factors enhancing dopaminergic differentiation, such as
bFGF and SR11237, similarly enhanced the amount of dopamine
release, in c42 cells, but were ineffective in C17.2 cells. (B) After
dopaminergic differentiation, almost all Nurr1-c42, but not parental
cells, expressed the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (AHD-2), a
marker associated with endogenous dopaminergic neurons of the
midbrain. (C). Nurr1-c42 cells induced to differentiate into
dopaminergic neurons respond to multiple neurotrophic fators
similarly to midbrain dopaminergic neurons. bFGF (10 ng/ml) and NT3 (30 ng/ml) dramatically increased the number of TH-positive cells

media or membrane fragments, respectively. However, neither of
these treatments induced significant increases in the number of THexpressing cells, suggesting that this activity was highly labile. To circumvent this problem, we co-cultured astrocytes and C17.2-Nurr1c42 cells, but spatially separated the two populations via a microporous insert, which allowed free passage of macromolecules but prevented contact between the two populations. In this environment,
TH expression was induced in C17.2-Nurr1-c42 cells at a level equivalent to direct co-culture (Fig. 5A and C), suggesting that ventral

rons during development, secrete a highly labile diffusible factor that
interacts with Nurr1-overexpressing stem cells to generate TH-positive neurons.
We next examined whether the TH-inductive activity is restricted
to type 1 astrocytes from the VM. Type 1 astrocytes were isolated
from several brain regions that contain populations of Nurr1expressing cells during development26. No increase in the number of
TH-immunoreactive cells was observed in c42, compared with
parental C17.2 cells, when co-cultured with cerebrocortical, hippocampal, or spinal cord astrocytes (Fig. 5A), indicating that a putative TH-inducing factor is selectively produced by ventral mesencephalic type 1 astrocytes. However, c42 cells were not completely
unaffected by astrocytes from other regions; cells of this line developed distinct, neuronal-like morphologies unique to each region
(Fig. 5D). Under the same conditions, however, the C17.2 parental
line tended to display a uniform mixture of polygonal, and bi- and
tripolar morphologies. Collectively, these data raise the intriguing
possibility that astrocytes from distinct brain regions secrete unique,
or unique combinations of, factors that interact with Nurr1-expressing cells to produce specific, and perhaps regionally appropriate,
neuronal phenotypes. Confirmation of this hypothesis awaits
detailed phenotypic analysis of multiple Nurr1 lines under such conditions.
Mechanism. Perhaps the simplest mechanism for dopaminergic
induction would involve the secretion by astrocytes of a putative ligand for Nurr1, which in turn activates appropriate intracellular
machinery involved in the expression of the specific TH-positive
phenotype. We found that significant Nurr1 transactivational activity was detected 36 h after cotransfection of our Nurr1 expression
vector and a Nurr1-responsive luciferase reporter, but not after
transfection of the reporter into the stable, proliferating C17.2Nurr1 clones (Fig. 6A), as well as differentiated clones (data not
shown). Because Nurr1 was not active during the neuronal differentiation of stable C17.2-Nurr1 clones, our findings suggest that earlier
transient high levels of Nurr1 activity may have conferred upon the
Nurr1 clones long-lasting competence to be dopaminergic. To test
this hypothesis we examined changes in gene expression in the Nurr1
clones. We observed that the C17.2 and all mock clones examined
expressed high levels of the GDNF receptor GFRa1 mRNA and very
low levels of the related receptor GFRa2 mRNA. In contrast, all
Nurr1 clones demonstrated the inverse profile, that is, very low
GFRa1 and very high GFRa2 mRNA levels (Fig. 6B), suggesting that
in C17.2 cells, Nurr1 regulates target genes before actual induction of
a TH-positive phenotype. In such a way, Nurr1 may bestow competence upon multipotent cells to respond to specific factors, including
those derived from ventral mesencephalic astrocytes.
Specificity. We examined whether the gain of TH expression represented the adoption of a legitimate dopaminergic phenotype within the C17.2-Nurr1-c42 line. By convention, the ability to release
dopamine in response to membrane depolarization is the vital criterion for designation of a neurochemical phenotype as dopaminergic.
Thus, we acutely treated co-cultures of parental or c42 lines and VM
astrocytes with 50 mM KCl and assayed the supernatants for
monoamine content with HPLC. Significant levels of dopamine and
DOPAC, a major dopamine metabolite, were detected in supernatants from co-cultures containing c42, with increased release
detected in co-cultures treated with SR11237 and bFGF, thereby correlating dopamine release to the number of TH-expressing cells (Fig.
7A). No dopamine release was observed in the parental line. Thus,
TH-expressing C17.2-Nurr1-c42 cells may be considered dopaminergic. However, is the phenotype of this line of a ventral mesencephalic dopaminergic type? As complete criteria for this distinction within
endogenous precursor populations remain undefined, one cannot
fully ascertain whether our Nurr1 lines adopt a complete mesencephalic phenotype. Nonetheless, C17.2-Nurr1-c42 cells in co-cul657

ture also acquired immunoreactivity for aldehyde dehydrogenase-2
(AHD-2; Fig. 7B), an enzyme selectively expressed in developing
dopaminergic precursors within the VM27 and expressed c-ret
mRNA (data not shown), the signaling receptor for GDNF28,29 that is
present in dopaminergic neurons28. Furthermore, TH-positive c42
cells demonstrated similar responses to factors with known neurotrophic effects on dopaminergic progenitors8 and primary ventral
mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in vitro30,31 (Fig. 7C). Thus,
inasmuch as the behavior of TH-expressing c42 cells parallels that of
endogenous dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, these
cells should be considered ventral mesencephalic-like dopaminergic
neurons.
Stability of the iduction. After eight days in insert co-cultures,
c42 cells were removed from the inserts and replated into defined
media without additional factors for 14 days. Although significant
cellular attrition was observed two weeks after removal from co-culture, a small but significant number of cells displayed a highly
mature dopaminergic phenotype, including long, elaborate processes, hypertrophic cell bodies, and intense levels of TH immunoreactivity (Fig. 7D). c42 cells from parallel co-cultures also were surgically injected into adult mouse corpus striatum and allowed to mature
for 12 days, in the absence of any additional trophic factors or supportive cells (i.e., astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or other neurons).
Although many cells were lost in this condition, a few c42-derived
dopaminergic cells displayed a high level of differentiation and
apparent integration into the host tissue (Fig. 7E). No TH-positive
cell derived from the C17.2 parental line were found in either of the
long-term in vitro or in vivo experiments. Thus, the observation that
some c42 cells maintained, or even increased, TH expression after
removal from T1A-derived factors shows that, after dopaminergic
induction, their phenotype is stable. However, since few surviving
TH-positive cells could be detected, exogenously applied trophic factors or supporting cells may be required for long-term survival.
In conclusion, our results suggest that Nurr1 induces neuronal
differentiation and confers competence to respond to extrinsic signals that induce dopaminergic fate. Moreover, the current study
demonstrates that the source of such signals are VM astrocytes,
which release a soluble factor that induces Nurr1-expressing neural
stem cells to develop into typical dopaminergic neurons of the VM.
Our findings further suggest that primary astrocytes may be the
source of signals required for the induction of regionally appropriate
neuronal phenotypes in multiple brain structures. Finally, the procedure we describe, taking advantage of the multipotential capacity of
neural stem cells, selector genes such as Nurr1, and primary astrocytes, might be used to engineer neurons with the desired neurochemical phenotype as a source material for neuronal transplantation in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In this respect,
the induction of an unlimited number of midbrain dopaminergic
neurons in vitro, that can engraft in vivo, could prove particularly
useful in cell replacement strategies to treat Parkinson’s disease.

(Ambion Inc., Austin, TX), following the manufacturer’s recommendations.
A 288 bp antisense Nurr1 cRNA probe spanning nucleotides 1,798–2,086 of
the mouse Nurr1 cDNA sequence32 was transcribed with T7 (from a mNurr1
cDNA cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI site of the pBSKS expression vector
[Stratagene, La Jolla, CA] linearized with EcoRI) and labeled with (a658

32P)CTP (Amersham Intl., Little Chalfont, UK). Protected cRNA fragments

were separated on 4% PAGE under denaturing conditions. The intensity of
the signal was analyzed with a phosphoimager MD storm 840 (Molecular
Dynamics), and Nurr1 signal was standardized to the content of glyceraldehide 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in every sample. GFRa expression was analyzed similarly, using probes already described33.
Cell culture and treatments. C17.2 neural stem cells were maintained and
passaged as previously described4. Ventral mesencephala from E16 rat
embryos were dissected, mechanically dissociated, and plated at a final density of 1 ´ 105 cells/cm2 on poly-D-lysine–coated culture wells in SFM (N2,
consisting of a 1:1 mixture of F12 and DMEM containing 10 ng/ml insulin,
100 mg/m transferrin, 100 mM putrescine, 20 nM progesterone, 30 nM selenium, 6 mg/ml glucose, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, BSA). After 24 h
in vitro, co-cultures were initiated by directly plating 2.5–5 ´ 104 C17.2derived cells into the primary cultures; all ages of cultures given use this point
as zero DIV. This sequence of plating and ratio of primary/C17.2 cells resulted in the healthiest cultures, although varying the numbers of C17.2 cells
over a 10-fold range did not significantly affect the proportion of TH-positive
cells observed (data not shown). Purified type 1 astrocytes were obtained
from mixed glial cultures derived from various regions of P1 rats according to
a standard protocol34. After replating into 6- or 12-well plates, astrocytes were
grown to confluency in serum-containing media and changed to N2 medium. After three to five DIV, co-cultures were initiated in fresh N2 as
described. All factors were added once, at the initiation of co-culture (concentrations are noted in figure legends), with the exception of BrdU, which
was added 4–6 h before fixation. Cultures were maintained in a humidified
5% CO2, 95% air incubator at 37°C and fixed after given time periods with
4% paraformaldehyde for 45 min before immunocytochemical analysis.
Immunocytochemical analysis and HPLC. Fixed cultures were incubated
with one of the following antibodies, diluted appropriately in PBS containing
1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100: mouse anti-BrdU, 1:50 (DAKO, Glostrup,
Denmark), mouse anti-b-tubulin, type III (TuJ1), 1:250 (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO), mouse anti-TH, 1:1,000 (Incstar, Stillwater, MN), rabbit anti-b-galactosidase, 1:250 (Cappel, Durham, NC)) rabbit anti-glial fibrilary acidic protein (GFAP), 1:500 (DAKO), rabbit anti–AHD-2, 1:4,000 (generous gift of
Dr. R. Lindahl, University of South Carolina, School of Medicine).
Incubations were either carried out at 4°C overnight, or at room temperature
for 1 h. Both processes yielded similar results. After washing, cultures were
incubated for 1–3 h with appropriate secondary antibodies (biotinylated
horse anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG, Vector, Burlingame, CA),
1:100, in the same dilution buffer. Immunostaining was visualized with the
Vector Laboratory ABC immunoperoxidase kit, using either (red) AEC, grey
(SG) , or violet (VIP) substrates. Fluorescent double-labeling of b-galactosidase (b-gal) was performed by substituting the biotinylated secondary with
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antibody (Vector), 1:100.
Quantitative immunocytochemical data represent means and standard errors
from 100 to 500 cells counted in each of three to six separate wells from two to
four experiments. For quantitation of TH expression in co-cultures of primary and C17.2–derived cells, TH was visualized with the bright-field AEC or
VIP substrate, while b-gal was assessed using FITC; thus, all data expressed as
“percent TH positive” represent the number of TH-positive/b-gal-positive
divided by total b-gal-positive cells. The bright-field staining of these markers in Figure 4 was performed for presentation purposes only.
For analysis of dopamine release, large (10 cm) co-cultures containing ~1
million C17.2-Nurr1-c42 or C17.2 parental cells with P1 VM T1A were treated with 200 ml of 50 mM KCl in PBS/0.1 M sodium citrate for 5 min while
swirling. The supernatants were immediately assayed for dopamine content
using HPLC. Samples were separated with a reverse-phase C-18 column,
eluted with acetonitrile, and detected electrochemically. Results were verified
with a standard containing dopamine, DOPAC, serotonin, and 5-hydroxylindoleacetic acid.
Long-term cultures and transplantation. Parental C17.2 cells or C17.2Nurr1-c42 cells were grown in large (10 cm) insert co-cultures with VM type
1 astrocytes for eight days in the presence of bFGF (10 ng/ml) and SR11237 (1
mM). Cells were then trypsinized off of the insert, pelleted, and resuspended,
at a concentration of 100,000 cells/ml, in their own conditioned media; an
aliquot of this mixture was then plated into poly-D-lysine–treated six-well
tissue culture plates containing N2 media, while the remainder were used for
transplantation. Adult (25–30 g) CD1 mice (Charles River, Uppsala,
Sweden), housed and treated according to the guidelines of the European
Community (86/609/EEC), were anesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg
intraperitoneally). A total of 25,000 cells were stereotaxically injected into the

striatum at each of the two following coordinates (in mm): AP (bregma) =
0.56, L = 1.9, DV(dura) = -2.55 and -2.75, with the incisor bar at -3. Twelve
days after grafting, mice were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were postfixed for 2 h, embedded in 10% sucrose for more than
one day, and frozen in dry-ice cooled isopentane. We then processed 14 mm
cryostat sections for TH immunohistochemistry using a mouse anti-TH
(Incstar) 1:1,000, and a donkey anti-mouse rhodamine (Jackson, West Grove,
PA) 1:100, antibodies. TH-positive cells were photographed using a
Hamamatsu camera attached to a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope.
