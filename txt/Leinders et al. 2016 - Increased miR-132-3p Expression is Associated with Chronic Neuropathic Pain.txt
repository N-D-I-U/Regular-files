Abstract

Author Manuscript

Alterations in the neuro-immune balance play a major role in the pathophysiology of chronic
neuropathic pain. MicroRNAs (miRNA) can regulate both immune and neuronal processes and
may function as master switches in chronic pain development and maintenance. We set out to
analyze the role of miR-132-3p, first in patients with peripheral neuropathies and second in an
animal model of neuropathic pain. We initially determined miR-132-3p expression by measuring
its levels in white blood cells (WBC) of 30 patients and 30 healthy controls and next in sural nerve
biopsies of 81 patients with painful or painless inflammatory or non-inflammatory neuropathies
based on clinical diagnosis. We found a 2.6 fold increase in miR-132-3p expression in WBC of
neuropathy patients compared to healthy controls (p<0.001). MiR-132-3p expression was also
slightly up-regulated in sural nerve biopsies from neuropathy patients suffering from neuropathic
pain compared to those without pain (1.2 fold; p<0.001).
These promising findings were investigated further in an animal model of neuropathic pain, the
spared nerve injury model (SNI). For this purpose miR-132-3p expression levels were measured in
dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord of rats. Subsequently, miR-132-3p expression was
pharmacologically modulated with miRNA antagonists or mimetics, and evoked pain and pain
aversion were assessed.

Spinal miR-132-3p levels were highest 10 days after SNI, a time when persistent allodynia was
established (p<0.05). Spinal administration of miR-132-3p antagonists via intrathecal (i.t.)
catheters dose dependently reversed mechanical allodyina (p<0.001) and eliminated pain behavior
in the place escape avoidance paradigm (p<0.001). Intrathecal administration of miR-132-3p
mimetic dose-dependently induced pain behavior in naïve rats (p<0.001). Taken together these
results indicate a pro-nociceptive effect of miR-132-3p in chronic neuropathic pain.

Introduction
Neuropathic pain is characteristically severe and persistent and may greatly impair health
related quality of life by additionally inducing anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairment
(Breivik et al., 2006). There is ample evidence for a potential role of the immune system and
particularly of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in the pathophysiology of neuropathic
pain (Kuner, 2010; McMahon and Malcangio, 2009). Peripheral neuropathies of the same
etiology can either be painful or painless (Üçeyler et al., 2007). The mechanism for this
discrepancy is unknown.

In recent years, non-coding RNAs have been studied in normal cellular functioning as well
as in pathological processes (Huttenhofer and Schattner, 2006; Mattick, 2004). Micro-RNAs
(miRNAs) are a family of non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene
expression by inhibiting mRNA translation or inhibiting mRNA and protein degradation
(Mattick, 2004). Various diseases, including neuropathic pain disorders, appear to possess
unique miRNA expression signatures. Recent reports on modulation of miRNA function in
both neuronal and immune processes predict the therapeutic potential of manipulating
miRNAs in diseases affecting the immune system and the brain (O’Connor et al., 2012;
Soreq and Wolf, 2011). miRNAs that communicate between the nervous and immune system
have been termed “neurimmiRs” and primarily target transcription factors or other
regulatory genes, which enable simultaneous cross-communication between neural and
immune compartments (Soreq and Wolf, 2011). Thus, miRNAs possibly control cellular
pathways in multiple systems and act as “master-switches” (Soreq and Wolf, 2011).
Aberrant expression of several miRNAs has been reported throughout many peripheral and
central nervous system loci associated with pain perception (Aldrich et al., 2009; Bai et al.,
2007; Imai et al., 2011; Kusuda et al., 2011; von Schack et al., 2011). First reports
describing characteristic miRNA expression profiles in blood or cerebrospinal fluid of
patients with distinct pain conditions are starting to emerge (Andersen et al., 2016; Beyer et
al., 2015; Bjersing et al., 2013; Orlova et al., 2011), however evidence linking specific
miRNA expression profiles to specific pain disorders is still insufficient.

miR-132 is abundantly expressed in the brain and is emerging as a regulator of cognition,
neuronal plasticity, and memory. It can regulate synapse structure and function (Bredy et al.,
2011; Miller et al., 2012; Schratt, 2009; Soreq and Wolf, 2011). Hippocampal miR-132
mediates stress-induced cognitive deficits through suppression of acetylcholinesterase
(Haramati et al., 2011) and miR-132 has recently been implicated in neuropathic pain after
chronic constriction injury (CCI) (Arai et al., 2013). Similarly, spinal cord miR-132 is now
proposed as a mediator of neuropathic pain following spared nerve injury (SNI) (Zhang et
al., 2015). However, direct links between pain and miR-132 expression levels in human
and/or animal models of neuropathic pain still remain elusive.

The current studies evaluated blood and sural nerve miR-132-3p, a splice variant of
miR-132, expression in patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain accompanying
peripheral neuropathy and analyzed the role of miR-132-3p in pain behavior in an animal
model of neuropathic pain.

Patient assessment and diagnostic classification—Patients with neuropathies of
different etiologies were recruited at the Department of Neurology, University of Würzburg
between 2014 and 2015, where they underwent diagnostic work-up, including sural nerve
biopsy. The study was approved by the Würzburg Medical Faculty Ethics Committee and
written informed consent was obtained from every study participant before recruitment. The
diagnosis of neuropathy was based on characteristic symptoms and signs in the neurological
examination and typical findings in the electrophysiological assessment with standard nerve
conduction studies in motor and sensory nerves of the upper and lower limbs (Kimura,
2001). Motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and evoked compound muscle action
potential of the median, tibial and peroneal nerves were measured orthodromically. Sensory
conduction velocity and amplitude of the nerve action potential were measured
antidromically in the median and sural nerves. Skin temperature in both upper and lower
extremities was controlled (> 32°C) during the examinations. For differential diagnosis
detailed laboratory studies included: glucose metabolism (HbA1c, oral glucose tolerance
test), whole blood and differential cell counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive
protein, serum electrolytes, monoclonal immunoglobulins, vitamin levels (B6, B12), folic
acid, renal and liver function tests, thyroid function tests, anti-nuclear antigen (ENA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA), rheumatoid factor, serology of borreliosis,
immunofixation, and serum electrophoresis. In addition, all patients submitted to a
diagnostic lumbar puncture, and cerebrospinal fluid was checked for pathological cell counts
and protein levels. Diagnostic subgroups and definition of neuropathies are summarized in
supplemental patient diagnostic criteria.

Author Manuscript

All patients were specifically asked for details regarding symptoms and signs that may have
been associated with other sources of pain, any patient reporting other sources of pain or
ongoing infection was excluded. Neuropathies were classified as painful if the patients
reported pain with an intensity of 3 or more on a numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0
to 10 (0 meaning “no pain” and 10 “worst pain imaginable”), as previously reported
(Üçeyler et al., 2015; Üçeyler et al., 2007). The Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS) (Von
Korff et al., 1992) for 4 week recall and the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI)
(Bouhassira et al., 2004) for the last 24 h recall were also used to assess pain. The control
group consisted of healthy and age-and sex-matched (to the neuropathy patients shown in
Fig. 1A) volunteers without infectious disease or pain at study inclusion.
Blood withdrawal for miRNA expression analysis—To reduce circadian variations,
venous blood was collected from 30/81 patients and 30 healthy controls between 8:00 and
9:00 AM. For quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR), 9 ml whole blood was withdrawn in

EDTA-containing tubes and the total white blood cell fraction (WBC) isolated. Isolated
WBCs were re-suspended in RNA-cell protective reagent (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and
stored at −80°C until further processing.
Sural nerve biopsy—Diagnostic sural nerve biopsy was performed in 67/81 patients at
the Department of Neurosurgery, University of Würzburg (Dyck et al., 2005). For miRNA
expression analysis, approximately 4 mm of the biopsy specimen was separated and stored
in RNA-later overnight at 4°C; on the following day RNA-later was removed and the
specimen was frozen at −80°C.

PCR amplification of miRNA—Peripheral nerve specimens as the basis of major
pathology were obtained from patients and rats. Isolation of miRNAs was performed on all
samples (WBCs, nerve, DRGs and spinal cord) using the miRNEASY kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany), following the manufacturer’s protocol. For the generation of miRNA-specific
first strand cDNA, 5 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the Universal cDNA
Synthesis kit II (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) following manufacturer’s recommendations.
For each reaction, 4 μl of diluted (1:80) cDNA was PCR amplified applying the
corresponding miRNA and reference primer sets, using the miCURY LNA™ Universal
microRNA PCR (Exiqon). The expression levels of miR-132-3p (5′-3′
UAACAGUCUACAGCCAUGGUCG, MIMAT0000426) and its splice variant miR-132-5p
(5′-3′ ACCGUGGCUUUCGAUUGUUACU, MIMAT0004594) were normalized to the
expression of endogenous 5s RNA (5s RNA, V00589). For individual target normalization,
we tested different endogenous controls (U6, snord48, snord44, and 5sRNA) of which
5sRNA (housekeeping gene) was the most stable and thus, was used for both human and rat
tissue. Each miRNA was amplified in triplicate and threshold cycle (Ct) values were
obtained. Fold changes in miRNA expression among groups were calculated using interplate
calibrators (a standard sample that was run on each PCR plate) by means of the delta-delta
Ct method.

miRNA target validation—We set out to analyze the role of AMPA-receptor subunit
GluA1, in an animal model of neuropathic pain. We performed a comprehensive target
prediction analysis of miR-132-3p by employing four databases: TargetScan (Friedman et
al., 2009), microRNA.org (Betel et al., 2008), miRTarBase (Hsu et al., 2011), and
DIANAmicroT (Paraskevopoulou et al., 2013). GluA1 was identified as a potential
downstream target by at least two of the four prediction algorithms. To further narrow down
the numerous miRNA downstream candidates we performed an additional Blastn alignment
search (Altschul et al., 1990) of GluA1 (NM_031608.1) to specifically check for putative
binding sites of miR-132-3p in the GluA1 gene.
Animals—Adult male Holtzman rats (250–300 g, Harlan Industries, Indianapolis, USA)
were used. Animals were fed ad libitum and maintained in a controlled temperature and
humidity environment, under a 12 h light/dark cycle. Animals recovered from shipping for a
minimum of 2 days before entering the study; on the day of the experiment, animals were
allowed to acclimate to the laboratory and test equipment for at least 1 h. All procedures
were performed during the light cycle. Experiments were in compliance with the National

Intrathecal catheterization and spared nerve injury (SNI)—Naïve rats were
anesthetized with isoflurane (5% induction-, 2.5% maintenance) in a 50% O2/room air
mixture. Polyethylene (PE-5, 8.5 cm, Scientific Commodities Inc., AZ, USA) catheters were
implanted intrathecally under aseptic conditions, as described elsewhere (Malkmus and
Yaksh, 2004). The catheter tip ended over the L4 spinal segment. Immediately after
implantation, SNI or a sham surgery was performed, according to the method of Decosterd
and Woolf (Decosterd and Woolf, 2000). Briefly, skin on the lateral surface of the left thigh
was incised and a blunt dissection made directly through the biceps femoris muscle, thereby
exposing the sciatic nerve. Distal to the trifurcation of its branches, the common peroneal
and the tibial nerves were tightly ligated, using 5.0 silk and a 2–4 mm piece of each distal
nerve stump was removed; the sural nerve was untouched. Incisions were closed with
muscle and skin sutures. In sham surgery, the sciatic nerve branches were exposed, but not
otherwise harmed. All rats received subcutaneous lactated Ringer’s solution (1 cc/50 g body
weight, Baxter HealthCare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA) with carprofen (5 mg/kg,
Rimadyl Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA) immediately post-surgery and were housed
individually. Behavioral experiments were conducted 5–21 days after surgery. Rats that
displayed behavioral or motor deficits or loss of cannula patency were excluded from the
study (less than 1%).

Author Manuscript

Behavioral paradigm and testing—Behavioral testing was conducted between 9:00
AM and 4:00 PM by an experimenter blinded to treatment group. Mechanical paw
withdrawal thresholds were determined prior to i.t. drug delivery (baseline, day 0) and at
designated time points after unilateral SNI of the left hind limb (days 5, 10, 14, 18, 20). In
one small subset of animals (3–4/group), days 11, 12, 13 and 21 were added.

Author Manuscript

Nociceptive threshold testing—Rats were placed on an elevated mesh floor in
individual test chambers. Withdrawal thresholds to punctate mechanical stimuli were
determined using calibrated von Frey filaments (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL, USA) and the
“up-down” method as described previously (Chaplan et al., 1994). Latencies to thermal
stimulation were determined using a modified Hargreaves system (UCSD University
Anesthesia Research and Development Group, CA, USA) (Dirig et al., 1997). After 45 min
of adaptation on a glass plate, a radiant heat stimulus was delivered to each individual paw
and withdrawal latency was recorded. Each hindpaw was tested 3 times and the average of
all 6 tests was used as the animal mean. To prevent tissue damage by the heat, we used a
stimulus cut-off time of 20 s.
Place escape avoidance paradigm (PEAP)—To test the aversive aspect of pain the
place escape avoidance paradigm (PEAP) was employed (Fuchs and McNabb, 2012). Rats
were allowed unrestricted movement within a box (40.6 × 15.9 × 30.5 cm Plexiglas) one end
of which was opaque black (sides and the top of the dark area) and the other end semitranslucent white (sides and top-light area). The animals were placed in the light area at the

start of each test session. Mechanical stimulation with a suprathreshold von Frey
monofilament (255 mN; 26 g) was applied at 15 s intervals to the sural nerve receptive field
on the plantar paw. When the animal was on the dark side of the box, the left (i.e. injured)
paw was stimulated and when the animal was in the light area, the right (i.e. uninjured) paw
was stimulated. The location of the animal at the time of stimulus presentation was noted
over the entire test period of 35 min. The percentage of stimuli applied to each foot was
calculated and interpreted as time spent on each side of the test chamber.

MiRNA inhibitor and mimetic—A locked-nucleic acid (LNA) based in vivo inhibitor for
miR-132-3p and a mismatch control (scrambled oligonucleotide, Scr) were purchased from
Exiqon (Vedbaek, Denmark). Sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows:
miR-132-3p (5′-3′ ATGGCTGTAGACTGTT) and Scr (5′-3′ ACGTCTATACGCCCA). A
miRIDIAN microRNA mimetic for miR-132-3p (C-320363-03-0002) (Dharmacon, GE
Healthcare Europe, Freiburg, Germany) was custom-modified with a 3′-cholesterol
conjugation on the passenger strand to facilitate its in vivo uptake. Both inhibitor and
mimetics were synthesized from ribonucleotides and their functional efficacy was tested in
vivo. Both oligonucleotides were purified via HPLC and the lyophilized powder was
reconstituted in 1x PBS at pH 7.4 at concentrations of 1 mM and stored in aliquots at −20°C
to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.

Author Manuscript

The inhibitor and mimetic were administered to awake rats via the i.t. catheters. Prior to
injection, active or mismatch inhibitors were mixed with (1:5 w/v) i-Fect™ in vivo
transfection reagent (Neuromics, Edina, USA) to final doses of 5, 2 and 1 μg in 10 μl. Bolus
injections were performed every 24 h for 3 consecutive days starting on day 10 after SNI or
sham surgery. The mimetic was mixed with i-Fect™ (1:5 w/v) to final doses of 8, 5, 3 and 1
μg and the injection sequence to naïve animals followed the same pattern as that for the
antagonist. Each drug was mixed with sterile saline at pH 7.4 to achieve the desired dilution.
Each injection was followed by a 10 μl saline flush.

Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemistry—Rats, that had been injected with mimetic or the Scr control,
were deeply anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and perfused with room temperature saline,
followed by cold (4 °C) 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The
lumbar enlargement, and L4 and L5 DRGs were harvested and post-fixed for 4 h; tissue was
cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PBS. Fixed tissue was embedded in O.C.T.
compound (Tissue-Tek, Torrance, CA, USA) and stored at −20 °C. Transverse DRG and
spinal cord sections (10 μm) were cut on a Leica CM 1800 cryostat. Spinal cord sections
were mounted and labeled with goat anti-Iba1 (microglia, 1:750, Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA), mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, astrocytes, 1:500; Millipore
Temecula, CA, USA) and goat-anti MAC387 (MAC387, macrophages, 1:250, Thermo
Fischer, Rockford, IL, USA), to check for signs of glial activation in the spinal cord dorsal
horn and infiltration of peripheral macrophages at the injection site (catheter tip). The DRGs
were stained with rabbit anti-activation transcription factor 3 (ATF3, 1:1000; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Binding sites were visualized with species matched
goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or goat anti-mouse
antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (both at 1:500, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Control sections had the primary antibody omitted. Images were acquired with a Leica TCS
SP5 confocal system (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany); z-stacks were
obtained and images processed with LAS AF software (Leica Microsystems GmbH,
Wetzlar, Germany). All reported findings were observed in multiple sections in at least 3
animals per condition.

Western blot analysis for AMPA receptor subunits—Rats were deeply anesthetized
and perfused with room temperature saline. Spinal cords were harvested and the dorsal half
of the lumbar enlargement dissected. Tissue was immediately frozen in extraction lysis
buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 nM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 3% SDS).
Protein concentrations were determined and Western blot analysis performed. Samples were
loaded on a Nu-Page 4–12% Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in MOPS
running buffer and transferred onto a single nitrocellulose membrane. Antibodies against the
pAKT (ser473, 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) and GluA1- and
GluA2- AMPA receptor subunits were from rabbit (1:1000, Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA).
Beta-actin was used as a loading control (Sigma, St. Louis, USA). The membrane was
stripped following each analysis. Immunoblots were scanned and a densitometric analysis
performed using ImageJ software (U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland,
USA).

Author Manuscript

Statistical analysis—Graph Pad Prism 4.0 (GPP 4.0, GraphPad Software, Inc., San
Diego, CA) was used for statistical analyses and graphs. Data distribution was tested with
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test and by visual inspection of data histograms. For non-normally
distributed values of the human qRT-PCR results, data were expressed as medians and
quartiles and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test Spearman’s rho were used for
analysis. Descriptive patient data were reported as median and range (minimum to
maximum value). All other data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean
(SEM). Two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc testing were
used to assess statistical significance in behavioral experiments. One-way ANOVA followed
by Tukey’s post hoc testing was performed for rat qRT-PCR data, place-escape avoidance
and the Hargreaves test. Student’s t-tests were performed for reporter assays and Westernblot data. Statistical significance was accepted with p<0.05.

Results
Basic description of the patient cohort

Author Manuscript

We included 81 patients with neuropathies of different etiology. The study cohort had a
median age of 66 years (range 33–84 years) and consisted of 55 men (median age: 66 years,
range 33–84 years) and 26 women (median age: 67 years, range 47–84 years). Clinical
characteristics of the cohort and diagnostic subgroups are summarized in Table 1. In 23/81
(28%) patients an inflammatory neuropathy was diagnosed (CIDP, vasculitic neuropathy,
PIAN, paraproteinemic neuropathy), while in 24/81 patients (30%) neuropathy was of noninflammatory origin (diabetic, hereditary, CIAP). In 34/81 cases (42%) the etiology of the
neuropathy was unclear. Forty-two (51%) patients had a painful neuropathy (i.e. current pain
intensity ≥3, NRS) compared to 39 patients (49%) with neuropathy without pain.

Healthy controls

Author Manuscript

The control group for WBC analysis of miR-132-3p consisted of 26 men and 4 women, with
a median age of 56.5 years (range 38 to 69 years). None of the controls reported any
ongoing infectious disease, pain or neuropathy.
Expression of miR-132-3p in polyneuropathy patients
We found that patients with polyneuropathies collectively had higher miR-132-3p levels than
healthy controls (p<0.001, Figure 1A). There was no difference in miR-132-3p expression in
WBCs when comparing between subsets of inflammatory versus non-inflammatory or
painful versus non-painful polyneuropathies.

Author Manuscript

In contrast, expression of miR-132-3p was higher in sural nerve specimens of patients with
painful neuropathies, i.e. NRS ≥3 compared to patients with painless neuropathies, NRS<3
(p<0.001, Figure 1B). We additionally tested the group of patients with NRS=0 (i.e.
painless) and NRS>0 (i.e. painful) and observed that patients with pain had higher
miR-132-3p expression than patients without pain (p=0.0134). We then performed a
correlation analysis between NRS values and miR-132-3p levels and found a correlation
between NRS values and miR-132-3p levels (Spearman’s rho; r=0.3274, p=0.02).
Interestingly, pain was associated with higher miR-132-3p expression in inflammatory, but
not in non-inflammatory neuropathies (1.1 Fold change, Figure 1C). Disease duration (<3
versus ≥3 years) had no influence on miR-132-3p expression in sural nerve. There was no
sex related difference in miR-132-3p expression in sural nerve biopsy specimens with
neuropathies (p=0.08). In addition, stratification for painful and painless neuropathies did
not reveal sex specific expression differences (p=0.4; data not shown).

Author Manuscript

Of note, no difference in miR-132-5p, a second splice variant of miR-132, was observed in
either WBC or sural nerve specimens (p>0.05; data not shown). We therefore focused
exclusively on miR-132-3p.
SNI increases miR-132-3p expression in rat spinal cord and DRG

Author Manuscript

We measured miR-132-3p expression in dorsal spinal cord, DRG, and sural nerve specimens
after SNI or sham surgery in rats without catheters on post-surgical days 3 and 10 (Figure 2).
On day 3, dorsal spinal cord tissue ipsilateral to the SNI was no different than contralateral
miR-132-3p levels (p=0.7561), but tended to have lower levels following sham surgery
(p=0.06). At this time, rats did not exhibit consistent pain behavior. However, on day 10
post-surgery when a profound and persistent increase in mechanical withdrawal threshold
was present, spinal miR-132-3p expression was highest in ipsilateral SNI tissue. At both
time points, expression of miR-132-3p in DRGs ipsilateral to the SNI was higher than DRGs
ipsilateral to sham surgery or naïve tissues. Despite the fact that the sensory nerve cell
bodies of the injured fibers showed a 6–7 fold increase in miR-132-3p compared to naive,
sural nerves displayed no difference among ipsilateral SNI, contralateral SNI and shamoperated tissue at either time point (p>0.9). Thus the nerve injury elicited an increase of
miR-132-3p in sensory nerves in both neuropathy patients and SNI rats, but the distribution
was different.

Gene expression of miR-132-3p in DRGs and spinal cord of naïve animals was not different
than that seen in sham operated rats 10 days post-surgery. There was no difference in
miR-132-3p expression between tissue ipsilateral to SNI in rats with (13 days-post surgery)
or without (10 days) catheters (Figure 2 B, C and D, E respectively). Daily i.t. administration
of a miR-132-3p antagonist to SNI animals, starting on day 10, reversed the ipsilateral spinal
up-regulation of gene expression by day 13, this was not observed following Scr injections.
In the same animals, antagonist injections also reversed the ipsilateral DRG up-regulation of
miR-132-3p 13 days post SNI (p=0.02), however, unlike the spinal tissue, Scr injection
caused a down-regulation in the DRG. This was an unexpected observation and could have
multiple explanations in addition to direct off-target effects, such as unwanted protein
binding due to length and polarity of the Scr, as previously reported (Stein, 1996, 2001).
SNI-induced mechanical allodynia is reversed by miR-132-3p antagonism

Author Manuscript

Baseline mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds did not differ among the various treatment
groups. We started with a high dose (5 μg) of a miR-132-3p inhibitor, Scr or vehicle (10 μl,
i-Fect™ transfection agent) to determine if these oligonucleotides produced toxic effects.
Neither of the drugs led to any observable impairment or discomfort in naive animals. We
then proceeded with the i.t. treatment paradigm of 5-, 2- or 1 μg anti-miR-132-3p or 5 μg Scr
given as bolus injections on three consecutive days, starting on day 10 after SNI. At this
time, all animals exhibited a pronounced allodynia with withdrawal thresholds of less than
9.80 mN (1 g). Only the 5 μg dose reversed the SNI-induced allodynia (p<0.001, Figure 3A),
which lasted until at least day 18 (p<0.001, Figure 3A). Figure 3B represents the efficacy of
miR-132-3p antagonism in a small subset of animals that were tested more frequently (n=3–
4/group). Animals showed a gradual increase in mechanical withdrawal thresholds after each
injection (day 11, 12, 13) lasting for up to 7 days after the last injection, after which, pain
behavior began to reemerge (p<0.001, Figure 3B). Treatment with the control Scr oligo was
without effect (p>0.9; Figure 3A and B).
Spinal miR-132-3p antagonism causes loss of pain aversion in the PEAP test

Figure 3C depicts the PEAP chamber with its two testing areas. On average, naïve rats spent
20–30% of the time in the light side of the chamber, regardless if they were stimulated with
the von Frey hair filament or not (Figure 3D). Following SNI, this pattern changed and
animals spent 60–70% of the time on the light side. This reflects the increased aversion
produced by left paw stimulation after SNI. In contrast, following three days of antimiR-132-3p treatment, time spent in the light area decreased to approximately 20%. This is
similar to what is seen for sham-operated rats, i.e. the antagonist reversed the aversive nature
of the left paw stimulus (p<0.001, Figure 3D). Behavior of SNI animals treated with the Scr
control did not differ from SNI/vehicle animals (p>0.9).
Intrathecal injection of miR-132-3p mimetic causes mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia
Baseline mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds did not differ among the various treatment
groups. A synthetic miR-132-3p mimetic was administered i.t. for three consecutive days
and mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds (Figure 4A) were determined. A dose of 8 μg
miR-132-3p mimetic induced vocalization after injection, motor weakness of one or both
hindlimbs, and limping that was readily apparent before the third injection. Animals still

exhibited sensitivity to paw stimulation with von Frey hair filaments. Mean mechanical
thresholds dropped to below 49 mN (5 g) for treatment groups given 5 and 8 μg mimetic and
remained depressed through day 7, there was however a transient increase in threshold on
day 3. Lower doses of 3 and 1 μg did not result in behavioral changes after three injections
and testing was discontinued. We also examined thermal latencies in animals given mimetic
on the day after their last injection. These results mirrored those seen for mechanical
thresholds on day 1 in that only the higher doses of 8 μg and 5 μg resulted in thermal
withdrawal latency different from Scr-treated animals (Figure 4B).
Exogenous miR-132-3p administration leads to spinal microglia activation

Author Manuscript

Injection of 8 μg miR-132-3p mimetic led to increased Iba1 expression at the site of the
catheter tip and the entire spinal cord section compared to the injection of Scr-control
(Figure 5A, B). In parallel, we observed staining for MAC387 positive cells indicative of
peripheral macrophage infiltration exclusively at the catheter site. No such infiltration was
found in Scr-injected rats (see supplemental Methods and Figure 1). Staining for GFAP did
not reveal any obvious difference from control animals (data not shown). Interestingly, we
also did not observe an appreciable number of ATF3 positive DRG neurons in animals
injected with mimetic (data not shown).
MiR-132-3p targets and decreases spinal AMPA receptor subunit GluA1

Author Manuscript

We verified that miR-132-3p targets GluA1 mRNA in a luciferase assay (see supplemental
Figure 2). To confirm our hypothesis that miR-132-3p not only targets GluA1 mRNA, but
also decreases its protein expression, we performed Western blots for GluA1 in whole tissue
homogenates of dorsal spinal cord from rats that had received three daily bolus injections of
5 μg miR-132-3p mimetic, tissue was collected the day after the last injection (Figure 6A
and B). Western blots for GluA2 and phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) were also
performed to look at the specificity of the mimetic effect. Neither GluA2 nor AKT was
predicted by our algorithms to be a direct target of miR-132-3p. Injection of synthetic
miR-132-3p decreased the expression of GluA1 when compared to naïve animals as
predicted (GluA1; p<0.05). Interestingly, in the same samples, GluA2 levels increased in
comparison to naïve animals (GluA2; p<0.05). No changes in spinal cord dorsal horn pAKT
levels were observed (data not shown), despite the presence of pain behavior.
SNI causes spinal up-regulation of AMPA receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA2

Author Manuscript

We next measured the expression of spinal AMPA receptor subunits after SNI. We
performed Western blots for GluA1 and GluA2 in whole tissue homogenates of the dorsal
spinal cord harvested 10 days after surgery. Figure 6C shows the up-regulation of GluA1
after SNI (3.5 fold) compared to sham animals (GluA1, p<0.05). In the same samples,
GluA2 levels also increased by 2.5 fold over sham (p<0.05, Figure 6C and D).

Discussion
miRNAs have a vital role in post-transcriptional regulation, are widely expressed throughout
the brain, are regulated by neuronal activity and some, including miR-132 are thought to be
necessary for neuronal plasticity required for memory consolidation and pathological pain

(Elramah et al., 2014; Soreq and Wolf, 2011). For example, overexpression of hippocampal
miR-132 increased local excitatory postsynaptic currents and impaired learning and memory
processes (Edbauer et al., 2010), and induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) resulted in a
delayed up-regulation of miR-132 (Wibrand et al., 2012; Wibrand et al., 2010). In contrast,
low levels of miR-132 enhanced cognitive capacity (Hansen et al., 2013; Hansen et al.,
2010). Thus, given the many parallels between memory consolidation and (Basbaum et al.,
2009), pathological regulation of miR-132 might modulate the development of chronic pain.

Despite recent advances, chronic neuropathic pain remains a major challenge for clinicians
and pre-clinical scientists. There is an urgent demand for the development of specific
mechanism-based therapies. Using a comprehensive approach combining patient data with
behavioral and molecular methods in a clinically relevant animal model of neuropathic pain,
this study showed for the first time that chronic neuropathic pain is associated with
dysregulation of miR-132-3p. Disease specific aberrant miRNA expression signatures have
previously been reported, e.g. in blood of cancer patients (Calin and Croce, 2006) and other
disorders (Cogswell et al., 2008; Gillardon et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011;
Zhang et al., 2010). Furthermore, several recent studies associated circulating miRNAs with
chronic pain conditions such as osteoarthritis (Beyer et al., 2015), rheumatoid arthritis
(Pauley et al., 2008), CRPS (Orlova et al., 2011), fibromyalgia syndrome (Bjersing et al.,
2013), and migraine attacks (Andersen et al., 2016), thus potentially enabling patient
stratification and disease characterization. Importantly, MiR-132 found in a subset of CRPS
patients correlated with expression of inflammatory and immune-related markers (Orlova et
al., 2011). We presently show that peripheral neuropathies are associated with an increase of
miR-132-3p in WBCs and that painful inflammatory neuropathies in particular are
associated with increased miR-132-3p in patient sural nerves. Although all fold-changes
found for miR-132-3p expression were comparatively small, Joilin et al. reported that twothirds of hippocampal miRNAs in the rat differentially expressed following LTP-inducing
stimulation, including miR-132-3p, showed less than a 1 fold-change and only 4/65 showed
more than a 2-fold change (Joilin et al., 2014). These modest changes appear to be typical of
studies examining LTP-induced changes in miRNA (Ryan et al., 2011; Ryan et al., 2012;
Wibrand et al., 2010). Given the parallels between spinal and hippocampal LTP, this level of
spinal change is not unexpected. These findings suggest that neuropathies may either alter
systemic and peripheral nerve miR-132-3p levels, or that specific changes in miR-132-3p
expression may actively contribute to pain. We thus set out to study this phenomenon in a
well-established animal model of chronic neuropathic pain.

Author Manuscript

Our data indicate that spinal miR-132-3p expression has a biphasic response after SNI, a
semi-acute (day 3) tendency to decrease followed by a much later (day 10) significant
increase at a time when pain behavior was well established. This resembles the pattern of
hippocampal miR-132 expression following induction of LTP (Joilin et al., 2014; Wibrand et
al., 2012; Wibrand et al., 2010). This early decrease was also observed for miR-132
following SNI in mice (Zhang et al., 2015), however in these experiments levels of the miR
were still below basal on day 7, albeit higher than they were on day 3. This discrepancy
could be due to differences in species, time point on the biphasic curve or other technical
factors. In our experiments, miR-132-3p expression in the DRG was up-regulated at both
time points implying an ongoing role for miR-132-3p in the regulation of SNI-induced painExp Neurol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2017 September 01.

related signals from the periphery to the spinal cord. Having demonstrated that spinal
miR-132-3p was elevated in SNI animals with well-established pain behavior, the questions
became, did miR-132-3p alter endogenous expression of the miRNA? and, Was it necessary
for the expression of the pain behavior? Intrathecal administration of the miR-132-3p
inhibitor 13 days after SNI, reduces its endogenous expression levels. Administration of the
Scr control was without effect on both the pain behavior and the SNI-induced increased
miR-132-3p expression in the spinal cord as expected, but surprisingly inhibited upregulation of miR-132-3p in the DRG. This latter effect could be due to off-target effects.
Importantly, the antagonist reversed mechanical allodynia and pain aversion in SNI animals,
thus linking spinal expression levels of miR-132-3p with pain behavior. Intrathecal
administration of miR-132-3p mimetic probably resulting in spinal levels above the
“physiological values” produced by SNI induced long lasting mechanical and thermal
hyperalgesia. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that increased miR-132-3p
expression is not only associated with human neuropathic pain but is also necessary for
maintenance of rodent neuropathic pain behavior and aversion, via as yet unknown
mechanisms.

In chronic pain, spinal neuroinflammation is often characterized by activation of glia cells,
infiltration of leukocytes and increased production of inflammatory mediators (Calvo et al.,
2012; Taves et al., 2013). Interestingly, spinal administration of exogenous miR-132-3p led
to pronounced microglial (Iba1) activation throughout the dorsal horn. Of particular interest,
the macrophage marker MAC387 was positive in the mass at the catheter tip, but not in the
remainder of the dorsal horn, suggesting a role for miR-132-3p in the recruitment of
peripheral macrophages (see supplemental Figure 1). Indeed, miR-132-3p has been shown to
be involved in both inflammatory cascades and immune cell infiltration (Marques-Rocha et
al., 2015; Taganov et al., 2006). At present we cannot differentiate between the relative
contributions to the pain response of miR-132-3p activation of pro-nociceptive signal
transduction cascades and an artifact caused by the mass-induced spinal cord compression.

“Single NeurimmiRs affect a pathway of inter-related transcripts, all involved in a cellular
process, rather than single proteins (Soreq and Wolf, 2011)”. As stated above, miRNAs
directly induce down-regulation of target molecules (Huttenhofer and Schattner, 2006).
After reviewing several target prediction algorithms for downstream molecules involved in
spinal sensitization we chose to measure GluA1. This was probably a mis-step on our part,
as down-regulation of GluA1 would be expected to reduce pain behavior (Hartmann et al.,
2004). We found that i.t. injection of the miR-132-3p mimetic, decreased levels of GluA1,
but resulted in increased spinal levels of GluA2. In contrast, SNI, the more physiologic pain
model, up-regulated miR-132-3p, GluA1 and GluA2. At first glance these effects on pain
and GluA1 are contradictory. However, Cheng et al. reported that miR-132 also alters
cellular activity by targeting, presumably down-regulating, K+ channels (Cheng et al., 2007).
Moreover, miR-132 is predicted to be upstream of the glutamate transporter GLT-1.
Neuropathic pain is associated with downregulation of GLT-1, a subsequent deficit of
glutamate clearance, and enhanced glutamatergic transmission (Ji et al., 2013). Thus, it is
plausible that injection of mimetic could decrease GluA1 while still producing pain
behavior. Ten days post-SNI, ipsilateral spinal tissue has up-regulated levels of miR-132-3p.
However, SNI induces multiple effects beyond miR-132-3p, including induction of other

miRNAs and of pro-nociceptive factors some of which may induce increased GluA1. The
algorithm by which SNI results in up-regulation of GluA1 is complex as many neuronal
miRNAs are postulated to participate in both feed-forward and feedback homeostatic loops
(Tsang et al., 2007). The final outcome of GluA1 expression changes is dependent on the
sum total of all of these factors. While the exact mechanisms remain elusive, the observation
is solid and will hopefully lead to further experiments.

Author Manuscript

Our study has several limitations, miRNA expression in WBC was only assessed in patients
and not in rats and we did not test downstream target expression in patient samples. It could
have been more illuminating if we had examined other downstream targets in the rats such
as GLT-1, which were more likely to have shown the same changes following mimetic
administration and SNI. Our findings furthermore raise the question as to whether the
increased peripheral miR-132-3p in WBC of patients is directly involved in the
pathophysiology of pain, possibly via release of sensitizing agents, e.g. pro-inflammatory
cytokines, infiltration of macrophages into the central nervous system or some combination
of the two (Figure 7). Our study cannot explain whether increased miR-132-3p expression in
WBC is the cause or consequence of peripheral neuropathies and if peripheral nerve injury
induces the same increase in WBC miRNA expression in rats as it does in neuropathy
patients. It does however address the fact that neuropathies are not solely restricted to
peripheral nerves, but involve changes in systemic miRNA expression, possibly via feedback
loops between the immune- and central nervous systems. Furthermore, it provides
interesting insights into the translational aspect of miR-132-3p in the pathophysiology of
chronic neuropathic pain.

Conclusion
Author Manuscript

Taken together these findings imply that aberrant neural miR-132-3p expression is
associated with human neuropathic pain, and that in animals targeted antagonism of
miR-132-3p results in dose-dependent reversal of pain behavior while miR-132-3p mimicry
results in a dose-dependent induction of pain behavior allowing us to designate miR-132-3p
as a pro-nociceptive miRNA in our study. Importantly, alterations in miRNA levels may be
indicative of their functional involvement in pain pathophysiology, and miRNA-based
diagnostics and therapeutics might have the advantage of targeting multiple pain-associated
genes simultaneously. However, administration of miR-132-3p elsewhere to different tissues
or by different routes could have different effects and thus more detailed work is necessary
to better understand the molecular pathways in neuropathic pain.

miR-132-3p gene expression in patients with polyneuropathies. A) Bar graph indicates that
miR-132-3p expression was higher in white blood cells of patients with polyneuropathy of
different etiologies compared to controls (n=30/group). Data represents relative miR-132-3p
expression normalized to controls. ***p < 0.001 B) Gene expression of miR-132-3p was
also higher in patients with painful neuropathies (n=25) compared to patients with painless
neuropathies (n=23;). C) Pain was associated with higher miR-132-3p expression in
inflammatory and non-inflammatory neuropathies, when sub-grouped based on the
diagnosis. Y-axis in panels B & C are in arbitrary units. Data are expressed as median values
with upper and lower 25% percentiles indicated; Mann Whitney U-comparisons;

miR-132-3p gene expression analysis after SNI. panels A–C: Expression of miR-132-3p on
day 3 and 10 after SNI or sham surgery. A) Sural nerve expression did not change at either
time point. B) On post-operative day 3, spinal cord miR-132-3p expression levels did not
change in SNI-operated animals, but increased on day 10 compared to the contralateral side
and sham C) expression of miR-132-3p was higher in DRGs of SNI animals compared to
naïve and sham operated rats at both times. panels D & E: Relative gene expression of
endogenous miR-132-3p in spinal cord and DRG after i.t. administration of antagonist or
Scr. D) Spinal expression of miR-132-3p tended to increase 13 days after SNI when
compared to naïve. Injection of 5 μg antagonist (Antag) reversed this tendency and resulted
in a significant decline in miR-132-3p levels, while injection of 5 μg Scr had no effect. E) In
DRGs of the same animals, miR-132-3p was up-regulated after SNI and decreased to naïve
levels after i.t. antagonism. Injection of Scr also reversed the SNI-induced increase. Y-axis is
in arbitrary units. Insert refers to panels A–C only. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM 1way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc tests; **p<0.01, *p<0.05; n=3–6

miR-132-3p antagonism reverses pain behavior. A) Mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds
in SNI animals before and after i.t. injection of miR-132-3p antagonist. The high dose (5 μg)
reverses pain behavior in SNI rats for at least 7 days (n=6–12). B) Each successive 5 μg
miR-132-3p injection of inhibitor resulted in progressively more anti-allodynia on the
following days, this lasted for at least 5 days after the last injection (n=3–4). C) Schematic
of the PEAP testing chamber. D) Percent of time animals spend within the light side of the
test chamber 13 days after SNI. SNI increases the amount of time spent in the light side,
compared to sham-operated animals, this was reversed by the antagonist, but not by Scr
(n=8–12). 2-way ANOVA comparisons with post-hoc Bonferroni corrections (A&B), and 1way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc tests (D); ***p<0.001, **p<0.01.

miR-132-3p as a potential mediator of CNS-immune modulation involved in neuropathic
pain. Following peripheral or central immune insults, immune cell (white blood cells;
macrophages) changes in miR-132-3p levels might influence neuronal functions, whether
directly by suppressing genes within neurons or indirectly by influencing the functioning of
immune or supporting glial cells (i.e. microglia) or vice versa. Selective high-miR-132-3p
expressing immune cells (e.g. macrophages) presumably infiltrate the DRG and sensitize
peripheral neurons in addition to releasing pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. cytokines and
chemokines). Consequent changes in the expression of miR-132-3p alter both neuron–glia
interactions and neuronal functions, affecting plasticity, neurotransmission, and possibly
leading to neuropathic pain. Spinal administration of miR-132-3p antagonists alleviates pain
behavior following peripheral insults. Pathological events and processes are shown in red,
black dots represent miR-132-3p. Abbreviations: MF- macrophages; Chem- chemokine;
CNS- central nervous system; Cyt- cytokine; PA- primary afferent; PNS- peripheral nervous
system; WBC- white blood cells.
