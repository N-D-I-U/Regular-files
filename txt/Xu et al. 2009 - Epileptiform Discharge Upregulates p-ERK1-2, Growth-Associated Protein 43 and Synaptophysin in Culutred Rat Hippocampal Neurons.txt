Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, ERK1/2 is activated by phosphorylation (p-ERK1/2) during
environmental stress such as epileptiform discharge. We investigated the role of ERK1/2 in abnormal
axon growth and synapse reorganization in cultured neurons displaying epileptiform activity.
The cultured neurons displaying epileptiform activity were treated with magnesium-free
extracellular ﬂuid for 3 h and monitored epileptiform discharges using whole-cell patch clamp. Two
study groups, neurons displaying epileptiform activity and the same neurons treated with ERK1/2
inhibitor U0126, were studied at six time points, 0 min, 30 min, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h following
discharge. The expressions of p-ERK1/2, C-fos, growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) and
synaptophysin (SYP), as markers of axon growth and synapse reorganization, were investigated by
double-label immunoﬂuorescence and western blotting.
In the neurons displaying epileptiform activity, p-ERK1/2 was detected immediately following
discharge, and expression peaked at 30 min. The expression of C-fos, GAP-43 and SYP followed the same
pattern as p-ERK1/2. In the treated group, p-ERK1/2 was inhibited completely, and C-fos, GAP-43 and SYP
were reduced.
These ﬁndings indicate that epileptiform discharge activates ERK1/2 which regulates C-fos in
cultured neurons displaying epileptiform activity, and this cascade may upregulate GAP-43 and SYP to
contribute to axon growth and synapse reorganization to potentiate epileptic activities.

1. Introduction
Epilepsy is a clinical syndrome caused by abnormal discharge of
a high degree of synchronization of neurons in the brain. The
process whereby normal brain tissue undergoes an injury that
produces permanent plasticity changes that lead to the occurrence
of spontaneous recurrent epileptic seizures, is called epileptogenesis. To study some of the molecular events involved in
epileptogenesis, hippocampal neuronal cultures were exposed to
3 h of magnesium-free media that resulted in a permanent
alteration in the neuronal culture physiology as evidence by the
development of a permanent ‘‘epileptiform’’ phenotype.1,2 Neurons displaying epileptiform activity provide a useful culture
model for investigating the molecular changes associated with
epilepsy.
Mossy ﬁber sprouting, a phenomenon characterized by
abnormal axon growth and synapse reorganization, is one of the

pathological hallmarks associated with mesial temporal lobe
epilepsy and occurs via unknown mechanisms. In general, both
GAP-43 and SYP are considered to be markers of mossy ﬁber
sprouting. GAP-43, a neuro-axonal growth protein, is upregulated
in neural tissues during development and regeneration3 and is
elevated in injured neurons following ischemic damage.4 SYP is a
calcium binding protein expressed on presynaptic vesicles that
plays an important role in synaptogenesis,5 is directly correlated
with the density of synapses, and is thought to be a marker for
synapse reorganization.6,7 Extracellular signal-regulated protein
kinase (ERK1/2), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) family, is abundantly expressed in the brain,8 especially in
the neuronal cell body and dendrites. ERK1/2 acts as part of a
signaling cascade activated in response to extracellular cues such
as neurotransmitters or neurotrophic factors and inﬂuences
synapse reorganization, axonal growth, neuronal excitability and
transcription factor activation. ERK1/2 activation occurs when it is
phosphorylated by MAP kinase and ERK activator kinase (MEK1/
2)9 and recent reports have found phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) expressed in an animal epilepsy model.10 The transcription factor C-fos, a target for ERK1/2,11 is upregulated following

seizures and participates in the formation of epileptogenic foci. In
addition to inducing transcription factor activation in the nucleus,
p-ERK1/2 activates cytoplasmic substrates, including MAP2 and
MBP, thereby contributing to cytoskeletal remodeling and synapse
reorganization.12,13
To better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms
underlying the process of epileptogenesis, both function and surface
expression of GAP-43 and SYP were evaluated, and experimental
techniques to modulate p-ERK1/2 and C-fos were employed to study
the contribution of this cellular process toward the induction and
maintenance of spontaneous recurrent epileptic seizures in this
model. The results demonstrate that epileptic activity leads to
increase in p-ERK1/2 and C-fos that contributes to the expression of
GAP-43 and SYP in the hippocampal culture model.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Preparation of neuronal epileptiform discharge model
Neonatal Wistar rats (<24 h old) were obtained from the
Experimental Animal Center of Chongqing Medical University, CQ,
China. After ether inhalation anesthesia, the brain was exposed and
the hippocampus was carefully isolated under a microscope
(Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), taking care to remove the meninges and
superﬁcial blood vessels. The hippocampus was minced in ice cold
D-Hank’s medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), then incubated in
ﬁve volumes of 0.125% parenzyme (Sigma) at 37 8C, 5% CO2 for
30 min. The digestion was stopped by adding an equal volume of
growth medium composed of Neurobasal medium (Gibco,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), B-27 (2%; Gibco), L-glutamine (0.5 mM; Gibco)
and FBS (0.5%; Gibco). Following centrifugation at 1000 rpm for
5 min, the supernatant was discarded and fresh growth medium
was added. The tissue was dissociated and the cell suspension was
ﬁltered through a 200-mesh cell-sieve. Cells were diluted to a
concentration of 5  105 cells per ml and plated on coverslips
coated with polylysine (0.1%; Gibco) and maintained at 37 8C, 5%
CO2. 24 h after plating, medium was changed to maintenance
medium (Neurobasal medium, B-27 (2%)), and L-glutamine
(0.5 mM). Half the volume of maintenance medium was changed
every 3 days. After 9 days in vitro, the following was performed
using previously established procedures.2 Brieﬂy, cells were placed
in magnesium-free media (145 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM
HEPES, 2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, and 0.002 mM glycine, pH 7.3,
and adjusted to 325 mOsm with sucrose) for 3 h and epileptiform
activity was recorded with whole-cell patch clamp techniques.2
For patch clamp recording, cultures were placed on the stage of an
inverted microscope (Nikon) and continuously perfused with baserecording solution containing 25 mM 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, 10 mM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, 145 mM
NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.3), 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM
CaCl2, and 10 mM glucose. The osmolarity was adjusted to
325 mOsm with sucrose. Patch electrodes (2–4 MV resistance)
with pipette solution containing 140 mM CsCl, 1 mM MgCl2,
10 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), and 1.1 mM EGTA were used and the
solution was adjusted to 310 mOsm with sucrose. In whole-cell
current-clamp mode (at zero holding current), the membrane
potential was measured immediately. And then neuronal recording was performed with an Axopatch 1D ampliﬁer. Usually, wholecell recording state could be maintained for a few minutes.

experiment. Neurons displaying epileptiform activity were incubated to magnesium-free medium for 3 h, returned to maintenance medium, and examined at the indicated times. U0126treated neurons were incubated in magnesium-free medium and
U0126 (10 mM) for 3 h, then returned to maintenance medium and
examined at the corresponding times. P-ERK1/2 and C-fos were
detected absolutely by immunoﬂuorescence. Brieﬂy, cells were
washed with PBS for 3–5 min, ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
30 min, washed with PBS 3–5 min, treated with 0.5% Triton X-100
(Gibco) for 20 min at room temperature, washed with PBS 3–
5 min, and blocked with 10% goat serum for 20 min at room
temperature. Cells were incubated with mouse polyclonal anti-pERK1/2 and rabbit polyclonal anti-C-fos primary antibodies (1:100,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) overnight at 4 8C.
Secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse FITC and goat anti-rabbit
TRITC, 1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were applied for 2 h at
room temperature, and washed with PBS for 3–5 min. For each
sample, photos were collected using a laser scanning confocal
microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).
2.3. Western blotting
The levels of SYP and GAP-43 in both control and treated groups
were measured by western blotting at the same time points
described above. Cells were washed with cold PBS, collected by
centrifugation and lysed in cell lysis buffer (100 ml) containing
Tris–HCl (50 mM; pH 8.0), NaCl (150 mM), EDTA (1 mM), EGTA
(1 mM), Triton X-100 (1%), phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (1 mM),
and freshly added protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem, San
Diego, CA, USA) on ice for 30 min. 50 mg of protein was resolved on
a 10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
(PVDF) membrane, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with
5% nonfat dried milk in PBS. Membranes were incubated with
primary antibodies (rabbit anti-SYP and mouse anti-GAP-43 at
1:200 or mouse anti-b-actin at 1:2500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
in blocking buffer. The blots were washed 3–10 min each with PBS
plus Tween-20 (0.1%) and incubated with the appropriate diluted
HRP-tagged secondary antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed according
to the manufacturer’s instructions with Super Signal West Pico
Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), and
visualized with exposure to X-ray ﬁlm. Band intensities were
calculated with the Gelwork 4.1 image analysis system.
2.4. Statistics
Signiﬁcant differences between experimental groups were
determined with the Student’s t-test. Values are presented as
mean  S.E. P values<0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

2.2. Double-label immunoﬂuorescence
Wells of cultured neurons were randomly divided into either
control, epileptiform, or U0126-treated groups. U0126(Sigma)
is used as an inhibitor of ERK1/2 activation. Control neurons
were treated with normal cell culture medium throughout the

3. Results
3.1. Epileptiform discharge of neuron
Action potentials were recorded by patch clamp in neurons
cultured in normal maintenance medium for the duration of the
experiment (Fig. 1A). Recordings from neurons that were cultured
in magnesium-free medium for 3 h manifested larger and longer
duration action potentials. These action potentials progressed into
continuous tonic high-frequency burst discharges that resolved
into recurrent epileptiform discharges (Fig. 1B).
3.2. Activation of ERK1/2 cascade
Immunoﬂuorescence double labeling found signiﬁcant differences in the expression of p-ERK1/2 and C-fos between of
untreated and U0126-treated neurons displaying epileptiform
activity. In control neurons, C-fos was detected in the nucleus (A),
and p-ERK1/2 was predominantly detected in the cytoplasm (B).
Increased levels of both p-ERK1/2 and C-fos were observed in
epiliptiform neurons at 0 min, with expression peaking 30 min
after returning the neurons to maintenance medium (Fig. 2, 30 min
(model) A and B). In U0126-treated neurons, p-ERK1/2 expression
was inhibited completely (Fig. 2, 0 min (U0126) B), and C-fos
expression was partially attenuated, with its staining remaining
constant at each time point (Fig. 2, 0 min (U0126) A). We selected
20 neurons at random for each time point and compared the
absolute ﬂuorescence intensity of C-fos staining between the
different experimental groups. Statistical analysis with Student’s ttests found signiﬁcant differences between these groups at all six
time points. Values are presented as mean  S.E. (X̄  s) and P values
were <0.01.
3.3. Expression of SYP and GAP-43
We measured the protein levels of SYP and GAP-43 in untreated
and U0126-treated neurons displaying epileptiform activity by
western blotting. Both SYP (Fig. 3, Con) and GAP-43 (Fig. 4, Con)
were detected in control neurons. In untreated neurons displaying
epileptiform activity, both SYP and GAP-43 were detected at the
ﬁrst time point analyzed after being returned to maintenance
medium (Fig. 3, 0 min and Fig. 4, 0 min) and changes in their
expression patterns were similar to p-ERK1/2, with expression

683

peaking at 30 min. In contrast, the expression of SYP and GAP-43
was signiﬁcantly reduced across all time points in U0126-treated
neurons displaying epileptiform activity (Figs. 3 and 4 0 min–24 h).
The differences in the relative expression levels of SYP and GAP-43
between these groups were found to be signiﬁcant at all six time
points examined. Values are presented as mean  S.E. (X̄  s), and P
values were <0.01.
4. Discussion
Although it is a common contributor to human morbidity, the
pathological mechanisms involved in epilepsy are complex and not
yet understood. Many researchers have reported that mossy ﬁber
sprouting plays an important role in the pathology of epilepsy, and
activation of the ERK1/2 cascade has been observed in animal
models of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy,9,14 although the relationship between these changes remains unresolved. The aim of our
study was to clarify the role of ERK1/2 in abnormal axon growth
and synapse reorganization following neuronal epileptiform
discharges.
Taken together, our results suggest that p-ERK1/2 induces the
expression of GAP-43 and SYP, whose gene products are associated
with dendritic and synapse growth and reorganization, after
epileptiform discharge of cultured rat hippocampal neurons.
Inhibition of the p-ERK1/2 pathway with the speciﬁc inhibitor
U0126, resulted in signiﬁcantly decreased levels of SYP and GAP43, suggesting that the ERK1/2 signaling pathway may participate
in abnormal axon growth and synapse reorganization by virtue of
regulating these genes. Since both abnormal axon growth and
synapse reorganization are closely related to mossy ﬁber sprouting, which is an important pathological component of spontaneous
recurrent epileptic seizures, we believe that the ERK1/2 signaling
pathway may have an important role in the occurrence and
development of spontaneous recurrent epileptic seizures.
Although the activation of ERK1/2 that accompanies the
appearance of epileptiform activity suggests a cause–effect
relationship between the ERK pathway and epileptiform synchronization,10,15 there are differing opinions about the role of ERK1/2
in the pathogenesis of mossy ﬁber sprouting. A previous study
concluded that both the ERK1/2 and CREB signaling pathways are
highly activated during mossy ﬁber organization.16 In contrast,
Chen et al.17 found that inhibiting NR2B-containing NMDARs,
whose activation led to ERK1/2 phosphorylation, had no effects on

epileptogenesis or mossy ﬁber sprouting. However, in the present
study, p-ERK1/2, C-fos, GAP-43 and SYP were all upregulated in a
similar time-course in neurons that had been exposed for 3 h to
magnesium-free extracellular ﬂuid. Importantly, inhibition of pERK1/2 with U0126 resulted in the reduced expression of the other
proteins. Upregulation of C-fos expression is suggestive of the
ERK1/2 cascade being activated, which was conﬁrmed by a recent
report.12 Moreover, the expression of SYP and GAP-43 also
correlates with the activation of the ERK1/2 cascade after neuronal
epileptiform discharge. Our results demonstrate that the ERK1/2
pathway does indeed induce the expression of GAP-43 and SYP
after epileptiform discharge of neurons; in other words, this
suggests that activation of this pathway correlates with axon
growth and synapse reorganization. Mossy ﬁber sprouting, an
abnormal axon growth phenomenon, is one of the most important
pathological changes after epileptic seizures and is associated with
recurrent epileptic seizures.14 Adachi and colleagues have shown
that ERK1/2 is activated in human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.9
Therefore, we conclude that ERK1/2 regulates abnormal axon
growth and synapse reorganization after epileptic seizures via
regulation of GAP-43 and SYP expression, respectively. Our data do
not detect mossy ﬁber sprouting in the epileptic neurons,
therefore, a direct relationship between ERK1/2 and mossy ﬁber
sprouting was not found. However, this work provides important
clues about the signal transduction underlying recurrent epileptic
seizures.
Animal models are used in many studies to investigate epilepsy,
but because of the complexity of the nervous system a great
number of confounding variables are difﬁcult to control for.
Additionally, it has been reported that blocking the connections
between the two hippocampi breaks down the formation of a
‘‘mirror imaging epileptogenic focus’’. This indicates that the
transmission of the ‘‘epileptic wave’’ between neurons is an
important part of the epileptic microenvironment.18 Accordingly,
we followed the procedure described by Sombati18 and found that
after 3 h of exposure to magnesium-free extracellular ﬂuid, 100% of
neurons displayed sustained epileptiform discharge. 24 h after
restoring normal maintenance media, more than 90% of neurons
displayed epileptiform discharges. These data further support the

neuronal epileptic discharge model. Our paradigm reveals that pERK1/2 is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. As a
consequence, the expression of its downstream target gene (C-fos)
was increased, as reported previously.6,12
In summary, these data demonstrate that in cultured neurons
displaying epileptiform activity, ERK1/2 is activated and subsequently induces C-fos expression. In turn, this cascade plays a role
in upregulating the expression of GAP-43 and SYP, indicating the
ERK1/2 signaling pathway participates in the pathogenesis of
mossy ﬁber sprouting. More work is required to determine the role
of ERK1/2 in the mechanism of epilepsy pathogenesis. Furthermore, in vivo studies have been performed but not yet published to
address the role of the same signal transduction pathway in mossy
ﬁber sprouting, which may lend insight into the mechanism of
recurrent spontaneous attacks of epilepsy. These mechanistic
ﬁndings implicate attractive new targets for the development of
drugs that may prevent epilepsy in patients.
