Orphan receptor Nurr1 participates in the acquisition and
maintenance of the dopaminergic cell phenotype, modulation
of inflammation, and cytoprotection, but little is known about
its regulation. In this study, we report that Nurr1 contains a
bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) within its DNA binding domain and two leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NES) in
its ligand binding domain. Together, these signals regulate
Nurr1 shuttling in and out of the nucleus. Immunofluorescence
and immunoblot analysis revealed that Nurr1 is mostly nuclear.
A Nurr1 mutant lacking the NLS failed to enter the nucleus. The
Nurr1 NLS sequence, when fused to green fluorescent protein,
led to nuclear accumulation of this chimeric protein, indicating
that this sequence was sufficient to direct nuclear localization of
Nurr1. Furthermore, two NES were characterized in the ligand
binding domain, whose deletion caused Nurr1 to accumulate
predominantly in the nucleus. The Nurr1 NES was sensitive to
CRM1 and could function as an independent export signal when
fused to green fluorescent protein. Sodium arsenite, an agent
that induces oxidative stress, promoted nuclear export of ectopically expressed Nurr1 in HEK293T cells, and the antioxidant
N-acetylcysteine rescued from this effect. Similarly, in dopaminergic MN9D cells, arsenite induced the export of endogenous Nurr1, resulting in the loss of expression of Nurr1-dependent genes. This study illustrates that Nurr1 shuttling between
the cytosol and nucleus is controlled by specific nuclear import
and export signals and that oxidative stress can unbalance the
distribution of Nurr1 to favor its cytosolic accumulation.

Transcription factor Nurr1 (NOT/NR4A2) together with
Nur77 (NGIF-B/NR4A1) and Nor-1 (MINOR/NR4A3) constitute the orphan receptor subfamily of the steroid nuclear hormone receptors (1). These three receptors trans-activate target
genes through monomer binding to a consensus nerve growth
factor-responsive element (NBRE)4 sequence (AAAGGTCA)
or homodimer binding to the palindromic NurRE sequence
(AAAT(G/A)(C/T)CA) (2, 3). Unlike most other nuclear receptors, crystal structure and NMR data indicate that orphan
receptors can function as ligand-independent transcription
factors because the putative ligand binding domain is occupied
by several bulky hydrophobic side chains (4, 5). Nurr1 can also
heterodimerize with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor to mediate
retinoid signaling (6, 7).
Nurr1 participates in a variety of biological processes such as
development and survival of dopaminergic neurons (8), regulation of macrophage inflammatory genes (9), and progression of
cancer cells by suppressing apoptosis (10 –12). Nurr1 is
expressed predominantly in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and limbic areas of the brain and is responsible for
acquisition and maintenance of neuronal dopaminergic phenotypes. It controls dopamine metabolism by inducing the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, monoamine vesicular transporter
2 (VMAT2), L-aromatic amino acid descarboxylase (AADC),
etc. (13, 14). In humans, mutations in the Nurr1 gene have been
associated with neurological diseases, including Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, and manic depression (14 –17). In animal
models, homozygous Nurr1 knock-out mice are lethal due to
lack of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, which are known
to degenerate in Parkinson disease, and heterozygous mice
exhibit high vulnerability to the parkinsonian toxin 1-methyl4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (8, 14, 18). Nurr1 also

Background: Little is known about the regulation of transcription factor Nurr1.
Results: We identified a bipartite NLS and two NES signals implicated in its subcellular trafficking, and we report that oxidative
stress induces nuclear export of Nurr1.
Conclusion: Nurr1 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, and its subcellular localization is modified by stress.
Significance: Nurr1 subcellular localization will help understand its function under physiopathological conditions.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Culture and Reagents—Human embryonic kidney
(HEK) 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and 80 ␮g/ml gentamycin. MN9D is
an immortalized dopaminergic neuronal cell line derived from
mouse mesencephalon. MN9D cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS and 80 ␮g/ml gentamicin. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were grown in
DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100
␮g/ml streptomycin. Sodium arsenite, leptomycin B, and
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) were from Sigma.
Plasmids—Vector pCI-HA-CRM1 was provided by Dr. Alan
Diehl (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). Vectors
pGL3-NBRE3⫻Luc and pGL3-TkLuc were provided by Dr.

Kazuhiko Umesono (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). pCMXNurr1 was used as a template to generate Nurr1 PCR insert with
oligonucleotides that introduce EcoRV and NotI restriction
sites at both ends (Table 1, pcDNA3.1-Nurr1-V5His). Nurr1
NES and NLS mutants were generated with the Gene Tailor
site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen) using as template pcDNA3.1-Nurr1-V5His. Oligonucleotides to generate
Nurr1 NES1*, Nurr1 NES2*, and Nurr1 NES1/2*, Nurr1 NLS1*,
Nurr1 NLS2*, and Nurr1 NLS1/2* mutants are described in
Table 1. pEGFP-NES1, pEGFP-NES2, pEGFP-NLS1, and
pEGFP-NLS2 were generated introducing sequences of NES1,
NES2, NLS1, and NLS2 on pEGFP-C1 with the oligonucleotides shown in Table 1. Forward and complementary oligonucleotides were annealed at a final oligonucleotide concentration of 100 pM at 80 °C for 2 min. The mixture was then slowly
cooled to 4 °C with a thermal profile of 1 °C/min. 50 pM of double-stranded oligonucleotide was 5⬘-end-phosphorylated using
T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) with 1 mM
ATP. Cloning was performed using restriction enzymes
BamHI/BglII.
Luciferase Assays—HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well
plates (75,000 cells per well), cultured for 16 h, and transfected
with luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-NBRE3⫻Luc and
pGL3-TkLuc using the calcium phosphate method. After 24 h
of transfection, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity with the luciferase assay system (Promega), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Relative light units were measured
in a GLOMAX 96-microplate luminometer (Promega).
Preparation of Nuclear and Cytosolic Extracts—MN9D,
SH-SY5Y, and HEK293T cells were seeded in p100 plates (2 ⫻
106 cells/plate). HEK293T cells were transfected with calcium
phosphate, and after 24 h, cells were treated with 100 ␮M
sodium arsenite for 30, 60, or 90 min. Cytosolic and nuclear
fractions were prepared as described previously (38). Briefly,
cells were washed with cold PBS and harvested by centrifugation at 1100 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in
3 pellet volumes of cold buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.15
mM EDTA, 0.015 mM EGTA, 10 mM KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1
mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium
pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 ␮g/ml leupeptin) and incubated in ice for 30 min. Then the homogenate was
centrifuged at 500 ⫻ g for 5 min. The supernatants were taken
as the cytosolic fraction. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in
5 volumes of cold buffer B (10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM
EDTA, 0.1 mM NaCl, 25% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM
sodium orthovanadate, 1 ␮g/ml leupeptin). After centrifugation in the same conditions indicated above, the nuclei were
resuspended in loading buffer containing 0.5% SDS. The cytosolic and nuclear fractions were resolved in SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.
Immunocytochemistry—HEK293T cells were seeded in 24well plates (75,000 cells per well) on poly-D-Lys-covered slides,
cultured for 16 h, and transfected with calcium phosphate.
After 24 h, cells were treated with 100 ␮M sodium arsenite for
30 or 60 min. Then cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After
three 5-min washes with PBS, cells were permeabilized with

modulates the inflammatory response in midbrain astrocytes
and microglia, suggesting a role in protection against these processes that are intimately linked to neurodegeneration (19).
Other functions associated with Nurr1 include regulation of
osteocalcin in osteoblasts (20, 21), aldosterone synthase in
adrenal cortex (22), and aromatase in ovarian granulosa cells
(23). Moreover, Nurr1 participates in development of some
colorectal, bladder, and lung cancers (24 –26). Therefore, a
characterization of physiological and pathological mechanisms
that regulate Nurr1 transcriptional activity may provide better
evidence on the relevance of this transcription factor as a new
therapeutic target for these diseases.
Nurr1 is regulated primarily by phosphorylation by ERK or
AKT, sumoylation by protein inhibitor of activated STAT-␥, or
dimerization with glucocorticoid or retinoid receptors (6, 16,
27–31). However, little is known about a possible mechanism
involved in regulation of its subcellular localization under both
basal and stimulus-induced conditions. Cytoplasm-nucleus
and nucleus-cytoplasm trafficking through nuclear pores is
mediated by a variety of nuclear importin and exportin proteins (32) that recognize the NLS (33) or NES (34) on cargo
proteins and facilitate their transport in a Ran GTPase-dependent manner. In the case of nuclear export, CRM1 (chromosome region maintenance-1) has been characterized as a
nuclear exportin for many transcription factors (35), including
Nur77 (36), but so far there is no evidence indicating that Nurr1
might be a cargo for this exportin. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and oxidation may
alter the cytoplasmic to nuclear ratios of proteins (3, 19 –24).
Among these modifications, oxidative stress has been associated with significant alterations in nuclear transport (37) and
may be of great relevance in neurodegenerative diseases and
other pathologies.
In this study, we have characterized two NLS and two NES,
which are responsive to CRM1 in Nurr1. We also provide evidence that oxidative stress provokes nuclear export of Nurr1.
These results uncover a new mechanism of regulation of nuclear/cytoplasm shuttling of Nurr1 that explain how oxidative
stress participates in loss of Nurr1 transcriptional activity.

RESULTS
Nurr1 Is a Predominantly Nuclear Protein—In preliminary
experiments, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of Nurr1
in two dopaminergic cells lines, SH-SY5Y and MN9D, of
human and murine origin, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, A

and B, subcellular fractionation assays demonstrated that a
majority of Nurr1 is located in the nucleus, and a minor fraction
is present in the cytosol in both cell types. We generated a
V5-tagged version of mouse Nurr1 to identify and characterize
import and export signals. In HEK293T cells transfected with
an expression vector for Nurr1-V5, subcellular fractionation
assays (Fig. 1C) and immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1D)
indicated that ectopically expressed Nurr1 exhibits a similar
distribution as endogenous protein in dopaminergic cells, with
a tendency to be located at the nucleus. Densitometric quantification of confocal images of Nurr1-transfected cells further
indicated that more than 80% of Nurr1 is localized in the
nucleus under basal homeostatic conditions (Fig. 1E).
Identification of Nuclear Localization Signals in Nurr1—
Analysis of the Nurr1 sequence tentatively suggested one bipartite nuclear localization signal at positions 287–314, located
within the DNA binding domain (Fig. 2A). This putative NLS
(termed here NLS1) conforms to the consensus structure of
typical NLS (ZZX(10 –20)ZZZ, where Z is Lys or Arg and X is any
amino acid), as those found in other nuclear proteins such as
nucleoplasmin, p73, p53, and NRF2 (Fig. 2B) and also in other
orphan receptors (Fig. 2C). Moreover, this sequence is conserved among Nurr1 of different vertebrates (Fig. 2D). In addition, we found a putative atypical NLS (termed here NLS2)
consisting of scattered Arg and Lys residues in a small stretch of
12 amino acids at positions 338 –350, also in the DNA binding
domain (Fig. 2, A and D). This sequence was also conserved in
other orphan receptors (Fig. 2C). To determine whether these
NLSs are functional, we made point mutants of Nurr1-V5,

where some Lys or Arg residues had been mutated to Ala to
generate Nurr1-NLS1*, Nurr1-NLS2*, and Nurr1-NLS1/2* carrying mutations in the putative NLS1, NLS2, or both, respectively (Fig. 3A). HEK293T cells were transfected with these constructs and analyzed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3, B and C)
and cell fractionation (Fig. 3, D and E). Both approaches indicated that wild-type Nurr1 was mostly nuclear, although all
NLS mutants were mostly cytosolic. In additional experiments,
HEK293T cells were co-transfected with expression vectors for
Nurr1 and Nurr1-NLS mutants and a luciferase reporter construct carrying three tandem sequences of the Nurr1-responsive element (NBRE-3⫻Luc). As shown in Fig. 3, F and G, wildtype Nurr1 activated this reporter in a dose-dependent manner.
By contrast, the Nurr1-NLS2* mutant did not activate this
reporter even though it was expressed to a similar level as wildtype Nurr1. These results indicate that both regions NLS1 and

5510 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY

NLS2 are part of a bipartite NLS and that both sequences are
required for nuclear localization of Nurr1.
We made chimeric proteins with EGFP fused at its carboxylterminal end with either NLS1 or NLS2 to generate EGFPNLS1 and EGFP-NLS2 (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4, B and C, in
HEK293T-transfected cells, EGFP was localized at both the
nucleus and cytoplasm with higher levels in the nucleus. EGFPNLS1 exhibited a similar distribution as EGFP alone. However,
EGFP-NLS2 was strictly nuclear and accumulated in nuclear
bodies. These results indicate that although both NLS1 and
NLS2 are required to drive Nurr1 to the nucleus (Fig. 3), the
NLS2 sequence is strong enough to translocate at least EGFP.

sequence at positions 443– 445 (NES1) and 568 –577 (NES2)
(Fig. 5A). Both sequences conform to the consensus motif
LX(1–3)LX(2–3)LXL where L is Leu and X is any amino acid.
These sequences are similar to functional NES found in other
proteins subjected to nuclear/cytoplasm shuttling such as
I␬B-␣, TFIIIA, hDM2, p53, p73, PKI-␣, and Nrf2 (Fig. 5B).
Moreover, both putative NES are conserved in orphan receptors Nur77 and Nor-1 (Fig. 5C) and in Nurr1 from several vertebrates, including human, mouse, rat, Xenopus, and fish (Fig.
5D).
Nuclear export of proteins depends in many cases on exportin CRM1. Therefore, to determine whether the two putative
NES sequences are functional, we generated V5-tagged point
mutants of Nurr1, where critical Leu and Ile residues had been
changed to Ala to generate Nurr1-NES1*, Nurr1-NES2*, and
Nurr1-NES1/2* (Fig. 6A). HEK293T cells were co-transfected
FEBRUARY 22, 2013 • VOLUME 288 • NUMBER 8

with expression vectors for these proteins and for HA-tagged
CRM1. Cell fractionation (Fig. 6, B–F) and immunofluorescence (Fig. 6, G–K) assays indicated that wild type and point
mutants were mostly nuclear. However, in the presence of
CRM1, wild-type Nurr1 was redistributed to the cytosol,
whereas mutants in NES1, NES2, or both remained mostly
nuclear (Fig. 6, F and K). These results indicate that both NES
sequences participate in nuclear export of Nurr1.
To further determine the relevance of each NES, we made chimeras of EGFP fused at the carboxyl terminus with either NES1
(EGFP-NES1) or NES2 (EGFP-NES2) (Fig. 7A). HEK293T cells
were co-transfected with expression vectors for these proteins
and analyzed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 7, B and C). EGFP
was mostly nuclear as expected and insensitive to CRM1-mediated export. By contrast, EGFP-NES1 was already cytoplasmic even in the absence of ectopically expressed HA-CRM1,
suggesting that this NES1 is so strong that it can be exported
with endogenous exportins. EGFP-NES2 yielded a mixed cytoplasmic and nuclear pattern and required overexpression of
HA-CRM1 to be exported efficiently to the cytoplasm. These
results indicate that both NESs are functional but that NES1 is
the strongest.
Oxidative Stress Provokes Nuclear Exclusion of Nurr1—Oxidative stress affects the subcellular localization of various proteins. Therefore, we determined whether the localization of
Nurr1 is susceptible to regulation by sodium arsenite, which
interacts with sulfhydryl groups, depletes glutathione, and is a
well established inducer of oxidative stress (40). HEK293T cells
were transfected with V5-tagged wild-type Nurr1. After transfections, cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 16 h
and then treated with sodium arsenite (100 ␮M). Under these

conditions, sodium arsenite induced a time-dependent translocation of Nurr1 to the cytosol that was abrogated when cells
were preincubated with the oxidant blocker NAC (10 mM, 3 h)
(Fig. 8, A–C). Consistently, arsenite reduced the transcriptional
activity of Nurr1 toward the NBRE-driven luciferase reporter,
and NAC reversed this constraint (Fig. 8D). These results suggest that oxidative stress induces the nuclear exclusion of
Nurr1, either by preventing import or accelerating export,
resulting in loss of its transcriptional activity.
NES2 Participates in the Redox-dependent Export of Nurr1—
To analyze in more detail these two possibilities, we compared
the subcellular distribution of V5-tagged wild-type Nurr1 and
the NES mutants Nurr1-NES1*, Nurr1-NES2*, and Nurr1NES1/2* following 30, 60, and 90 min of incubation with arsenite (Fig. 9). Sodium arsenite induced a time-dependent transloFEBRUARY 22, 2013 • VOLUME 288 • NUMBER 8

cation to the cytosol of wild-type Nurr1-V5 (Fig. 9, A and E) and
Nurr1-NES1* (Fig. 9, B and F). By contrast, Nurr1-NES2* (Fig.
9, C and G) and Nurr1-NES1/2* (Fig. 9, D and H) were unresponsive to sodium arsenite. These results indicate that oxidative stress favors export of Nurr1 through the use of the NES2
sequence.
To gain further insight into this effect, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of the same mutants by immunofluorescence (Fig. 10, A–D and E). Wild-type Nurr1-V5 redistributed
to the cytoplasm after treatment with sodium arsenite (100 ␮M,
60 min). Similarly, Nurr1-NES1*, harboring NES2 but not
NES1, also responded to sodium arsenite, rendering Nurr1
cytosolic. By contrast, Nurr1-NES2* and NES1/2*, both lacking
NES2, were resistant to sodium arsenite-induced translocation.
Hence, these results indicate that NES2, but not NES1, is sensitive to redox regulation.
Nuclear Export of Nurr1 Results in Loss of Dopaminergic
Phenotype—The functional relevance of arsenite-induced
changes in the subcellular localization of Nurr1 was addressed
in the dopaminergic cell line MN9D. As shown in Fig. 11, A and
C, in this cell line endogenous Nurr1 redistributed to the cytosol in response to arsenite with similar kinetics as found for
ectopically expressed Nurr1-V5 in HEK293T cells. Moreover,
this change was prevented by preincubating the cells with the
CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B, further demonstrating that the

redistribution is a consequence of accelerated export (Fig. 11, B
and C). Finally, we analyzed in this dopaminergic cell line the
expression of three Nurr1-regulated genes, namely tyrosine
hydroxylase, vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2),
and AADC. As shown in Fig. 11, D–F, the messenger RNA
levels of these three genes dropped to about 50% after 6 h in the
presence of arsenite. Taken together, these results indicate that
oxidative stress promotes the nuclear export of Nurr1 resulting
in reduction of Nurr1-regulated gene expression and loss of the
dopaminergic phenotype.

DISCUSSION
The regulation of transcription factor Nurr1 is ill-defined.
Like the other orphan nuclear receptors, it appears to function
independently of ligands. So far, Nurr1 has been reported to be
regulated by dimerization and post-translational modifications

5514 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY

(41, 42). In this study, we report for the first time that Nurr1 is
also regulated at the level of subcellular localization. Nurr1 has
a bipartite NLS, which we termed NLS1/NLS2, that is implicated in its nuclear localization. We also report the identification of two NES signals involved in its nuclear export to the
cytosol. It is not clear why Nurr1 contains more than one NLS
and one NES. However, several other proteins enclose multiple
import and export signals (43). In connection with the orphan
receptors, it has been reported that Nur77, a related member of
the orphan receptor family, possesses two NLSs and three NES
signals that are implicated in its redistribution from the nucleus
to the cytoplasm (44). Of note, it has been reported recently that
Nur77 is exported from the nucleus by the exportin CRM1 (36).
The presence of several regulatory signals may confer superior
versatility to integrate alternative mechanisms of subcellular
regulation.
Nurr1 presented a predominantly nuclear localization,
although there was a minor fraction in the cytosol. This led us to
identify two NES signals that respond to the exportin CRM1,
which we termed NES1 and NES2. These two NES appear to be
conserved in other orphan receptors (44). It has been reported
that stimulation with NGF induces export of the Nur77/retinoic acid receptor dimer to the cytosol by using this NES (44).
Nurr1 mediates the expression of a battery of genes involved
in dopaminergic cell differentiation, modulation of inflammation, and cytoprotection (14, 19, 45). Such events are downregulated by oxidative stress. Therefore, we speculated that oxidant conditions might inhibit Nurr1 transcriptional activity. In
this study, we found that arsenite, a typical inducer of oxidative
stress that depletes glutathione levels (40), led to nuclear export
of Nurr1. Indeed, NES2 acted as a redox sensor. In fact, this
effect was abrogated by the oxidant blocker NAC.
Our results demonstrating arsenite-induced nuclear export
of Nurr1 are consistent with a recent report showing cytoplasVOLUME 288 • NUMBER 8 • FEBRUARY 22, 2013

mic localization of Nurr1 in glutamate-treated neurons (46).
Moreover, it has been reported that Nurr1 exhibits a cytoplasmic localization in some bladder tumors (26). Although those
studies did not explore the molecular mechanisms involved in
nucleus-cytoplasm shuttling of Nurr1, they provide further evidence on pathological mechanisms that lead to the nuclear
exclusion of Nurr1.
In agreement with the response of Nurr1 to sodium arsenite
as reported here, Nur77 is translocated from the nucleus to the

cytosol by H2O2 treatment in HEK293 cells, as well as by 6-hydroxydopamine in dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells (47). Similar
results have been found for Nor1, the other orphan receptor
member (46). Most likely, the mechanism of export in response
to oxidative stress is conserved in these proteins and involves
the use of the conserved NES (47). The molecular mechanisms
that convert this NES in a redox sensor for nuclear export are
not clear. One possibility is the participation of nearby cysteines
that, through disulfide bonding, might induce conformational

changes that expose NES2. This has been suggested for the
transcription factor Nrf2 (48). However, we have not found
cysteine residues that could likely participate in such a regulatory mechanism. Alternatively, phosphorylation of critical residues might increase the affinity of NES2 for CRM1. Indeed, it
has been reported that CRM1 together with Ran-GTP participates in the export of several phosphoproteins (49), and evidence indicates that Nurr1 is regulated by phosphorylation
(16). Further work will be required to determine how phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications of Nurr1
govern its subcellular localization.
Nuclear export of Nur77 leads to its mitochondrial translocation (50). However, we have not detected Nurr1 in mitochondria (data not shown), and most likely this function of Nur77 is
related to sensitization of cells to oxidative stress-induced cell
death (47, 50). In the case of Nurr1, we propose that nuclear
export is just a mechanism to shut down the expression of its
target genes.
We speculate that this switch-off system could play an
important role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson disease, where oxidative stress is
very relevant. In fact, two genetic variants of Nurr1 (deletion of
Thr-291 and point mutation T245G) have been described in
patients with Parkinson disease (51). These mutations result in
a marked decrease in Nurr1 mRNA levels and subsequent loss
of the dopaminergic phenotype. In line with this hypothesis,
MN9D cells lost their Nurr1-dependent gene expression in
response to arsenite-induced oxidative stress. Future studies
will be required to determine whether oxidant inhibition of the
nuclear localization of Nurr1 may participate in loss of dopaminergic phenotype in pathologies like Parkinson disease or
contribute to tumor development.
