MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a family of small, regulatory, noncoding RNAs that are found in plants and animals. Here, we describe the miRNA profile of the zebrafish Danio rerio resolved in a developmental and celltype-specific manner. The profiles were obtained from
larger-scale sequencing of small RNA libraries prepared
from developmentally staged zebrafish, and two adult
fibroblast cell lines derived from the caudal fin (ZFL) and
the liver epithelium (SJD). We identified a total of 154
distinct miRNAs expressed from 343 miRNA genes.
Other experimental/computational sources support an
additional 10 miRNAs encoded by 19 genes. The miRNAs
can be classified into 87 distinct families. Cross-species
comparison indicates that 81 families are conserved in
mammals, 17 of which also have at least one member
conserved in an invertebrate. Our analysis reveals that
the zygotes are essentially devoid of miRNAs and that
their expression begins during the blastula period with a
zebrafish-specific family of miRNAs encoded by closely
spaced multicopy genes. Computational predictions of
zebrafish miRNA targets are provided that take into account the depth of evolutionary conservation. Besides
miRNAs, we identified a prominent class of repeat-associated small interfering RNAs (rasiRNAs).

The zebrafish is an important model organism to study
vertebrate development (Grunwald and Eisen 2002), and
its genome sequence is close to completion (http://www.
sanger.ac.uk/Projects/D_rerio). The current zebrafish genome assembly (Zv4 June 2004, ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/
pub/assembly/zebrafish/Zv4release) contains 1.56 × 109
base pairs (Gbp), which corresponds to about half the size
of the available human genome sequence. The number of
predicted genes, which is ∼24,000, is nearly identical for
the zebrafish and human assemblies (http://www.
ensembl.org). Recently, an abundant noncoding RNA
gene family has been discovered in plants and animals,
whose members are known as microRNAs (miRNAs)
(for review, see Ambros 2004; Bartel 2004; He and Hannon 2004). miRNAs regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally and are expressed in a developmental and
cell-type-specific manner. The developmental regulation
of miRNAs has only been studied systematically in the
invertebrates Caenorhabditis elegans (Lau et al. 2001;
Lee and Ambros 2001; Ambros et al. 2003; Lim et al.
2003b) and Drosophila melanogaster (Lagos-Quintana et
al. 2001; Aravin et al. 2003; Lai et al. 2003; Sempere et al.
2003), but very little information is available concerning
vertebrate miRNAs. The miRNA profile during the development from oocyte to tadpole stage was recently
studied in Xenopus laevis using a combination of stagespecific small RNA cloning and Northern analysis (Watanabe et al. 2005). This study only identified 28 distinct
miRNAs, three of which were novel miRNA genes. The
number of currently validated miRNA genes in zebrafish
is of similar size (Lim et al. 2003a), and expression was
not resolved as a function of development. In rat,
miRNA expression changes were noticed during brain
development (Krichevsky et al. 2003). In mouse embryos, the spatial expression patterns of let-7b and let-7c,
miR-1, miR-196a, and miR-10a have been examined during development (Mansfield et al. 2004).
Rather than examining the specific expression of
miRNAs, it is possible to assess the general contribution
of miRNAs during development by knocking out components of the RNA silencing machinery. Dicer RNase
III knockout in mouse causes early embryonic lethality
(Bernstein et al. 2003). Dicer-deficient zebrafish arrest
during larval stage development only at around day 10,
because maternally contributed Dicer maintains
miRNA maturation during the early development of the
homozygous mutant (Wienholds et al. 2003). However, if
the maternal Dicer contribution is eliminated, defects
appear much earlier during gastrulation, brain formation, somitogenesis, and heart development (Giraldez et
al. 2005).
In order to obtain a comprehensive picture of the total
number of miRNAs expressed during development of a
vertebrate model organism, we recorded the miRNA profiles during the development of zebrafish. In contrast to
previous studies, we have cloned and sequenced
miRNAs at a larger scale that permitted the identification of 154 distinct miRNAs, 10 of which have not been

Zebrafish miRNAs

previously identified in either zebrafish or other species.
These 154 miRNAs map to 343 unique miRNA precursors. Phylogenetic conservation analysis of experimentally confirmed miRNAs in mammals and previous
PCR-based specific amplification of zebrafish miRNA
candidates (Lim et al. 2003a) supports the presence of
another 10 low-abundance miRNAs encoded by 19
miRNA genes. The cloning approach also revealed the
presence of repeat-associated small interfering RNAs
(rasiRNAs) in fish as a distinct size class of small RNAs.
To facilitate biochemical analysis of miRNA function in
zebrafish, we provide zebrafish target predictions explicitly including conservation analysis.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of zebrafish miRNAs
In order to identify the zebrafish miRNAs, we cloned and
sequenced small RNA libraries prepared from total RNA
isolated from zebrafish at different developmental stages
and some selected zebrafish cell lines (Pfeffer et al. 2003).
The stages we examined corresponded to the early zygote period (0 h), the blastula period (4 h), the segmentation period (12 h), the pharyngula period (24 h), the
hatching period (48 h), and several months old male and
female adults (Kimmel et al. 1995). In addition, two fibroblast cell lines derived from caudal fin (ZFL) and liver
epithelium (SJD) were examined.
From 7835 small RNA clones sequenced, 4658 (59%)
could be annotated as miRNAs (Supplementary Table 2).
The majority of the remaining small RNAs correspond
to fragments of rRNA, tRNA, mRNA, and repeat-annotated sequences from zebrafish. Eight percent of the
small RNA clones could not be functionally annotated
but mapped to the currently available zebrafish genomic
sequences, and 5.5% of the clones could not be mapped
to the zebrafish genome, but we noticed that some of
these sequences matched bacterial genomic sequences.
We have identified by cloning 154 distinct miRNAs
(Supplementary Table 1). Four other miRNAs have been
previously validated in zebrafish using a miRNA-selective PCR-based amplification method (Lim et al. 2003a),
and another six miRNAs can be identified as homologs
of cloned mammalian miRNAs. Taken together, these
miRNAs can be classified into 87 distinct families
(Supplementary Table 3). Relying on the currently available sequence information for human, mouse, rat,
chicken, pufferfish, frog, fruitfly, and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the families can be subdivided by
the pattern of evolutionary conservation. Eighty-one
families are conserved in mammals, out of which 17 include conservation in at least one invertebrate. Four
families are found only in chicken, fish, and frog; one
family is found only in fish and frog; and one miRNA
appears specific only to zebrafish. The zebrafish miRNA
precursor sequences are distributed over 362 unique genomic locations (Supplementary Table 4). Sixty-eight of
the distinct miRNAs are potentially transcribed from
multicopy miRNA genes, unless some of these copies
are transcriptionally inactive pseudogenes.
miRNAs are frequently organized in gene clusters (Lagos-Quintana et al. 2001; Lau et al. 2001). We considered
pre-miRNAs as clustered if they mapped <20 kb apart
and had the same direction of transcription. The 20-kb

cutoff was selected to incorporate genomic segments encoding the spliced clusters of miR-125–let-7–miR-99/100
(Aravin et al. 2003; Rodriguez et al. 2004). We obtained
53 clusters, which together contain 218 of the 362 precursors (Supplementary Table 5). The two largest clusters contain 58 and 33 of sequence-related pre-miRNAs,
and their genomic regions are 16 and 30 kb in size, respectively. The remaining clusters are much smaller and
contain on average 2.5 pre-miRNAs, with a mean cluster
size of 3163 bp (SD = 4714 bp) (see also Supplementary
Fig. 2). Pairs of clustered miRNAs have higher alignment
scores than random pairs of zebrafish miRNAs, consistent with the hypothesis that gene duplication is responsible, at least in part, for the emergence of these clusters
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
To identify repeat-derived small RNAs that may play a
role in regulating chromatin structure (for review, see
Lippman and Martienssen 2004), we extracted sequences
from the small RNA pool that were annotated as “repeat” or “none” and that mapped perfectly to at least five
genomic loci (Supplementary Table 2). We had a total of
291 such sequences, of which 250 were distinct. We observed that they frequently map to the genome in a clustered manner within kilobases of each other, and that
some of these clusters contain small RNAs mapped to
the plus and minus strand of nearby genomic regions
(Supplementary Table 6), consistent with the hypothesis
that they originated from processing of longer dsRNAs.
Seventy-two percent of these small RNAs have a U
nucleotide at the first position, their mean length is 24.6
nucleotides (nt) (SD = 3.2 nt), and their frequency is highest in the 0-h sample (15% of the sequences, compared
with 1%–5% in other tissues and developmental stages)
(Supplementary Table 7). Although the degree of completion of the zebrafish genome sequence and annotation is
much less than those that were available for the fruit fly,
these data suggest that zebrafish, similar to fruit fly, processes repeat transcripts into a class of rasiRNAs (Aravin
et al. 2003).
miRNAs are essentially absent from the early zygote
stage as indicated by a mere 3% miRNA content of the
small RNA library, and undetectable amounts for the
cloned miRNAs by Northern blotting (Fig. 2, below). A
similar observation was made in a study characterizing
miRNAs during development of Xenopus laevis, and
also showed extremely low levels of miRNA in the fertilized egg (Watanabe et al. 2005). In general, for miRNAs
with relatively high cloning frequency (>20 independent
clones), the relative expression can be correlated with
the signal intensities in the Northern blot, except for the
0-h time points at which very few miRNAs were present
at very low levels. To remedy this problem for miRNA
profile display, we normalized clone numbers, taking
into account the relative fraction of miRNAs identified
within the total pool of cloned small RNAs of a given
RNA sample (see legend to Fig. 1).
The picture changed 4 h post-fertilization (hpf), when
zygotic transcription is initiated, and a zebrafish-specific
miR-430 family composed of five members was expressed. This miRNA family is very unusual in that it
has ∼100 gene copies distributed over two large clusters
of 30 and 17 kb within unassembled genome sequence,
and a very small (500 bp) cluster of three miRNAs positioned on chromosome 13 (Supplementary Fig. 3). The
genomes of Fugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis
also appear to contain multiple copies of sequences that

other fish. This miRNA family is also
related in sequence to the human and
mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell-specific miRNAs (miR-291 to miR-295,
miR-302, miR-371 to miR-373),
which also occur in gene clusters
(Houbaviy et al. 2003; Suh et al.
2004).
The expression of the miR-430 family clusters peaked at the 4-h stage,
dominated the miRNA profile up to
the 24-h-stage miRNA, and then decreased (Figs. 1, 2; Supplementary
Table 1). This family was recently examined in zebrafish zygotic Dicer
mutants, and injection of the processed form of a member of this
miRNA family was able to rescue the
brain morphogenesis phenotype (Giraldez et al. 2005). A miRNA related
in sequence and expression level to
zebrafish miR-430b was also discovered in X. laevis, and it peaked in expression during the blastula period
(Watanabe et al. 2005), which roughly
corresponds to the 4-h zebrafish developmental stage.
Another
strongly
expressed
miRNA emerging early in development, at the 12-h stage, was miR-206,
a member of the universally conserved miR-1 family, which was first
shown to be specifically expressed in
the adult mouse or human heart (Lee
and Ambros 2001; Lagos-Quintana et
al. 2002). miR-206 is ∼15 times more
abundant in zebrafish than miR-1,
and its timing of expression is similar
in X. laevis (Watanabe et al. 2005).
At the 24-h stage, when segmentation and much of brain development
have already taken place, we found
that miR-9 and miR-124, both of
which were shown to be specifically
expressed in mouse brain (LagosQuintana et al. 2002), had accumulated to 5% of the miRNA pool, and
this fraction increased to ∼30% at the
48-h stage. The relative increase in
miR-124 is due to an increase in absolute expression level, as determined
by Northern blotting (Fig. 2).
miR-122, which was shown to be
specifically expressed in mouse liver
(Lagos-Quintana et al. 2002), emerged
at the 48-h stage. At this stage, the

and were enriched in the fibroblast cell lines (Fig. 2). In
X. laevis, expression of let-7 members was also only detectable late in development, in the tailbud and tadpole
stage (Watanabe et al. 2005).
The miRNA profiles of the fibroblast cell lines closely
resemble each other, even though the cell lines were
established independently from different tissue sources,
liver and caudal fin. Their miRNA profile is dominated
by the expression of miR-21, which accounted for ∼40%
of all cloned miRNAs, followed by miR-146a, which accounted for ∼15% of all miRNA clones. The remaining
45% of miRNA clones are subdivided between 40 additional miRNA families, where the miR-15 and the let-7
families each represented ∼5%. The absolute amount of
miR-21 in fibroblast cell lines, however, was comparable
to the amount present in adult fish as determined by
Northern blotting (Fig. 2).
Predicted miRNA target genes and sites
To date, predicted miRNA targets have only been provided for an incomplete set of zebrafish miRNAs (John et
al. 2004). Another early study predicted miRNA targets
conserved between mammals and the pufferfish F. rubripes, but does not present specific zebrafish targets
(Lewis et al. 2003). To provide an overview of the potential control of gene regulation by miRNAs and for con-

venience in planning experiments, we provide several
tables of miRNA targets at different levels of cross-species conservation (Supplementary Tables 8–10). Additional details about the predicted targets, such as sequence context of sites on aligned UTRs, are available at
http://www.microrna.org/zebrafish. In general, target
genes are ranked by the total alignment score (S), which
reflects the sum over all sites for all miRNAs that may
cooperatively target the gene if they are coexpressed
(John et al. 2004). Note that one miRNA typically targets
more than one gene (multiplicity), and one gene can be
targeted by more than one miRNA (cooperativity) (Enright et al. 2003). The targets of the miRNAs that are
highly expressed during early development (<48 h) (miR430, miR-124, miR-206, and miR-9) are particularly interesting candidates for initial experimental validation.
We note that many genes implicated in the Wnt and
TGF␤/Nodal signaling pathways important during development (Schier 2003) are predicted to be regulated by
the strong and early expressed miR-430 family (Supplementay Table 8; see also http://www.microrna.org/
zebrafish).
The total number of predicted targets at a given score
cutoff and chosen level of species conservation provides
a rough estimate of the breadth of gene regulation by
miRNAs within one species and the extent of cross-species conservation of specific miRNA–target relationships. Interestingly, there are strong differences in the
specificities of individual miRNAs. For example, in D.
rerio, the number of predicted target genes per miRNA,
called target multiplicity (Enright et al. 2003), ranges
from 0 to 99, with an average of 28 target genes per
miRNA. The cooperativity of the miRNAs (the number
of target sites per gene) ranges from 1 to 11, with an
average of 2.5 miRNA target sites per gene (numbers
based on targets conserved in fish and frog). In planning
validation experiments, we think it is particularly important to take into account the cooperative or combinatorial control of gene expression by a group of
miRNAs (Enright et al. 2003; Bartel and Chen 2004;
Hobert 2004; John et al. 2004), which has recently also
been called “coordinate” control (Krek et al. 2005).
Current computational target prediction methods applied to vertebrates differ in their emphasis on qualitative aspects. Some miRNA target prediction methods require a perfect match between miRNA positions 2–8 and
its complementary target site (Rajewsky and Socci 2004;
Lewis et al. 2005). Our method places a higher weight on
this region in a dynamic programming method over the
entire 21-residue length. Similarly, cooperativity is reflected in our method by numerical addition of S scores
for all target sites by one or more miRNAs on a given
gene, after removal of overlap. Such differences between
algorithms tend to disappear for very high scoring targets. For example, 47% of the targets in Supplementary
Table 8 have a perfect match with miRNA positions 2–8.
We expect further improvements in target prediction
methods to come from large-scale experimental validation.
Material and methods
RNA isolation
To collect total RNA from zebrafish at different developmental stages,
zebrafish embryos were raised at 28°C under standard conditions in 0.3×
Danieau’s solution (Westerfield 1995). The following stages were examined: zygote period (0 hpf), blastula period (4 hpf), segmentation period

Chen et al.

(12 hpf), pharyngula period (24 hpf), hatching period (48 hpf), and male
and female adult (6 mo old). Total RNA was isolated from ∼1500 embryos
per stage or six male or six female fish. To facilitate sample processing
only 500 embryos or two adult fish were homogenized at a time with 5
mL of extraction solution, which was freshly prepared by mixing 1 volume of solution A (4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate, 25 mM sodium
citrate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosinate, 50 mM ␤-mercaptoethanol) with 1
volume of acidic phenol (equilibrated with water at pH 4) containing
0.5% 5-hydroxychinolin (Chomczynski and Sacchi 1987). Five-hundred
microliters of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and 250 µL of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 4.2) were added, and homogenization continued until a
white and turbid solution was obtained. The solution was transferred to
15-mL glass centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm
(Sorvall SS34 rotor) at 4°C. The upper phase was transferred to a new
tube, extracted with 1/2 volume of acidic phenol:chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol (24:24:1), and centrifuged again for 10 min at 10,000 rpm at 4°C.
The extraction of the aqueous phase was repeated until a clear interphase
was observed. The RNA was precipitated from the aqueous solution by
the addition of 2.5 volumes of ethanol and incubation at −20°C overnight. The RNA was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 rpm
at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was redissolved in
1 mL of solution A. The RNA was precipitated by the addition of 1 mL
of isopropanol and incubation for 15 min at room temperature. The RNA
was then collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 10,000 rpm at 4°C, and
the pellet was washed twice with 5 mL of 70% ethanol at room temperature. The dried pellet was dissolved in formamide to a concentration
of ∼1 mg/mL.
Zebrafish cell lines
Zebrafish ZFL and SJD cell lines were purchased from LGC Promochem,
catalog numbers CRL-2643 and CRL-2296, respectively. Cells were
grown in standard culture medium (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium
supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum) at 28°C and 5% CO2 in a
humidified incubator. Cells (3 × 108) were trypsinized, collected, and
transferred to a small glass homogenizer. The RNA was isolated following the protocol described above starting with 3 mL of solution A.
Small RNA cloning and Northern blotting
Small RNA cloning was performed according to the alternate protocol
(Pfeffer et al. 2003), using chemically adenylated 3⬘ adapter and the truncated T4 RNA ligase 2, Rnl2(1–249) (Ho et al. 2004; Meister et al. 2004).
As size markers for the RNA fractionation, the following 19- and 24-nt
RNAs were used: 5⬘-32pCGUACGCGGGUUUAAACGA-3⬘ and 5⬘-32pC
GUACGCGGAAUAGUUUAAACUGU-3⬘. Two-hundred micrograms of
total RNA was used as starting material for library preparation. The PCR
product was digested with PmeI restriction endonuclease to avoid cloning and sequencing of size markers before the second PCR step. Cloning
and sequencing were performed as described (Pfeffer et al. 2004). On
average, 300 clones containing concatamerized PCR products were sequenced per library. Northern blot analysis was performed as described
(Pfeffer et al. 2004) loading 30 µg of total RNA per lane and using 5⬘
32
P-radiolabeled 21- or 22-nt oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to
the predominantly cloned miRNA sequence. To monitor equal loading of
total RNA, the blots were reprobed with 5⬘-TGGTGTTTCCGCCCG
GTTT-3⬘ to detect tRNAval.
Sequence analysis
We used the most recent version, Zv4 June 2004, of the zebrafish genome
assembly produced by the Zebrafish Sequencing Group at the Sanger
Institute (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/assembly/zebrafish/Zv4release). The
genome assembly and some functional annotation are available from the
genome browser at the University of California at Santa Cruz (http://
genome.cse.ucsc.edu). For our functional annotation, we assembled a
database of rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, and mRNA sequences
by querying GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/Genbank/index.html),
with the appropriate feature key and species (zebrafish, other fish including Barbus barbus, Carassius carassius, Cynoscion nebulosus, Cyprinus
carpio, Gobio gobio, Notropis hudsonius, Pimephales promelas, Rutilus
rutilus, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Salvelinus alpinus, Salmo trutta, mouse,
and human). We additionally used a data set of human tRNA sequences
(http://rna.wustl.edu/GtRDB/Hs/Hs-seqs.html), a data set of human and
mouse sn/snoRNA sequences (http://condor.bcm.tmc.edu/smallRNA/
smallrna.html), the Rfam database of miRNAs (http://www.sanger.

1292

ac.uk/Software/Rfam/mirna), and repeat annotations from University of
California at Santa Cruz. We also queried GenBank for species, Rattus
norvegicus, and for feature, scRNA (small cytoplasmic RNA). Finally, we
incorporated the snoRNA database (http://www-snorna.biotoul.fr) as
well as tables of predicted miRNAs (Lim et al. 2003a; Berezikov et al.
2005; Legendre et al. 2005) into our own database of noncoding RNA.
All small RNAs obtained by cloning were compared with functionally annotated sequences using the Washington University implementation (http://blast.wustl.edu, W. Gish, 1996–2004) of BLAST (Altschul
et al. 1990) as well as in-house sequence alignment programs. For each
small RNA, the best alignments to a functionally annotated sequence
(up to at most three errors) were used to assign a functional category
to the small RNA. In cases where multiple functional annotations
were possible, we used the one reflecting the relative abundance of
RNAs in the cell and the selection imposed by the cloning protocol
(rRNA > tRNA > miRNA > sn/snoRNA > miscRNA > mRNA).
Prediction of miRNA target genes and sites
We used the miRanda method (Enright et al. 2003; John et al. 2004;
software version 2.0 as available at http://www.microrna.org/miranda) to
detect potential target sites for the zebrafish miRNA sequences (Supplementary Table 1) on any of the 23,524 zebrafish 3⬘-UTR sequences retrieved from the ENSEMBL (build 29_4c) database (Birney et al. 2004).
Cut-off conditions for reported target sites: match score S ⱖ 140 and
duplex free energy ⌬G ⱕ −10 kcal/mol. Other parameters and conditions:
scale factor w = 4.0 for complementary nucleotide match score in positions 2–8, counting from the miRNA 5⬘-end; not more than one nonWatson-Crick base pair at positions 2–8 and less than four G:U base pairs
at positions 9–21. These parameters were chosen to reflect current
knowledge as derived from a relatively small number of experimentally
validated miRNA–target relationships and an even smaller number of
validated miRNA–target sites (John et al. 2004).
Evolutionary conservation of candidate miRNA–target relationships
was tested between zebrafish and several organisms (F. rubripes, T. nigroviridis, Xenopus tropicalis, Gallus gallus, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Homo sapiens). Homologous miRNAs were defined as the
most sequence-similar after cross-species alignment. Homologous gene
pairs were retrieved using Ensmart (Kasprzyk et al. 2004). Sequence similarity of target sites, that is, of the mRNA subsequences after optimal
alignment, was computed in terms of a weighted normalized sum (C) of
the number of identical residues, with a weight, w = 4.0 on miRNA positions 2–8 and w = 1.0 elsewhere, reflecting nonuniform functional constraints along a target site. Target sites were considered conserved if
C ⱖ 0.85 between D. rerio and each of F. rubripes, T. nigroviridis, and X.
tropicalis. Similarly, in mammals (human vs. mouse or rat), we required
C ⱖ 0.9. Between fish and mammals, only the miRNA–target relationship was required to be conserved, with no additional cutoff in C.
