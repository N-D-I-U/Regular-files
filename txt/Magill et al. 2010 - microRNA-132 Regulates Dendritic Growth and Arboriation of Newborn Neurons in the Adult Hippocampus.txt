Newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus
rely upon cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) signaling for their differentiation into mature granule cells and their
integration into the dentate network. Among its many targets, the
transcription factor CREB activates expression of a gene locus that
produces two microRNAs, miR-132 and miR-212. In cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons, miR-132 functions downstream
from CREB to mediate activity-dependent dendritic growth and
spine formation in response to a variety of signaling pathways. To
investigate whether miR-132 and/or miR-212 contribute to the maturation of dendrites in newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus, we inserted LoxP sites surrounding the miR-212/132 locus and
speciﬁcally targeted its deletion by stereotactically injecting
a retrovirus expressing Cre recombinase. Deletion of the miR212/132 locus caused a dramatic decrease in dendrite length, arborization, and spine density. The miR-212/132 locus may express
up to four distinct microRNAs, miR-132 and -212 and their reverse
strands miR-132* and -212*. Using ratiometric microRNA sensors,
we determined that miR-132 is the predominantly active product
in hippocampal neurons. We conclude that miR-132 is required for
normal dendrite maturation in newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus and suggest that this microRNA also may participate in
other examples of CREB-mediated signaling.

he dentate gyrus of the hippocampus supports neurogenesis
throughout life, and the newborn neurons generated at this
site form functional synapses, integrate into the dentate network,
and contribute to complex spatial learning (1, 2). Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is stimulated by spatial learning, physical
exercise, and treatment with antidepressant drugs (3–5). Conversely, aging, psychosocial stress, and excess adrenal glucocorticoids are linked to decreases in this type of neurogenesis (6–
8). Interestingly, these decreases may be reversible, and many of
the stimuli that promote neurogenesis also promote dendritic
growth and increased arbor complexity (9). This response suggests that these newborn neurons have a high degree of plasticity
that is strongly inﬂuenced by external stimuli.
One potential mechanism underlying the dendritic plasticity of
newborn hippocampal neurons involves the transcription factor
cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which mediates
signals from a variety of signal-transduction cascades. Several
studies have shown that blocking CREB leads to a dramatic decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and dendritic arborization in
newborn neurons (10, 11), although disparate results also have
been reported (12). Because CREB can activate thousands of
genes, it is difﬁcult to associate speciﬁc targets with particular
CREB functions. In an effort to characterize these targets, we
developed a method termed “Serial Analysis of Chromatin Occupancy” to identify CREB-binding sites on a genome-wide level
(13). Many noncoding RNAs, including one that encoded two
microRNAs, miR-212 and miR-132, were among the CREB tar-

gets. Introduction of miR-132 into primary cortical neurons
stimulated robust neurite outgrowth, whereas inhibition of miR132 blunted neurite outgrowth under basal conditions and blocked
the response to BDNF (14). We demonstrated that these effects
occurred, at least in part, through the actions of miR-132 on the
GTPase-activating protein, p250GAP, which inhibits the activities
of Rac and Cdc42. Subsequent studies using more mature cultures
showed that miR-132 and p250GAP mediated the dendritic
growth and spine formation induced by depolarization and synaptic activity (15, 16). Thus, we proposed that miR-132 was both
necessary and sufﬁcient for activity-stimulated changes in dendritic
growth and spine formation in neuronal cultures. Other microRNAs mediate similar effects in culture (17–19); however, it has
not been determined whether miR-132 or any of these other
microRNAs have these actions in vivo.
Knockout mice have proven to be an excellent tool for analyzing gene function in vivo. However, few brain microRNAs
have been studied using this method, largely for technical reasons. Many brain microRNAs, such as miR-124, are transcribed
from multiple locations in the genome, complicating the generation of effective knockouts. Some brain microRNAs, such as
miR-134, are located in clusters, making it difﬁcult to delete one
microRNA without affecting the expression of others. In other
situations, as exempliﬁed by miR-9 and -9*, biological functions
have been ascribed to both strands of the microRNA, complicating interpretation of which microRNA is responsible for
a particular outcome (20). miR-132, however, is transcribed from
only a single locus and is generated from a precursor that encodes only a limited number of other microRNAs. To determine
which of the four potential microRNAs were generated from the
miR-212/132 locus, we developed a set of bidirectional ratiometric sensors that were capable of distinguishing their activities
at single-cell resolution. Ablation of the miR-212/132 locus
dramatically reduced dendritic length, branching, and spine
density in newborn hippocampal neurons in young adult mice.
Furthermore, we show that miR-132 is the primary functional
product of the miR-212/132 locus in these cells, suggesting that it
is a key mediator of the dendritic phenotype.

ENSMUSG00000065537. Canonical CREB- and RE1-silencing
transcription factor (REST)-binding sites lie between the two
microRNA sequences, and two additional CREB-binding sites
are located ~100 and 150 bases upstream (Fig. 1A). We generated a targeting vector with parallel LoxP sites 0.4 kb upstream
and downstream from the miR-132 gene, creating a LoxP arm
spanning 0.8 kb of the ﬁrst intron. A PGK-Neo-pA cassette
ﬂanked by ﬂippase recognition target (FRT) sites was included
for clonal selection. Following selection with neomycin and
conﬁrmation of the correct integration site by Southern blot,
clonal ES cells were injected into Balb/C blastocysts. Chimeric
mice were crossed into a C57Bl6 mouse, and germline transmission of the ﬂoxed locus was conﬁrmed by PCR. Expression of
mature miR-132 and miR-212 in the cortex of the ﬂoxed mice
was reduced by 46% and 69%, respectively (Fig. 1C), and
a similar reduction occurred in the hippocampus (Fig. S1).
Presumably, this hypomorphic phenotype is caused by the retention of the neomycin cassette. The homozygous ﬂoxed miR212/132 mice were found to be viable, fertile, and grossly normal.
The expression of mature miR-132 was considerably higher than
the expression of miR-212 in these mice as well as in the control
C57Bl6 strain (Fig. 1C). Crossing the ﬂoxed mouse with a ubiquitous Deleter-Cre mouse caused genomic deletion of the miR212/132 locus, as assessed by PCR, and completely eliminated
expression of mature miR-132 and miR-212 (Fig. 1 B and C).

a retrovirus expressing mCherry, which allowed visualization and
quantiﬁcation of dendritic length, branching, and spines. C57Bl6/
J mice also were injected with the mCherry virus alone as a control. To promote hippocampal neurogenesis (4), mice were
housed with a running wheel from 1 d before injection until they
were killed 21 d postinjection. Dendritic length and arborization
were quantiﬁed in newborn neurons from ﬂoxed mice coexpressing GFP-Cre and mCherry (Flox-Cre) and were compared
with neighboring newborn neurons in the same image expressing
mCherry alone (Flox-Ctrl) as well as with newborn neurons in
C57Bl6/J mice that had been injected with the mCherry virus
alone (WT) (Fig. 2). The GFP-Cre virus had no effect on WT
newborn neurons (Fig. S3). The Flox-Cre newborn neurons had
dramatically decreased dendritic arbors compared with neighboring Flox-Ctrl neurons. Furthermore, the Flox-Ctrl neurons
(which express about half the levels of miR-132 and miR-212 as
WT neurons) had decreased length and arbors compared with
WT mice, suggesting that the degree of dendritic growth depends
upon the level of miR-212/132 products. Total dendritic length

was decreased by 33% in the Flox-Ctrl and 76% in the Flox-Cre
newborn neurons relative to WT neurons (Fig. 2G; n = 27 or 28
cells from three or four mice; one-way ANOVA, f2,79 = 83.9, P <
0.001; Tukey’s post hoc test, P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Total
dendritic branching decreased by 31% in the Flox-Ctrl and by
66% in the Flox-Cre newborn neurons relative to WT neurons
(Fig. 2 A–F and H, one-way ANOVA, f2,79 = 68.0, P < 0.001,
Tukey’s post hoc test, P < 0.001 for all comparisons). To ensure
that Flox-Cre newborn neurons, which often had only one dendrite, were not radial glial cells, we immunostained for glial
ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Doublecortin (DCX), and the
neuron-speciﬁc protein NeuN. We found that 96% of Flox-Cre
newborn neurons costained with NeuN, and 90% costained with
DCX, whereas no newborn neurons costained with GFAP, suggesting that the Flox-Cre neurons are indeed immature granule
neurons and not radial glial cells (Fig. S4). Overall, these results
indicate that microRNAs encoded by the miR-212/132 locus
regulate dendritic length and arborization in newborn hippocampal neurons in vivo.
We next examined whether products from the miR-212/132
locus affected dendritic spine formation. The severity of the
dendritic phenotype prevented us from assessing spine density in
many Flox-Cre newborn neurons because they lacked secondary
dendrites and their dendritic arbor barely extended beyond the
granule cell layer (Fig. 2F). Consequently, we quantiﬁed spine
density on second- and third-order dendrites in the inner half of
the molecular layer. Flox-Cre neurons that had secondary dendrites had a 24% decrease in spine density compared with WT
neurons and a 20% decrease compared with Flox-Ctrl newborn
neurons (Fig. S5; n = 30 dendrites from three or four mice; oneway ANOVA, f2,87 = 11.1, P < 0.001; Tukey’s post hoc test, P <
0.01 WT or Flox-Ctrl compared with Flox-Cre).
miR-132 Is the Predominant microRNA Generated from the miR-212/
132 Cluster. Deletion of the miR-212/132 locus ablated four poten-

tial microRNAs, miR-132, -212, -132* and -212*. To determine
which of these microRNAs are functionally important in the newborn hippocampal neurons, we developed a set of bidirectional
ratiometric sensors capable of distinguishing each potential microRNA. These sensors feature a bidirectional promoter to express
simultaneously distinct transcripts encoding a green ﬂuorescent
protein from Aequorea coerulscens (AcGFP) and a red ﬂuorescent
protein, Discosoma sp. Express-1 (DsRedEx1) (Fig. 3A). In the 3′
UTR of the AcGFP transcript, we incorporated three perfectly
complementary microRNA recognition elements (MRE) that
corresponded to the mature microRNA of interest (Fig. 3A).
Thus, the level of AcGFP expression reﬂects the activity of the
microRNA in a particular cell. We minimized the effects of variable expression levels and nonspeciﬁc transcriptional regulation
by normalizing the AcGFP level to the internally expressed
DsRedEx1 that lacked MREs. This approach provided a ratiometric measure that represents the activity of the speciﬁc microRNA with single-cell resolution.
To evaluate its dynamic range, we expressed the sensor for
miR-132 (132-MRE) with increasing amounts of miR-132 mimic
in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and used ﬂow cytometry to
obtain ratiometric green/red (G/R) measurements in 1 × 104 individual red-positive cells per condition (Fig. 3B). A decreased G/
R ratio indicated microRNA activity. Notably, we detected endogenous miR-132 in these cells (Fig. 3B, pink lines compared
with black lines) and observed a dose-dependent decrease in the
G/R measurement of 132-MRE that corresponded to increasing
amounts of expressed miR-132 mimic (Fig. 3B, cyan, orange, and
green lines, respectively). Importantly, the miR-132 mimic had no
effect on a control sensor lacking MREs (designated “No-MRE”;
Fig. 3B, dark blue lines compared with black lines). Sensors for
miR-212 and miR-212* had similar responses, indicating that
both could be used to detect their cognate microRNAs (Fig.

S6A). MREs containing mismatches at positions 9–11 responded
in the same manner but with a narrower dynamic range.
To assess their speciﬁcity, we tested various combinations of
sensors and microRNA mimics. Importantly, expression of scrambled microRNA mimics (miR-Scrm) did not change the ratios, and
the mimics were highly speciﬁc for particular sensors (Fig. S6B).
Notably, 132-MRE could even distinguish between ectopically
expressed miR-132 and miR-212 mimics (Fig. 3C), which have
identical seed sequences and whose mature sequences differ by
only four nucleotides (Fig. S6C). Using Taqman assays, we conﬁrmed that endogenous expression of miR-132 and miR-212 fell
well within the range of the ability of the sensors to distinguish the
ectopically expressed mimics (Fig. S7A).
Magill et al.

To establish the speciﬁcity and sensitivity of the sensors in
primary neurons, we performed Taqman assays for miR-132 and
miR-212 on a population of dissociated hippocampal neurons
that had been freshly dissected or cultured for 4 d. In both cases,
we observed a greater abundance of miR-132 than miR-212 (Fig.
4A). To monitor the activity of each microRNA, we introduced
the sensors 132-MRE, 132*-MRE, 212-MRE, and 212*-MRE
into dissociated hippocampal cultures and used ﬂow cytometry
to assay the G/R ratio either the next day or after culturing for
3–5 d in vitro (DIV 3–5) (Fig. 4 B–E). Approximately 1–5 × 103
individual red-positive live cells were evaluated per condition for
each experiment, and experiments were repeated with seven
different cultures. At DIV 1, we did not observe signiﬁcant differences in the G/R ratio for any of the microRNAs. In contrast,
at DIV 3–5 the sensors reported a signiﬁcant level of miR-132
activity but did not detect signiﬁcant miR-132*, -212, or -212*
activity (Fig. 4 B–E). This result was conﬁrmed using quantitative
confocal microscopy of individual neurons at DIV 1 (Fig. S8)
and DIV 4 (Fig. 4F) in which imaging conditions were calibrated
based on green-only and red-only controls (Fig. S9). Moreover,

We next tested whether the sensors could detect induced
microRNA activity. Using Taqman assays, we had detected miR132 and a much lower level of miR-212 in SH-SY5Y cells under
basal conditions (Fig. S7B). Treatment with retinoic acid produced equivalent fold-increases in both miR-132 and miR-212;
however, the absolute level of miR-132 was considerably higher
(Fig. S7B). We applied our sensors to the same paradigm and,
under basal conditions, saw a decreased G/R ratio between 132MRE and a sensor with a scrambled MRE (Scrm-MRE) and no
signiﬁcant difference between Scrm-MRE and 212-MRE (Fig.
3D). Upon treatment with retinoic acid, the G/R ratio of 132MRE decreased further, and we observed a small but signiﬁcant
decrease of the G/R ratio in 212-MRE (Fig. 3D). This observation suggests that the sensors were capable of detecting endogenous and inducible microRNA activity. To conﬁrm that the
decrease in the observed G/R ratio was the result of miR-132
activity, we used increasing concentrations of a 2′O-methyl miR132 inhibitor and observed a corresponding return of the ratio
back to the No-MRE sensor control (Fig. 3E). Importantly, the
inhibitor had no signiﬁcant effects on the No-MRE sensor control (Fig. 3F).

the predominance of miR-132 activity in these neurons extended
to DIV 17 (Fig. S8).
To determine whether miR-132 was responsible for the observed dendritic growth, arborization, and spine phenotypes in
newborn neurons, we asked which microRNAs were active in
DCX-positive neurons in the dentate gyrus of young adult
C57Bl6/J mice. The expression of the red ﬂuorescent protein
from the (−) strand was insufﬁcient to monitor transduced cells
after lentiviral infection, so we compared the percentage of
DCX-positive neurons that expressed GFP (indicating low
microRNA activity) after infection with equal titers of lentiviral
sensors. With the control Scrm-MRE, 36% of the DCX-positive
cells showed GFP expression (Fig. 5), and a similar percentage
was observed for the 212-MRE, 132*-MRE, and 212*-MRE
sensors. However, only 4% of the DCX-positive cells in mice
injected with the 132-MRE sensor expressed GFP, indicating
that miR-132, but not miR-132*, -212, or -212*, is active in immature granule neurons. Thus, we propose that the lack of miR132 is responsible for the phenotypic changes in the adult
newborn neurons.
Discussion
MicroRNAs are essential for normal brain development and for
establishing the functional connectivity of the brain, as evidenced
by the decreased dendritic complexity, altered spine morphology,

and cognitive defects caused by disruption of the microRNA
processing machinery (23, 24). Linking individual microRNAs to
speciﬁc brain functions has been difﬁcult, especially in the context of intact animals. As a result, most studies have relied on
cell-culture models and have used microRNA mimics, inhibitors,
or sponges (25), all of which have the potential for off-target
effects and can produce partial phenotypes. Furthermore, these
approaches have a mixed record in recapitulating the effects of
genetic knockouts or even can have opposite effects (26, 27).
Generating knockout models has been challenging because brain
microRNAs often are transcribed from multiple genetic loci or
are located within clusters.
Ablation of miR-212/132 is comparatively simple because
a single deletion affects, at most, four potential microRNAs.
Still, understanding such a deletion requires establishing which
of the four microRNAs from the miR-212/132 locus are functional. To address this question, we developed a series of ratiometric ﬂuorescent sensors speciﬁc for each possible microRNA.
Surprisingly, the sensors revealed that only one of the four potential microRNAs miR-132, is functional in hippocampal neurons. Thus, we could use the conditional knockout mouse strain
that we developed to determine the function of miR-132 alone.
To determine the consequences of deleting the miR-212/132
locus in vivo, we examined newborn neurons within the young
adult hippocampus. Hippocampal neurogenesis is exquisitely
sensitive to spatial learning tasks, exposure to an enriched environment, and physical exercise. Studies have shown extensive
changes in dendritic arborization and spine formation in newborn neurons that persist for several months after training for
just 6 d in a Morris water maze (3). This morphological plasticity
is much more evident in newborn neurons than in mature neurons, providing us with a sensitized system for examining the
contribution of miR-132.
To test whether miR-132 regulates dendritic maturation in
vivo, we injected Cre-expressing retroviruses into the dentate
gyrus of ﬂoxed miR-132 mice and examined the morphology of
the newborn neurons. By using retroviral Cre infection, we could
prevent microRNA expression acutely, eliminating the possibility
of compensating effects during brain development that can occur
with a germline knockout. Newborn neurons expressing Cre had
a profound dendritic phenotype characterized by a reduction in
dendritic length, branching, and spine density. Notably, our
sensors conﬁrmed that miR-132 activity predominated in these
speciﬁc neurons. Together with our previous ﬁndings, these
results suggest that miR-132 plays an important role in neuronal
development and maturation in vivo.
Loss of CREB signaling has been shown to impair dendritic
growth and arborization of newborn hippocampal neurons (11).
Our ﬁndings demonstrate that ablating a single CREB target, miR212/132, causes a similar dendritic phenotype in newborn hippocampal neurons, suggesting that microRNAs from this locus mediate some of these CREB effects. This notion is consistent with our
previous experiments using neuronal cultures in which we found
that miR-132 inhibitors largely blocked the effects of CREB on
dendrite maturation. Previously, we had identiﬁed p250GAP as
a target mediating miR-132 effects on dendritic outgrowth in cultured neurons; whether p250GAP is sufﬁcient for these effects in
vivo is under investigation. Other miR-132 targets have been
identiﬁed, including methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2),
p120RasGAP, and p300 (28–30), and it will be interesting to determine whether any of these contribute to the dendritic phenotype.
In addition to its role in dendrite maturation, CREB is necessary for the survival of newborn granule neurons (10). Thus, it will
be important to determine whether newborn neuron survival
depends on miR-132. The effects of miR-132 on dendritic growth
and neuronal survival could be interdependent; a large proportion
of the newborn hippocampal neurons undergo apoptosis (31),
and survival may depend on whether immature neurons become

functional product of the miR-212/132 locus in both hippocampal
cultures and newborn granule neurons. Thus, we have identiﬁed
a mechanism whereby CREB signaling through microRNAs can
promote the growth and maturation of newborn neurons in the
hippocampus. Future studies will elucidate the generality of this
pathway and how it may underlie activity-dependent changes in
other parts of the brain.

functionally integrated into circuits. A severe dendritic phenotype
caused by loss of CREB signaling or miR-132 expression could
prevent integration, rendering these cells more susceptible to
elimination.
Two recent papers implicated striatal miR-212 as an essential
component of the mechanism underlying cocaine addiction (32,
33). Our data indicated that mature miR-132 is expressed at
a signiﬁcantly higher level than mature miR-212 in hippocampus
and cortex. Although low levels of mature miR-212 expression
could be detected, functional activity, as measured using the sensors, is minimal under basal conditions, suggesting a potential
threshold (34). Without the information provided by the microRNA sensors, it would have been difﬁcult to rule out the possibility
that the low level of miR-212 expression results from different
PCR primer efﬁciencies. However, the expression and sensor data
combined indicate that miR-212 levels are considerably lower than
those of miR-132. Whether the levels of miR-212 are sufﬁcient to
mediate a functional response is uncertain. An advantage of the
sensors is that they allow monitoring of speciﬁc microRNA activity
in individual cells, as we demonstrated using the immature neuron
marker, DCX. It will be interesting to determine whether miR-212
is functionally active in dorsal striatal neurons.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that miR-132 mediates the
dendritic outgrowth of newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus
in vivo. Furthermore, we have shown that miR-132 is the primary

Floxed miR-132/212 mice were generated by Ozgene. Stereotactic injections
were performed as previously described (35). The CAG-GFP-Cre retrovirus (21)
was a generous gift from F. Gage (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Full experimental details for mice generation, viruses, cell culture, immunohistochemistry, imaging, and ﬂow cytometry can be found in SI Materials and
Methods. All experiments were approved by the Oregon Health and Science
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
