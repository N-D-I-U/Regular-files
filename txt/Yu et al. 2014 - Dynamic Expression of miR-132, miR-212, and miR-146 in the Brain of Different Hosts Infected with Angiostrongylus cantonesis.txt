Abstract Increasing evidence shows that microRNAs
(miRNAs) are a family of regulatory molecules involved in
many physiological processes, including the inflammation in
central nervous system (CNS) and neurological disorders.
Angiostrongylus cantonensis (A. cantonensis) is the major cause
of human infectious eosinophilic meningitis and can induce CNS
injury. In the present study, we investigated the expression of
miRNAs involved in neuronal functions such as miR-132-3p/
212-3p, and miR-146a-5p, inflammation-related miRNA, in the
modulation of inflammation of CNS of mice and rats induced by
A. cantonensis . The functions of differentially expressed
miRNAs were analyzed through bioinformatics methods, and
the expression of chosen target genes were investigated by
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
The results showed that miR-146a-5p upregulated in the brain
of rats after 21 days; A. cantonensis infection and the expression
of miR-132-3p and miR-146a-5p upregulated in the brain of
mice model infected by A. cantonensis. The expression of the
target genes of mmu-miR-146a-5p such as Irak1 and Traf6

downregulated in 14 days and 21 days after A. cantonensis
infection. Our results supply more information about the involvement of the miRNAs in the regulation of inflammation of CNS
induced by A. cantonensis.

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that play
critical roles in the regulation of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level (Lim et al. 2005). There are abundant
miRNAs in the nervous system, and a highly conserved
pathway of miRNA biogenesis is closely linked to the transport and translatability of mRNAs in neurons (Kosik 2006).
Research shows that miRNA-146a is an important modulator
of the innate immune response and inflammatory signaling in
specific immunological and brain cell types (Lukiw et al.
2011). And the changes in the expression of miR-146a have
been implicated in both the development of multiple cancers
and in the negative regulation of inflammation induced via the
innate immune response (Williams et al. 2008). There is
evidence to approve that miR-132 is an important molecule
regulating embryonic stem cell differentiation into dopamine
neurons by directly targeting Nurr1 gene expression (Yang
et al. 2012). The former report also reveals that the miR-212/
132 cluster contained the miRNAs most responsive to brainderived neurotrophic factor treatment (Remenyi et al. 2010).
These miRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of
inflammation-related disease and may help promote the diagnosis and treatment for these diseases.
The rat lungworm, Angiostrongylus cantonensis (A.
cantonensis), as the causative agent of eosinophilic meningitis
(EM), can induce central nervous system (CNS) injury. Rats are
the principal permissive host, and mice are nonpermissive host
(Alicata 1991; Alto 2001; Lee et al. 2006). Research shows that
larval development is retardant, and the CNS injuries are more

92

serious in nonpermissive host (OuYang et al. 2012). Humans
are incidentally infected either by eating uncooked intermediate
hosts or by consuming vegetables containing the living thirdstage larvae (Tsai et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2011; Lv et al. 2009).
Central nervous system manifestations included headache, fever, stiff neck, hyperesthesia, cranial nerve palsy, diplopia, and
ataxia. Laboratory findings included peripheral eosinophilia
and cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia, elevated immunoglobulin
E levels, and transient increases in white blood cell count and in
serum levels of creatine kinase, transaminase, and lactate dehydrogenase (Alto 2001; Slom et al. 2002; Tsai et al. 2001).
Infected nonpermissive host such as mice suffered more serious
injuries and provoked more intense inflammatory response as
compared to infected permissive host such as rats. The adjustment mechanism of the pathogenesis of angiostrongyliasis
cantonensis is complicated and needs more investigation.
The objective of this present study was to explore the
expression change of some brain enriched miRNAs during
the inflammation of CNS of different hosts and their function
in EM induced by A. cantonensis through analysis of
some of their target genes. Some miRNAs such as miR132-3p, miR-212-3p, and miR-146a-5p were included in
this study.

Histochemistry examination of animal model and tissue
preparation for RNA isolation
The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the rats
were sacrificed under deep anesthesia by ether inhalation at 7,
14 and 21 days after infected by A. cantonensis; 0 day with no
infection group was deal with the first day, and all other
control groups were also included at the same day with infection groups. After decapitation, the cerebrum tissue was removed quickly using RNase-free instruments and frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. And the
specimens of the brain tissue of these infection group and
control were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 2 days. After
embedded in paraffin, they were serially sectioned and stained
with hematoxylin eosin (HE) according to the conventional
staining methods.
RNA isolation
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. They were
stored at −80 °C until further use after total RNA was resuspended in DEPC-treated water. The quantity and integrity of
the total RNA was assessed with a NanoDrop 2000 ultramicrospectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA).

Materials and methods
Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
Experimental animals
Thirty-eight male Balb/c mice and 38 healthy male SD rats
aged 6 weeks were purchased from the Center of Experimental
Animals of Sun Yat-Sen University. All animals were kept in
germ-free circumstance with free access to standard pellet diet
and clean water. Animals were cared for in accordance with the
guidelines developed by the China Council on Animal care,
and all procedures were performed according to the regulations
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of
Guangdong Province, China. Two species were separately
and randomly divided into these groups as follow: 0 day with
no infection (5), 7 days infection (8), and control (3), 14 days
infection (8), and control (3), 21 days infection (8), and control
(3) (all these controls with no infection).
Parasite preparation and animal infection
The third-stage larvae of A. cantonensis were obtained from
naturally infected giant African snails. The shell were crashed,
and the tissues were homogenized and digested in artificial
gastric juice (0.3 % pepsin, 0.7 % HCL, and 10 ml/g tissue) at
37 °C for 2 h. Then the third-stage larvae were collected and
counted under a microscope after washed by the distilled
water. Mice and rats were each orally infected with 30 and
50 A. cantonensis L3 larvae separately.

First-strand cDNA synthesis of the miRNA was prep ar ed u s i n g F i r s t - S t r an d c D N A S yn t h e s i s K i t
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocols.
Then the RT-PCR for detecting miRNAs expression
was performed with SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad)
according to the protocol as follows: (1) 95 °C for 30 s;
(2) 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 70° C for
10 s; and (3) all reactions were run in triplicate (Chen et al.
2005). All these primers of miRNAs were bought from Ruibo
Company, and the U6 gene was used as an endogenous
control. The RT-PCR for chosen mRNA targets was
performed as follows: (1) 95 °C for 2 min; (2) 40 cycles of
95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °Cfor 15 s; (3) melting
curve analysis; (4) 50 °C for 30s; and (5) all reactions were run
in triplicate. The primers of mRNA targets (Traf6 and Paip2)
used in quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR) were chosen from PrimerBank (Wang
et al. 2012). These primers were synthetised by Life
Technologies Company, and the actin beta gene was used as
control.
Statistical analysis
Relative quantification method was used and the relative
expression level was calculated with the equation 2−ΔΔCt.

Then the intersection of predicted target genes in at least five
databases integrated in Mirecords and validated target genes in
TarBase were pick out for further qRT-PCR investigation.

Target genes analysis
The prediction of target genes for differentially expressed
miRNA was performed using online database Mirecords
(http://mirecords.biolead.org/) (Xiao et al. 2009). And the target
genes predicted in at least four databases integrated in
Mirecords were chosen. To describe the properties of target
genes and gene products, gene ontology (GO) was used for
annotation and enrichment analysis (Harris et al. 2004). At the
same time, the target genes with experimental support for differentially expressed miRNA were performed using TarBase 5.0

Results
Construction of animal model of A. cantonensis infection
and pathological changes in the brain tissue
The larval of A. cantonensis were found in the brain of both
mice and rats in 7 days after A. cantonensis infection. These
proved the successful construction of animal model of A.
cantonensis infection. And the pathological change in the

94

brain of infected animal in different infection time was observed through histological examination.
For mice infection model, no obviously abnormal brain tissue
was observed in 7 days. While meningeal thickening and inflammatory reaction could been observed at 14 days and aggravated significantly in 21 days. Histological examination revealed mechanical damages in the brain tissue caused by A.
cantonensis larval invasion. Cavities, hemorrhages, and infiltration of large amount of inflammatory cells were observed in the

brain parenchyma. And worms were seen in the subarachnoid
space (Fig. 1).
In rat infection models, A. cantonensis larval were
found in the brain of 7-day group but brain tissue showed no
significant difference with control. Hemorrhages were found
in the brain parenchyma in 14 days, and more dilated
vessels and infiltration of inflammatory cells were observed in
the brain tissue in 21 days after A. cantonensis infection
(Fig. 1).

During the period of A. cantonensis infection, miR-146a-5p
and miR-132-3p/212-3p showed dynamic fluctuation in both
rats and mice model compared with 0-day group with no
infection (Figs. 2a and 3a). In rat models, the results showed

that miR-146a-5p upregulated in the cerebrum tissue of rat
models after 21 days of A. cantonensis infection compared to
the tissues from the control group of the same time (Fig. 2b).
However, there was no significant difference to be found in the
expressions of miR-132-3p and miR-212-3p (Fig. 2b). In mice
model, the expression of miR-146a-5p showed significant upregulation in the 14 and 21 days infection with A. cantonensis
compared with control group of same age (Fig. 3b). The level

Target genes analysis for differentially expressed miRNAs
The chosen predicted target genes of mmu-miR-146a and
mmu-miR-132 include 203 and 255 mRNA genes separately
(Table S1), while there are no predicted target genes of rnomiR-146 in accordance with the former screening conditions.

Discussion
A. cantonensis is a parasite that causes EM and has been
reported to be present on most Pacific islands (Tsai et al.
2004; Sugaya et al. 1997; Jitpimolmard et al. 2007). The
parasitic worms are neurotropic in man, and the infection
presents with severe unrelenting headache, paresthesias, or a
cranial nerve palsy (Alto 2001; Lo Re and Gluckman 2001).
The larvae in nonpermissive host such as mice and human
cannot undergo normal development and fail to complete the
pulmonary migration which induces more intense inflammatory response as compared to infected rats (Yoshimura et al.
1994). miRNAs are single-stranded noncoding regions of
approximately 21 nucleotides that regulate protein synthesis
by targeting mRNAs for translational repression or degradation at the posttranscriptional level. In recent years, a large

amount of research interest in studies on miRNA-mediated
modulation of gene functions during neuroinflammation
(Thounaojam et al. 2013).
The miR-146a expression was confirmed to be present in
reactive astrocytes. In human temporal lobe epilepsy with
hippocampal sclerosis, increased astroglial expression of
miR-146a was observed mainly in regions where neuronal
cell loss and reactive gliosis occurred (Aronica et al. 2010).
Experimental data showed that a large amount of nodular
lesions with infiltration of numerous inflammatory cells were
found in the brain parenchyma of mice or rat models infected
with A. cantonensis. The immunohistochemical staining revealed a severe loss of neurons in the core of these focal
lesions, and only a few injured neurons survived in the peripheral regions of the focal lesion (OuYang et al. 2012). In
this study, the expression level of miR-146a-5p upregulated
significantly and separately in rat models of 21 days infection
and mice model of 14 and 21 days infection with A.
cantonensis compared with control group of same age.
These suggested the higher frequency of lesions and inflammation situation. Report showed that targeted deletion of this
gene results in several immune defects. In response to inflammatory cues, miR-146a was induced as a negative-feedback
regulator of the astrocyte-mediated inflammatory response
(Zhang et al. 2010). miR-146a may play an important role in
neurological disorders associated with chronic inflammation
(Iyer et al. 2012).

miR-132 and miR-212 are tandem miRNAs whose expression is necessary for the proper development, maturation, and
function of neurons and whose deregulation is associated with
several neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease
and tauopathies (Wanet et al. 2012). Former research demonstrated that miR-132and miR-212 have been associated with
brain-related disorders (Wong et al. 2013). In the present
study, the expression of miR-132-3p in mice model showed
significant upregulation in the 21 days of infection with A.
cantonensis compared with the same age control group.
Research showed that retroviral knockdown of miR-132 using
a specific “sponge” containing multiple target sequences impaired the integration of newborn neurons into the excitatory
synaptic circuitry of the adult brain (Luikart et al. 2011). miR132 may function as a regulator of inflammation institution of
the brain (Shaked et al. 2009).
The GO enrichment analysis revealed that the predicted
target genes were most involved in many biological processes
such as cellular process, metabolic process, and biological
regulation. The targeted genes analysis showed that Irak1
and Traf6 downregulated in 14 and 21 days after A.
cantonensis infection. Recent research proved that miRNA146a and miRNA-146b-5p directly bound to the IRAK1 3′UTR and regulated immune and inflammatory responses (Xie
et al. 2013). Experiment study showed that TRAF6 was an
essential adaptor protein for the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and played an important role in inflammation and immune response (Peng et al. 2013). The result of the present
study indicated that miRNA-146 might play a regulated functional role in inflammation through IRAK1 and Traf6.
In conclusion, our study showed that brain-specific
miRNAs, such as miR-132-3p and miR-146a-5p, a regulator
of the innate immune response, upregulated in the cerebrum
tissue of mice infected with A. cantonensis. And the target
genes of mmu-miR-146a-5p such as Irak1 and Traf6 downregulated. The expression of miR-146a-5p also upregulated in
the rat model. The present study suggested the involvement of
the miRNAs in the regulation of inflammation of CNS induced by A. cantonensis.
