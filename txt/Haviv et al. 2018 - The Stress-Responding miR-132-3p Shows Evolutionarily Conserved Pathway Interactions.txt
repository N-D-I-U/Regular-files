Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding
RNA chains that can each interact with the 30 -untranslated
region of multiple target transcripts in various organisms,
humans included. MiRNAs tune entire biological pathways, spanning stress reactions, by regulating the stability
and/or translation of their targets. MiRNA genes are often
subject to co-evolutionary changes together with their target transcripts, which may be reflected by differences
between paralog mouse and primate miRNA/mRNA pairs.
However, whether such evolution occurred in stress-related
miRNAs remained largely unknown. Here, we report that
the stress-induced evolutionarily conserved miR-132-3p,
its target transcripts and its regulated pathways provide an
intriguing example to exceptionally robust conservation.
Mice and human miR-132-3p share six experimentally
validated targets and 18 predicted targets with a common
miRNA response element. Enrichment analysis and mining
in-house and web-available experimental data identified
co-regulation by miR-132 in mice and humans of stressrelated, inflammatory, metabolic, and neuronal growth
pathways. Our findings demonstrate pan-mammalian
preservation of miR-1320 s neuronal roles, and call for

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, approximately 20–25
nucleotides long single-stranded RNA molecules that bind
to complementary sequences in the 30 -untranslated regions
(30 -UTR) of target mRNAs (Lai 2002), referred to as
miRNA response elements (MREs). Binding of miRNAs to
their targets blocks subsequent protein production by either
inhibiting the translation machinery and/or inducing target
degradation (Denzler et al. 2014; Meunier et al. 2013),
depending on the degree of complementarity (Ambros et al.
2003). Genes encoding miRNAs produce a primary transcript (pri-miRNA), which is co-transcriptionally cleaved
by a complex containing the double-stranded RNA-binding
protein Pasha and its RNAse counter-part Drosha (Lee
et al. 2003; Morlando et al. 2008). The resulting stem-loop
pre-miRNA is exported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 (Yi
et al. 2003), where it is further processed by the endonuclease Dicer into a 20–25 nucleotide double-stranded RNA
molecule (Hutvágner et al. 2001; MacRae et al. 2006),
altogether leading to massive regulation of the great
majority of mammalian genes (Bartel 2009). Individual
genes often carry MREs for multiple distinct miRNAs, and
conversely, individual miRNAs often target multiple distinct transcripts (Friedman et al. 2009). Genes encoding
miRNAs can be transcribed and processed from individual
transcription units, from an intron or an exon of a host
gene, from an intergenic area, or even from an exon–intron

junction of coding or non-coding genes (Nepal et al. 2015;
Wanet et al. 2012). Such genes are found in a variety of
evolutionarily distant organisms, including vertebrates and
plants, and they often show evolutionary differences both
in their sequence and targets.
Evolutionary changes in miRNA/target interactions may
take different shapes. In both mice and humans, fully conserved miRNAs, such as miR-132, might regulate different
targets, or present differential preference for suppressing
shared targets, for several reasons: first, alternative transcript
variants of a given gene may contain different 30 -untranslated regions (30 -UTR domains), which could either include
or exclude MREs (Zhu et al. 2007) or be differently
susceptible to miRNA regulation (Mishra et al. 2017).
Transcripts undergoing elongation by alternative polyadenylation (Di Giammartino et al. 2011) may likewise present
differential target interactions. Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the MRE or close to it could
interrupt miRNA binding and/or weaken or strengthen
miRNA/target interaction (Hanin et al. 2014; Simchovitz
et al. 2017). Also, SNPs located within an adjacent binding
site of an RNA-binding protein (RBP) can prevent it from
binding; and by doing so, cause a structural modification that
blocks a proximal MRE (Kedde et al. 2010).
Both evolution of novel miRNAs and alterations in their
target interactions may consist of single nucleotide changes, yet may lead to considerable phenotype differences if
not accompanied by parallel adjustment in the target genes.
Consistently, primate specification was accompanied by
massive coordinated changes in miRNAs and their target
genes, leading to primate-specific miRNA populations and
indicating potential differences in both their capacity and
mechanism of action for controlling specific biological
pathways between humans and mice (Barbash et al. 2014);
specifically, acute psychological stress responses may be
subject to evolutionarily diverse miRNA regulators,
reflecting changes in the capacity of species to react to
stressful impacts (Hanin et al. 2014; Leung and Sharp
2010; Pandey et al. 2016).
We selected for our current study to focus on miR-132,
the stress regulatory capacities of which have been studied
for over a decade, especially in the brain, and its many
roles were extensively explored using transgenic in vivo
models, among other research systems (Edbauer et al.
2010; Jimenez-Mateos et al. 2011; Luikart et al. 2011;
Mellios et al. 2011; Nudelman et al. 2010). Those studies
showed involvement of miR-132 in neuronal functions,
including process extension and neuronal activity. Specifically, transgenic overexpression of miR-132 increases
dendritic spine density while causing significant deficits in
novel object recognition (Hansen et al. 2010) via suppression of a specific miR-132 target, the p250 GTPaseactivating protein (P250GAP) (Wayman et al. 2008); also,

123

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2018) 38:141–153

miR-132 controls dendritic plasticity by modulating the
expression of the stress-sensitive transcription factor
methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) (Fyffe et al. 2008;
Klein et al. 2007) known for its role in the Rett syndrome
(Amir et al. 1999). Further, miR-132 is required for the
dendritic growth and arborization of newborn neurons in
the adult mouse hippocampus (Magill et al. 2010) and
regulates structural plasticity of dendritic spines in the
mouse through its target matrix metalloproteinase 9
(Mmp9) (Jasińska et al. 2015). Notably, the expression of
miR-132 is impaired in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains
(Lau et al. 2013; Soreq 2015), while Mmp9 levels were
shown to be elevated in the plasma of AD patients as
compared to controls (Lorenzl et al. 2003).
MiR-132 is also a major regulator of cholinergic signaling (Meerson et al. 2010; Ponomarev et al. 2011;
Shaltiel et al. 2013), which is both modulated under
stressful insults and subject to complex miRNA regulation
(Soreq 2015). The miR-132 predicted binding sites in its
target transcripts show consistently lower conservational
levels compared to miR-132-3p itself, corresponding to the
global phenomenon in which mammalian, and especially
primate brain-expressed miRNA genes are evolutionarily
more conserved than their predicted binding sites (Barbash
et al. 2014). Thus, miR-132 serves as a most appropriate
test case for exploring rodent-primate links of the stressrelated mode of miRNA functioning.
Regulation of similar targets and/or biological pathways
in diverse organisms could potentially indicate control over
shared processes by the specific miRNA. Alternatively, or
in addition, the miRNA might target other transcripts that
belong to the same pathway, and/or compete with other
miRNAs on interaction with its targets. To compare the
impact of miR-132 regulation in mice and humans, and to
explore its implications in stressful situations, we examined
both the conservation levels of miR-132-3p targets, and the
potential of their interaction with other proteins and the
pathways involved in mice and humans.

Methods
Identifying the Genomic Location and Structure
of miR-132 and Its Predicted Targets
We extracted the mature and pre-miRNA sequences of
miR-132 in different organisms from miRBase (Kozomara
and Griffiths-Jones 2014), and used the Vertebrate Multiz
Alignment & Conservation (100 Species) track in the
UCSC genome browser (Kent et al. 2002) and the T-Coffee
multiple alignment tool (Notredame et al. 2000) to test for
miR-132 conservation. We further assessed its stem-loop
structure based on minimum free energy prediction using

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2018) 38:141–153

the Vienna RNAFOLD webserver (Gruber et al. 2008). To
find its predicted targets, we uploaded the human miR-1323p to Diana microT-CDS (Paraskevopoulou et al. 2013;
Reczko et al. 2012), with a default threshold of 0.7; and
identified those targets that were co-predicted with both
Diana microT-CDS and TargetScan (Agarwal et al. 2015).
Assessing Conserved MREs and Protein–Protein
Interactions
We selected experimentally validated MREs using ‘strong
evidence’ target validation methods in miRTarBase (Chou
et al. 2015). Where we failed to find available validation of
an MRE for a certain gene, we employed a predicted
general MRE based on the findings in other targets. To test
for conservation of MREs between mouse and human, we
pursued validated or predicted murine MREs in the human
and mouse 30 -untranslated region (30 -UTR) sequences,
using the UCSC genome browser (Kent et al. 2002), and
limited our selection to predicted targets with fully conserved MREs. Validated and putative miR-132-3p targets
in human were then submitted to String (Szklarczyk et al.
2014) with the following parameters: organism—Homo
sapiens; prediction methods—Neighborhood, Gene Fusion,
Co-occurrence, Co-expression, Experiments, Databases
(text mining was excluded); required confidence (score)—
highest (0.900). The top 20 interactors that answer those
requirements were chosen for further analysis. Network
presentation of miR-132, its targets, and their interactors
was modified from Cytoscape tool (Shannon et al. 2003).
miR-132 Overexpression
HEK 293T (ATCCÒ CRL-3216TM) cells were grown in a
humidified atmosphere at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM media
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1000
units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and
0.25 lg/ml amphotericin B (Beit-Haemek, Israel). Transfection of 2.5 lg HmiR0268-MR03 plasmid (GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD) was performed using Polyethylenimine (PEI, SIGMA, St. Louis, MO).
RNA extraction was carried out 24 h post transfection
using miRNeasy (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. DNase treatment was applied,
and RNA concentration and integrity confirmed by Nanodrop and gel electrophoresis, respectively.
RNA samples were used for synthesis of cDNA, using
Quanta cDNA synthesis kit for mRNA and qScript
microRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit for miRNAs as per the
manufacturer’s (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersberg, MD,
USA) protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
was performed on CFX-96 (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) and
QuantStudio 12 K Flex-384 (Applied Biosystems, CA,

143

USA) machines using SYBR green master mix (Quanta
Biosciences). The mRNA primer sequences are detailed
in online Resource 3. Serial dilution of samples was used
to evaluate primers efficiency. Long transcript results were
normalized to the expression level of RPL19. For miRs,
PerfeCTa microRNA assay primers (Quanta Biosciences)
were used and results were normalized to the expression of
snoRD47. Fold change values for both miRs and mRNAs
were calculated using the DDCt method.
Pathway Analysis
Pathway analysis of enrichment was performed using
the David Functional Annotation tool (Huang et al.
2009a, 2009b) with the following parameters: Select
identifier: OFFICIAL_GENE_SYMBOL, List Type: Gene
List, Background: Homo Sapiens. Both validated and
putative miR-132-3p targets in human and mouse, and the
proteins they interact with were pursued. The results were
retrieved from the KEGG PATHWAY database (Kanehisa
and Goto 2000; Kanehisa et al. 2016).

Results
Murine and Human miR-132 Genes Share Key
Properties
MiR-132 is a highly conserved miRNA that originates from
intergenic regions on human chromosome 17 and mouse
chromosome 11. Two transcription factors control the miR132 locus: the cAMP-response element binding protein
(CREB), indicating up-regulation under elevated Ca??; and
the Repressor Element 1 silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF), known to be
modulated under aging (Lu et al. 2014) and in AD (González-Castañeda et al. 2013; Lu et al. 2014; Orta-Salazar et al.
2014). Interestingly, one REST and several CREB binding
site controllers of miR-132 transcription appear in all
mammals, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved involvement of CREB and REST as controllers of miR-132
expression (Remenyi et al. 2010; Wanet et al. 2012; Wei
et al. 2013). Furthermore, the genomic site harboring miR132 displays high conservation levels across vertebrates,
mammals, and primates (Wanet et al. 2012). Figure 1a-d
presents these shared features for the genomic origin and
structure of miR-132 in mice and humans.

western blot, were considered as validated targets. This
analysis yielded 19 mRNA transcripts as validated targets

and their locations in the 30 UTR of MECP2 are marked

predicted by the tools mentioned above (Fig. 2b). Predicting that other targets have not yet been validated, we
further searched for transcripts which are validated in
murine but not in human; yet share MREs for miR-132-3p
in their 30 -compete with each other. We found 6 such
transcripts (out of 17), with fully conserved validated
MREs in at least one transcript variant of each gene, 3
more carrying a predicted MRE; one of those, Kdm5a,
includes a partially conserved MRE (6/7 nucleotides)
(Fig. 2a). Those non-validated transcripts were further
included in the analysis, as they have a high potential for
being viable targets of miR-132-3p, and were hence
referred to as ‘‘putative targets.’’
To further support the expected effect of miR-132-3p on
its validated and putative targets, we overexpressed miR132 in the HEK 293T human cell line and examined
selected transcripts for their expression level. We found
that the validated target RASA1 and the putative target
Paip2 were significantly downregulated upon increase in
miR-132-3p levels (n = 3, fold change = 0.62, 0.74, 724
respectively; Student’s t test: p \ 0.05). Other validated
(SIRT1) and putative (Pten) targets showed non-significant
reduction of 20% in their expression levels (n = 3).
Predictably, some of the targets do not contain an MRE for
miR-132-3p in one or more of their 30 -transcript variants,
indicating alternative splicing-dependent regulation. For
example, the MECP2 gene contains multiple polyadenylation sites, which result in transcripts with short (approximately 1.8 kb) or long (ca. 10 kb) 30 -UTRs (Klein et al.
2007). We found that the MRE for miR-132-3p is present
only in the long variant, which is expressed predominantly in
the brain. This finding is supported by experimental evidence, where introduction of miR-132 into primary cortical
neurons decreased MECP2 protein levels, while its introduction into L6 muscle cells, which express the shorter
MECP2 transcript, did not reduce MECP2 levels (Klein et al.
2007), presenting heterogeneous susceptibility of MECP2 to
miR-132 regulation as a result of alternative polyadenylation, similarly to the case of AChE (Mishra et al. 2017).
Intriguingly, the MECP2 transcript was further found to be
subject to regulation by the human-specific miR-483-5p. In
this case (Han et al. 2013), miR-483-5p regulates specifically
the long but not the short 30 -UTR variant of MECP2, and a
miR-483-5p MRE is found only in the human variant. To
examine a possible interaction between miR-132-3p and

123

miR-483-5p regulation on MECP2, we checked the MREs of
both miR-132-3p and miR-483-5p in the MECP2 30 -UTR,
and found that they are distant enough to ensure that they are
unlikely to compete with each other (the 30 -UTR sequence
and MREs are presented in Fig. 3).
MiR-132 Presents a Complex Regulation Network
To predict miR-132-3p-regulated pathways, we extended
our dataset to include proteins which could potentially be
affected by miR-132-3p in an indirect manner. For this
purpose, we submitted all of the validated and putative
targets in human to String (Szklarczyk et al. 2014) and
mapped all of the known interactions between them and
other proteins (Fig. 4). This analysis revealed a complex
pattern of reciprocal interactions between the targets
themselves; for example, the EP300 and RB1, validated
targets of miR-132, and its FoxO3 putative target emerged
as interacting with SIRT1, another validated target (Fig. 4).
Further, SIRT1 was found to activate RB1 and bind EP300,
which in turn can also activate RB1. A yet more complex
interaction was reported between SIRT1 and FoxO3; in the
human cell line HEK 293T under oxidative stress, SIRT1
forms a complex with FoxO3 and deacetylates it, potentiating FoxO30 s effect on cell cycle arrest and DNA repair
target genes but attenuating FoxO3- dependent apoptosis in
the presence of stress stimuli (Brunet et al. 2004). Moreover, mammalian cells which undergo acute nutritional
stress present a FoxO3-dependent increase in SIRT1 levels,
mediated by an interaction with TP53. Notably, FoxO3TP53 interaction exacerbates after nutrient withdrawal
(Nemoto et al. 2004). Moreover, some proteins, such as
Tumor Protein P53 (TP53) and Ubiquitin C (UBC), interact
with more than one target of miR-132-3p (Fig. 4). TP53
can induce growth arrest or apoptosis after cellular stresses
(Nagashima et al. 2001); it binds SIRT1, EP300, PTEN,
FoxO3, and CDKN1A, and is activated by SIRT1 and
EP300. UBC, a stress-inducible gene (Figueiredo-Pereira
et al. 1997; Tsirigotis et al. 2001), binds the miR-132-3p
targets SIRT1, FoxO3, PTEN, PAIP2, RB1, and CDKN1A.
Taken together, these findings could indicate miR-132
involvement in several fundamental processes in the cell by
affecting key proteins, such as TP53 and UBC. These
interactions further suggest that miR-132-3p targets may be
regulated both in a direct and indirect fashion, and that this

regulation could be stress-affected. Therefore, the question
arose if these complex interactions as well are evolutionarily conserved.
MiR-132-3p is Predicted to Affect Shared Pathways
in Mice and Humans
We examined the pathways affected by miR-132-3p both
in human and mouse through its targets and the proteins
they interact with. Pathway analysis of 247 transcripts in
human and 248 transcripts in mouse (including only validated and putative targets, and their interactors) was performed using the DAVID functional annotation tool
(Huang et al. 2009a; Huang et al. 2009b). We started by

examining the pathways analysis in human; predictably, a
large number of the identified transcripts emerged as being
involved in several cancer types, such as Prostate
cancer, Pancreatic cancer, Glioma, and Melanoma (Online
Resource 1, FDR = 6.4E-35, 7.4E-24, 2.2E-22, 8.8E20, respectively). In addition, intriguing non-cancerous
pathways were found to be enriched with genes of interest
(Table 3), and some of those pathways showed experimentally validated relation to miR-132 in mouse. A
prominent example is the immune system, demonstrated by
the predicted involvement of miR-132-3p in T cell and B
cell receptor signaling pathways, chemokine signaling
pathway, Leukocyte transendothelial migration, and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity (FDR = 4.8E-14,

Pathways with more than 4% involved genes are listed. For each selected pathway, the numbers (out of 247
genes), percentage of involved genes, and FDR are shown

5.4E-09, 5.2E-12, 5.6E-06, 3.7E-04, respectively),
which is compatible with the potentiation by miR-132 of
the cholinergic blockade of inflammation (Mishra et al.
2017; Shaked et al. 2009).
Yet more specifically, our analysis re-confirmed miR1320 s involvement in cholinergic synapses (FDR = 9.6E05). The role of miR-132 in the cholinergic system was
demonstrated in numerous studies (Meerson et al. 2010;
Ponomarev et al. 2011; Shaked et al. 2009; Shaltiel et al.
2013), compatible with its regulatory effect on synaptic
transmission (Remenyi et al. 2013). The link between the
cholinergic signaling and stress is well profound (Gilad
et al. 1985; Kaufer et al. 1998); ACh levels are transiently elevated in the mammalian brain during stress
responses (Masuda et al. 2004). AChE, a shared validated
target of miR-132-3p in human and mouse, is responsible, together with the homologous enzyme butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), for terminating cholinergic
signaling by rapid hydrolysis of ACh in the synaptic cleft
(Soreq 2015). In a mouse model of psychological stress,
miR-132 was elevated in the hippocampus, accompanied
by and associated with reduced AChE activity, which
predictably potentiates ACh signaling, and exacerbates
anxiety (Meshorer and Soreq 2006; Shaltiel et al. 2013;
Soreq 2015). Inversely, mice treated with anti-miR-132
oligonucleotide showed elevated activity of the synaptic
variant AChE-S, which may suppress the stress-characteristic hyper-activation of synaptic neurotransmission
(Mishra et al. 2017).

123

Other stress-relevant processes include the Neurotrophin
signaling pathway; the neurotrophin growth factors are
important in neuronal development and survival as well as
in synapse formation and plasticity. One subtype of neurotrophin, BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor),
increases miR-132 expression upon its administration to
cultured primary cortical mouse neurons (Remenyi et al.
2010). We found that 32 of our tested genes were enriched
in the neurotrophin signaling pathway (FDR = 7.7E-19),
indicating a potential involvement of miR-132 in both
murine and human neurotrophin signaling. Likewise, 16 of
the tested genes in the GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing
Hormone) signaling pathway were found to be related to
miR-132-3p regulation (Online Resource 1, FDR =
3.9E-05). GnRH is known to induce the expression of
miR-132 in mouse pituitary gonadotroph cells. Subsequently, it reduces the expression of P250GAP (a validated
target in mouse), resulting in changes in cellular morphology and increased migration (Godoy et al. 2011).
Thus, both direct and secondary processes may jointly lead
to miR-132-3p network interactions.
Lastly, miRNAs were suggested to mediate the connection between anxiety and metabolic disorders (Meydan
et al. 2016). Compatible with the overlapping elevation of
miR-132 in anxiety and metabolic impairments, our
enrichment analysis revealed several metabolic disorders,
such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD,
FDR = 2.8E-04), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD,
FDR = 1.4E-02), and Type II diabetes mellitus

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2018) 38:141–153

(FDR = 8.5E-05), alongside with metabolic-related
pathways, such as the Insulin signaling pathway
(FDR = 5.3E-09). Validating the functional relevance of
this interaction, we have recently shown that mouse models
of hepatic steatosis or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) display dramatic increases in liver miR-132 levels
and corresponding reduction in selected miR-132 targets,
whereas antisense oligonucleotide-mediated miR-132
silencing increases the levels of its targets and consequently reduces the steatotic phenotype (Hanin et al. 2017).
Further, human patients with inflammatory bowel disease
exhibit increased levels of miR-132-3p in intestinal tissue
biopsies, with corresponding decreases in circulatory
AChE activity, relative to healthy controls (Maharshak
et al. 2013), suggesting miR-132 involvement in IBD
alongside with its stress-related target AChE. Interestingly,
comparing the enriched pathways in human and mouse
(Table 4, Online Resource 2) demonstrated that although
only half of the identified genes of interest in mouse and
half of those in human are shared, the pathways predicted
to be affected by them are highly similar; out of 85 pathways in human and 88 in mouse, 74 pathways are shared.
Notably, among the pathways that were found to be unique
to human is IBD. The metabolic and stress links of miR132-3p thus point at multiple ailments as stress-associated.

Discussion
We investigated the regulation characteristics of miR-1323p in human and mouse by comparing murine and human
validated and putative targets and exploring the pathways
they are involved in. We found that human and murine
share 6 validated targets, and that 9 additional transcripts
contain a conserved MRE for miR-132-3p. Notably, the
strict prediction algorithms used in this study predicted
about 63% of the already validated targets in human, while
the percent of shared predicted pathways was 87%. This
could either reflect improved prediction power or a more
profound conservation of the shared pathways in which
this stress-controlling miRNA is involved.
Studying the regulatory impact and evolutionary conservation of miRNAs over stress responses presents challenging issues. While current humans carry an essentially
similar genome to that of our ancient ancestors, the
stressful experiences we are exposed to are largely different, and these differences are evidently larger in humanmouse comparisons. Therefore, we pursued an evolutionarily conserved miRNA that is known to be involved in
stress reactions and where ample research had been done to
identify its regulated targets and controlled pathways. In
this context, miR-132 is especially suitable, as its interaction with AChE had been shown to control anxiety.

149

Specifically, exposing mice to predator scent induces longlasting hippocampal elevation of miR-132, accompanied
by reduced AChE activity (Shaltiel et al. 2013; Zimmerman et al. 2012) as well as by epigenetic regulation via
histone deacetylase 4 (Sailaja et al. 2012). Also, contextual
fear conditioning increases pri-miR-132 levels in the hippocampus of chronically stressed rats (Meerson et al.
2010), as well as in the murine hippocampus (Ponomarev
et al. 2011). Overall, these studies present miR-1320 s
involvement in overcoming stress-induced damage to
protect cognitive function via its cholinergic control.
Surprisingly, the fraction of shared validated targets of
miR-132-3p in the two species is less than a half, although
miR-132 is fully conserved and 56–88% of the targets
present a conserved MRE (validated and predicted MREs,
respectively). One explanation could be that some of the
targets are yet to be validated. In addition, context-dependent mechanisms at the cell, tissue, or organism level
may potentially regulate miRNA-target interactions. Worth
mentioning is the case of hsa-miR-132-3p and hsa-miR212-3p that exhibit similar mature sequences and share the
same seed region, yet only few targets were demonstrated
to be targeted by both of them, and each of these miRNAs
may also repress specific targets (Wanet et al. 2012). A
related cell specific example was shown for miR-132 and
SIRT1 interaction. Repressive effects of miR-132 on the 30 UTR of SIRT1 were observed in HEK293T cells (Zhou
et al. 2012) and in the liver (Hanin et al. 2017). In contrast,
the SIRT1 30 -UTR failed to show similar effects in HepG2
cells, suggesting a context-specific regulation. Taking that
into consideration, extending one context to others based
on validation of targets in only one condition should be
considered carefully.
We performed numerous tests in search for potential
primate- and/or human-specific interactions of miR-1323p. Searching for differences between the regulation of
miR-132-3p in man and mice failed to identify any significant differences. We realize that the shared targets
identified in our study are only part of the predicted ones in
both species; nevertheless, the biological pathways controlled by these targets appear to be robustly shared. Furthermore, even when a predicted competition emerges with
another miRNA, such as in the case of the MECP2 gene
and miR-483, the spatial difference between the locations
of the corresponding MREs makes such competition
unlikely.
Another well-studied context of miR-132 is its activity
in the immune system, known to be functionally involved
in psychological stress responses (Mehta et al. 2015;
Molnár et al. 2012; Taganov et al. 2006). MiR-132 is
overexpressed in bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated primary human macrophages as well as in LPStreated mice, where it attenuates inflammation by

FDRs of selected common pathways, unique human pathways, and unique mouse pathways are shown

suppressing its stress-related target AChE (Shaked et al.
2009). This neuro-immune role (Soreq and Wolf 2011)
elevates acetylcholine levels and induces blockade of
NFkB-induced inflammation via the nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor alpha 7 (Tracey 2010). At the transcript level,
surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that miR-132
selectively targets the soluble splice variant of the acetylcholine hydrolyzing enzyme AChE-R (Mishra et al. 2017).

123

Consequently, mice expressing an AChE transgene devoid
of the miR-132 binding site develops high basal miR-132
expression levels, yet are incapable of controlling stress
(Shaltiel et al. 2013) or inflammation (Shaked et al. 2009)
via ACh. Taken together, these studies demonstrate interrelated stress/inflammation/neurodevelopment links for
miR-132 but failed to identify any evolutionary modifications in any of those, excluding an option of primate and/or

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2018) 38:141–153

human-specific roles for this context. MiRNA regulation of
stress responses thus emerges as being robustly preserved
throughout mammalian species, primates included.
