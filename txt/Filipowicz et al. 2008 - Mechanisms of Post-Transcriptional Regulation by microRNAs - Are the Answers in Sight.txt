Mechanisms of post-transcriptional
regulation by microRNAs: are the
answers in sight?
Witold Filipowicz*, Suvendra N. Bhattacharyya* and Nahum Sonenberg ‡

Abstract | MicroRNAs constitute a large family of small, approximately 21-nucleotide-long,
non-coding RNAs that have emerged as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene
expression in metazoans and plants. In mammals, microRNAs are predicted to control the
activity of approximately 30% of all protein-coding genes, and have been shown to
participate in the regulation of almost every cellular process investigated so far. By base
pairing to mRNAs, microRNAs mediate translational repression or mRNA degradation.
This Review summarizes the current understanding of the mechanistic aspects of
microRNA-induced repression of translation and discusses some of the controversies
regarding different modes of microRNA function.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are approximately 21nucleotide-long RNA regulators of gene expression1–3,
have become a major focus of research in molecular
biology. Although for a long time they were considered
to be exclusive to multicellular organisms and possibly
essential for the transition to a more complex organism design, the recent identification of miRNAs in the
unicellular algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii4,5 indicates that miRNAs are probably evolutionarily older
than originally thought. One to two hundred miRNAs
are expressed in lower metazoans and plants, but at
least a thousand are predicted to operate in humans.
Functional studies indicate that miRNAs participate
in the regulation of almost every cellular process
investigated and that changes in their expression are
observed in — and might underlie — human pathologies, including cancer1,2,6–8. These findings are perhaps
not so surprising as bioinformatic predictions indicate
that mammalian miRNAs can regulate ~30% of all
protein-coding genes.
With just one possible exception noted so far 9,
miRNAs control gene expression post-transcriptionally by regulating mRNA translation or stability in the
cytoplasm10–14. However, further functions of miRNAs
seem likely. For example, by virtue of base pairing to
RNA, miRNAs could regulate pre-mRNA processing
in the nucleus or act as chaperones that modify mRNA
structure or modulate mRNA–protein interactions.
Indications that mammalian miRNAs can be imported
into the nucleus15 or even secreted from the cell16 will

motivate searches for currently unidentified functions
for this class of molecule. What is already certain is that
the discovery of miRNAs has revealed an important new
dimension in the complexity of post-transcriptional
regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. We are beginning to understand why the 3′ UTRs of mRNA, with
which the miRNAs and other factors interact, are often
so long and so important for gene function.
The mechanistic details of the function of miRNAs in
repressing protein synthesis are still poorly understood.
miRNAs can affect both the translation and stability
of mRNAs, but the results from studies conducted in different systems and different laboratories have often been
contradictory: a comprehensive and lucid picture of the
mechanism of miRNA-mediated repression is difficult
to elaborate. In this Review, after briefly introducing
miRNAs and their biogenesis, we summarize what is
currently known about the mechanistic aspects of their
function in controlling mRNA stability and translation,
focusing primarily on animal cells. We also discuss the
cellular localization and reversibility of miRNA-mediated
repression. For further recent Reviews covering these
topics, see Refs 11–14,17,18, and more general information about the biogenesis, diversity and function of
miRNAs can be found in Refs 1–3,19–23.

the number of miRNA binding sites that are present in the 3′ UTR. Reporters that are devoid of microRNA binding
sites or that contain mutated sites are used as controls.

Principles of miRNA–mRNA interactions
In plants, miRNAs generally base pair to mRNAs
with nearly perfect complementarity and trigger
endonucleolytic mRNA cleavage by an RNAi-like
mechanism29. In rare instances, a similar mechanism
is used by vertebrate and viral miRNAs (see Ref. 21 for
examples). However, in most cases, metazoan miRNAs
pair imperfectly with their targets, following a set of
rules determined by experimental and bioinformatic
analyses30–34 (BOX 2). The most stringent requirement is
a contiguous and perfect base pairing of the miRNA
nucleotides 2–8, representing the ‘seed’ region, which
nucleates the interaction. With few exceptions, miRNAbinding sites in metazoan mRNAs lie in the 3′ UTR and
are usually present in multiple copies — this is required
for effective repression of translation30–34. miRNAs also
exert their repressive function when their binding sites
are artificially placed in 5′ UTRs or coding regions35,36,
although the physiological effects of the coding-region
sites might be only marginal37.

Modes of translational repression
mRNA translation can be divided into three steps: initiation, elongation and termination. Initiation starts with
the recognition of the mRNA 5′-terminal cap structure
m7GpppN (in which N is any nucleotide) by the eIF4E
subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor
(eIF) eIF4F, which also contains eIF4G, an important
scaffold for the assembly of the ribosome initiation
complex (BOX 3). Interaction of eIF4G with another
initiation factor, eIF3, facilitates the recruitment of the
40S ribosomal subunit38,39. eIF4G also interacts with
the polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABP1). The
ability of eIF4G to interact simultaneously with eIF4E
and PABP1 brings the two ends of the mRNA in close
proximity40,41. This ‘circularization’ stimulates translation initiation by increasing the affinity of eIF4E for
m7GpppN, and might facilitate ribosome recycling 41.
Some cellular and viral mRNAs initiate translation
independently of the m7G cap and eIF4E; in this case,
40S ribosomes are recruited to the mRNA through

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interact with their mRNA targets by baseNature
pairing.
In plants,
most
miRNAs base pair to mRNAs with nearly perfect complementarity and induce mRNA
degradation by an RNAi-like mechanism — the mRNA is cleaved endonucleolytically
in the middle of the miRNA–mRNA duplex29. By contrast, with few exceptions,
metazoan miRNAs base pair with their targets imperfectly, following a set of rules
that have been identified by experimental and bioinformatics analyses30–34.
• One rule for miRNA–target base paring is perfect and contiguous base pairing of
miRNA nucleotides 2 to 8, representing the ‘seed’ region (shown in dark red and
green), which nucleates the miRNA–mRNA association. GU pairs or mismatches
and bulges in the seed region greatly affect repression. However, an A residue across
position 1 of the miRNA, and an A or U across position 9 (shown in yellow), improve
the site efficiency, although they do not need to base pair with miRNA nucleotides.

• Another rule is that bulges or mismatches must be present in the central region of the
miRNA–mRNA duplex, precluding the Argonaute (AGO)-mediated endonucleolytic
cleavage of mRNA.
• The third rule is that there must be reasonable complementarity to the miRNA 3′ half to
stabilize the interaction. Mismatches and bulges are generally tolerated in this region,
although good base pairing, particularly to residues 13–16 of the miRNA (shown in
orange), becomes important when matching in the seed region is suboptimal31,33.
Other factors that can improve site efficacy include an AU‑rich neighbourhood
and, for long 3′ UTRs, a position that is not too far away from the poly(A) tail or the
termination codon; these factors can make the 3′ UTR regions less structured and
hence more accessible to miRNP recognition33,34,129. Indeed, accessibility of binding
sites might have an important effect on miRNA-mediated repression130. Some
experimentally characterized sites deviate significantly from these rules and can, for
example, even require a bulged nucleotide in the seed region pairing131,132. In addition,
combinations of sites can require a specific configuration (for example, separation by
a stretch of nucleotides of specific sequence and length) for efficient repression131.
Usually, miRNA-binding sites in metazoan mRNAs lie in the 3′ UTR and are present in
multiple copies. Importantly, multiple sites for the same or different miRNAs are
generally required for effective repression30–34. When they are present close to each
other (10–40 nucleotides apart) they tend to act cooperatively, that is, their effect
exceeds that expected from the independent contributions of two single sites30,33.

interaction with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)42.
Joining of the 60S subunit at the AUG codon precedes
the elongation phase of translation.
Although it is now clear that the effects of miRNAs
on protein synthesis can result from mRNA destabilization or translational repression, whether the latter
occurs at the initiation or post-initiation step (or both)
remains a matter of debate. Several recently published
papers provide important mechanistic insights into the
repression-at-the-initiation step, giving extra credence
to this model.

quent studies, the specificity of repression was assessed
using reporters containing mutated miRNA sites or by
antisense oligonucleotides that specifically block the
targeting miRNA. The conclusion that the m7G cap is
essential for translational repression was corroborated by
experiments with bi-cistronic mRNAs. In these experiments, the activity of the first cap-dependent cistron,
but not the second cistron, placed under the control
of eIF4E or eIF4G artificially tethered to the mRNA,
was repressed by the endogenous let‑7 miRNA43 (FIG. 1).
Polysome gradient analysis independently supports an
effect on the initiation step: reporter mRNAs that either
contained functional let-7-binding sites or that were
repressed by AGO2 (artificially tethered to the 3′ UTR)
showed a marked shift in sedimentation toward the top
of the gradient, indicating reduced ribosome loading
on the repressed mRNA43. Likewise, the amino-acidstarvation-induced release of endogenous cationic amino
acid transporter 1 (CAT1) mRNA from repression that
was mediated by the miRNA miR‑122 was accompanied by a more effective recruitment of CAT1 mRNA to
polysomes in human hepatoma cells45.
There is substantial evidence that factors bound at
the 3′ UTR exert their inhibitory effect on translational
initiation by recruiting proteins that either interfere with
the eIF4E–eIF4G interaction or bind directly to the cap
but, unlike eIF4E, are unable to associate with eIF4G
and promote assembly of the 40S initiation complex46–48.
Could miRNPs or tethered AGO proteins function in a
similar manner? Kiriakidou et al.49 recently reported that
the central domain of AGO proteins contains limited
sequence homology to the cap-binding region of eIF4E.
Importantly, the similarity includes two aromatic residues (FIG. 2), which are crucial for cap binding in eIF4E
and other cap-binding proteins49,50. Mutations of one or
both aromatic amino acids in AGO2 to valine but, significantly, not to other aromatic amino acids, prevented the
interaction with m 7GTP–Sepharose and abolished
the ability of AGO2 to repress translation when tethered
to the mRNA 3′ UTR. These data indicate that AGO2
and related proteins can compete with eIF4E for m7G
binding and thus prevent translation of capped, but
not IRES-containing, mRNAs49. The data also provide
a plausible explanation for the requirement of multiple
miRNPs or tethered AGO molecules for robust repression27,30,43,51. Multiple copies of AGO, with an apparently
lower affinity for m7G than eIF4E49, would increase the
likelihood of AGO association with the cap. It will be
important to determine whether the AGO aromatic
residues are essential for miRNA-mediated repression in
a physiological assay. Additional evidence, for example
from cross-linking experiments, should be obtained in
support of direct interaction of AGO with the mRNA
m7G cap structure.
Lessons from in vitro studies. Four different cell-free
extracts that recapitulate many features of the miRNAmediated in vivo effects have recently been described.
In all of them, the presence of the m7G cap was required
for translational repression52–55; the mRNAs containing

Translation of mRNA consists of three steps: initiation, elongation and termination.
Nature Reviews | Genetics
Initiation is the most complex step and is subject to a large number of
interventions, with the phosphorylation of initiation factors being the key
regulator133. Translation requires the participation of at least 10 initiation factors,
many of them multisubunit complexes38,39. Initiation of translation of most cellular
mRNAs starts with the recognition of the mRNA 5′-terminal 7‑methylguanosine
(m7G) cap (represented by the red circle in the figure) by the eukaryotic translation
initiation factor (eIF) 4E subunit of the initiation factor eIF4F, which also contains
eIF4A (an RNA helicase) and eIF4G (a large multidomain protein that functions as a
scaffold for the assembly of the translation initiation complex). Interaction of
eIF4G with another multi-subunit initiation factor, eIF3, facilitates the recruitment
of the 40S subunit, which then begins scanning the mRNA 5′ UTR in search of the
AUG (or in rare cases its cognate) initiation codon. Following the joining of the 60S
ribosomal subunit the elongation phase ensues. The elongation step can also be
regulated by phosphorylation of the elongation factor eEF2 (Ref. 134). When the
ribosome encounters a termination codon, translation release factors mediate
the termination process, in which the ribosomal subunits dissociate from both the
mRNA and from each other. An important function of eIF4G is its interaction with
the poly(A)-binding protein 1, PABP1, which is associated with the poly(A) tail. This
interaction brings about the circularization of the mRNA, which stimulates
translation initiation and possibly recycling of ribosomes40,41. eIF6 is required for
60S subunit biogenesis, and might also act as an initiation factor that regulates
subunit joining58–61. Some cellular and many viral mRNAs initiate translation
independently of the m7G cap and eIF4E, and sometimes also independently of
other initiation factors. During this mode of translation, ribosomes are recruited to
the mRNA through interaction with internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), which are
usually highly structured regions in the 5′-UTR. The best-studied IRES are those of
the encephalomyocarditis and polio viruses, hepatitis C virus and the insect cricket
paralysis virus. Bi-cistronic constructs, in which translation of the upstream cistron
requires the presence of the cap and eIF4E and that of the downstream
cistron requires internal initiation, are widely used as one of the means to identify
a putative IRES38,42 (FIG. 1).

an IRES or an ApppN cap were not inhibited53,54. Extracts
derived from D. melanogaster embryos and mouse
Krebs2 ascites cells were used to define the repression
step more precisely. In both systems, miRNAs inhibited
the association of mRNA with either the 40S or the 80S
ribosome, consistent with miRNAs targeting translation
initiation, probably at the 40S–mRNA complex assembly
step53,54. In agreement with the model that AGO proteins
compete with eIF4E for cap binding49, the addition of
purified initiation factor eIF4F to the ascites extract rescued mRNA from the miRNA-mediated inhibition54.
Extracts that were prepared from rabbit reticulocytes
and from human HEK293 cells were also tested for the
poly(A)-tail requirement55 — translational repression
occurred only when target mRNAs contained both
an m7G cap and a poly(A) tail. In the reticulocyte lysate,
m7G cap dependence could be partially relieved by the
addition of poly(A) tails of non-physiological length —
0.8 kb or longer — implying that polyadenylation might
have a role in miRNA-mediated repression52. Studies in
HEK293 cell extracts showed that mRNAs containing
miRNA-binding sites underwent deadenylation irrespective of whether they contained an m7G cap (translationally repressed mRNAs) or an ApppN cap or IRES
(non-repressed mRNAs). Thus, although the miRNAmediated deadenylation had no apparent effect on the
translation of IRES-containing or ApppN-containing
mRNAs, it might have contributed to the repression of
m7G-capped mRNAs by disrupting the eIF4G-mediated
mRNA circularization55.
Taken together, the data support the notion that by
targeting one of the two terminal mRNA structures,
miRNAs prevent the synergy between the 5′ cap and
3′ poly(A) tail. Notably, HEK293 cell lysate was supplemented with an extract of cells overexpressing GW182
(Ref. 55), a protein that recruits the CCR4–NOT deadenylation complex to the miRNA-bound mRNA (discussed below). Hence, in this system, miRNA-mediated
repression might be biased towards deadenylation. Of
the remaining three systems, the D. melanogaster and
mouse ascites extracts originated from non-modified
cells and responded to endogenous miRNPs53,54. By contrast, the repression in the reticulocyte lysate required
pre-annealing of the synthetic miRNA to the template
mRNA52. It is not known how effectively such a preformed miRNA–mRNA duplex associates with AGO
proteins and thus to what extent this system recapitulates
the physiological miRNA response. Interestingly, binding of miRNPs to the 3′ UTR in D. melanogaster extracts
resulted in the formation of heavy aggregates, termed
pseudo-polysomes, even in the absence of translation53.
Whether they are related to P‑bodies (discussed below)
remains unknown.
Data on the requirement of a poly(A) tail for repression in vitro differ from some findings obtained in intact
cells. Reporter RNA transcripts that were directly transfected to HeLa cells were repressed even in the absence
of a poly(A) tail. In one study 44, its presence resulted
in stronger repression, but this effect was not seen in a
different study 43. Although it is unlikely, the possibility
that the poly(A)-free RNA becomes polyadenylated in

the determination of the

mRNA. Repression of

with a shift of mRNA towards
the top of the gradient.

transfected cells was not excluded by these studies. With
this caveat in mind, the data suggest that a poly(A) tail
per se is not absolutely required for the repression, a
conclusion supported by the observation that mRNA
containing a 3′ histone stem-loop in place of a poly(A)
tail also undergoes translational repression in HEK293
cells56.
Repression by preventing 60S subunit joining. An alt­
ernative mechanism of miRNA action was recently
proposed by Chendrimada et al.57 The authors reported
that eIF6 and 60S ribosomal subunit proteins coimmunoprecipitate with the AGO2–Dicer–TRBP complex. eIF6 was first described as a protein that binds the
60S subunit to prevent its precocious interaction with
the 40S subunit58, and was thought to act as an initiation factor. However, it was shown later that eIF6 is not
involved in translation in yeast, but rather has a crucial
function (both in yeast and mammals) in the biogenesis
of the 60S subunit in the nucleolus, and accompanies the
60S subunit to the cytoplasm59–61. Chendrimada et al.57
showed that partial depletion of eIF6 in either human
cells or Caenorhabditis elegans rescues mRNA targets from miRNA inhibition, possibly by reducing
eIF6-mediated impediment of 60S joining.
The involvement of eIF6 in ribosome biogenesis
complicates the interpretation of the data that support its
role in miRNA repression, and invites another possible
scenario. Sachs and Davis62,63 demonstrated that mutations in a ribosomal protein and a helicase involved in
yeast 60S biogenesis could act as bypass suppressors of
complete deletion of the gene encoding poly(A) binding protein (Pab1). As in metazoans, the yeast Pab1 is
an essential protein, contributing to translation initiation through its function in mRNA circularization. The

bypass suppressor mutations, which all resulted in a 60S
ribosomal subunit deficit, allowed growth, albeit reduced,
in the absence of Pab1. This rescue can be explained
by an increase in the free 40S subunit pool (resulting
from a partial depletion of 60S ribosomes), leading
to an enhanced rate of their recruitment to mRNA.
This would partially compensate for the lack of Pab1,
which stimulates 40S recruitment, and would switch
the rate-limiting step from the 40S subunit-loading
step to the 60S joining step.
A similar switch, negating the advantages of the
circularization of bulk mRNAs, could be caused by
the knockdown of eIF6. The resulting limited 60S deficit57 would bring some relief of the miRNA-mediated
repression, because the target mRNAs could now compete with the bulk of mRNAs on a more equal footing.
If this explanation is correct, the work of Chendrimada
et al.57 would be consistent with the idea that miRNAmediated repression affects the initiation of translation
by targeting the 5′ cap and poly(A) tail, although perhaps
not because of a direct involvement of eIF6 in repression. Admittedly, this model does not explain why eIF6
co-purifies with the RISC.
Repression at post-initiation steps. Despite compelling
in vitro and in vivo evidence, targeting of translation
initiation is unlikely to be the only mechanism by which
miRNAs bring about mRNA repression. Early studies in
C. elegans showed that lin‑14 and lin‑28 mRNAs, which
are targets of lin‑4 miRNA, remain associated with
polysomes despite a strong reduction in their protein
products at a specific stage of larval development64,65.
Similar results, which are incompatible with the initiation model, were seen in mammalian cells. In two studies
that used reporter mRNAs targeted by either synthetic

(AGO2) and Drosophila melanogaster GW182, two proteins extensively characterized in mediating the microRNA
(miRNA)-mediated repression. AGO2 is the only mammalian AGO protein that, in addition to miRNA repression, also
functions in RNAi. Its RNAseH-like P-element induced wimpy testis (PIWI) domain is competent in endonucleolytically
cleaving the mRNA. The region separating the PIWI Argonaute Zwille (PAZ) and PIWI domains of AGO2 contains two
aromatic amino acids (phenylalanines F470 and F505), mutation of which was reported to prevent both the repression of
translation in the AGO2 tethering assay and the binding of AGO2 to 7‑methylguanosine triphosphate (m7GTP)Sepharose49. D. melanogaster contains only one GW182 protein78,136 but there are three GW182 paralogues in mammals
(known as TNRC6A–C). One related protein, AIN1, is expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans90. N‑GW, M‑GW and C‑GW are
regions enriched in glycine (G)–tryptophan (W) dipeptides. The N‑GW domain or shorter GW‑repeats-containing
peptides were shown to mediate interaction of GW182 proteins with the PIWI domain of AGO proteins78,94. The region
extending from the N terminus to the glutamine‑rich domain is responsible for targeting GW182 to P‑bodies78. DUF,

or endogenous miRNAs 66,67, the repressed mRNAs
associated with active polysomes — as demonstrated by
sensitivity of the polysomes to different conditions that
inhibit translation. Moreover, Peterson et al.66 found that,
like the cap-dependent upstream ORF, IRES-mediated
translation of the downstream ORF in the bi-cistronic
reporter is sensitive to miRNAs. Drawing on additional
data, the authors proposed a drop-off model, in which
miRNAs render ribosomes prone to premature termination of translation. Lytle et al. also reported repression of
IRES-containing reporters35.
The observation that three endogenous miRNAs and
KRAS mRNA, a known target of let‑7 miRNA, cosediment with polysomes led Maroney et al.68 to conclude
that repression occurs at a post-initiation step. Because
puromycin or hypertonic conditions — factors causing
general inhibition of translation — shifted polysomeassociated miRNAs towards the top of the gradient
during polysome gradient analyses, whereas the shift
of KRAS mRNA was only partial, the authors proposed that miRNAs decelerate translation elongation.
Cosedimentation of a significant fraction of cellular
miRNAs or AGO proteins with polysomes has also
been reported in other studies69–71 and is often quoted
in support of the post-initiation mechanism. However,
it should be stressed that repression of mRNA targets by
miRNAs is generally only partial, and binding of a single
miRNP to mRNA frequently has no significant effect
(see REFS 43,51 for examples). Hence, cosedimentation of
miRNPs with polysomes is not necessarily diagnostic
of post-initiation repression, but might simply reflect
the association of miRNPs with mRNAs undergoing
productive translation.
How miRNAs could modulate the elongation or
termination process remains unclear. Apart from the
proposed miRNA-mediated control, few other examples of regulation targeting post-initiation steps have
been reported. Repression of pal1 mRNA by gld1 in
C. elegans seems to involve the stalling or slowing down
of elongating ribosomes72, as does translational repression of unspliced HAC1 mRNA in yeast73. Other examples include nanos and oskar mRNAs in D. melanogaster
embryos74,75, although the proposed mode of their
regulation has recently been either reinterpreted or
questioned 46,76. Despite undeniable evidence that
translational repression by miRNAs can occur by postinitiation mechanisms, the findings do not demonstrate
unequivocally that the initiation and post-initiation
mechanisms are mutually exclusive. It is possible that initiation is always inhibited, but when the elongation step
is also repressed, ribosomes would queue on the mRNA,
thereby masking the effect of an initiation block.
The association of repressed mRNAs with translationally competent polysomes has also fuelled speculations that proteins are continually synthesized from these
mRNAs but do not accumulate because they are rapidly
degraded by proteases recruited by miRNPs64 (FIG. 3).
This possibility has been experimentally addressed; in
immunoprecipitation experiments, nascent polypeptides produced from the repressed reporter could not
be detected67. Likewise, in pulse-labelling experiments,
108 | february 2008 | volume 9

neither full-length nor nascent polypeptides could be
identified when the reporter mRNA was repressed66.
On the other hand, repression was not prevented when
reporter proteins were targeted to the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). This excludes the possibility that nascent
proteins are degraded in the cytosol43. In conclusion,
the proteolysis proposal is at present based on negative
rather than positive data. Proteasome inhibitors had no
effect on miRNA-mediated repression43,66,67 and other
proteases have not been identified.

mRNA deadenylation and decay
Although initial studies suggested that the levels of
miRNA-inhibited mRNAs remain mostly unchanged,
more recent work has demonstrated that the repression of many miRNA targets is frequently associated
with their destabilization56,77–80 (FIG. 3). Likewise, microarray studies of transcript levels in cells and tissues
in which the miRNA pathway was inhibited78,79,81–83, or in
which miRNA levels were experimentally altered84–87,
revealed marked changes in the abundance of dozens of
validated or predicted miRNA targets, consistent with a
role for miRNAs in mRNA destabilization.
In eukaryotes, mRNA degradation can follow two
pathways, each of which is initiated by a gradual shortening of the mRNA poly(A) tail. The mRNA body can
then be degraded by progressive 3′→5′ decay, which is
catalysed by the exosome, or by the removal of the cap
followed by 5′→3′ degradation, which is catalysed by
the exonuclease XRN1 (ref. 88). Levels of mRNA are
controlled by mRNPs through the recruitment of decay
machinery components, leading to mRNA deadenylation and decapping. The degradation, or at least its final
steps, is thought to occur in P‑bodies — cellular structures that are enriched in mRNA-catabolizing enzymes
and translational repressors17,89 (BOX 4).
The mechanism of miRNA-mediated mRNA destabilization is best understood in D. melanogaster. Studies
in D. melanogaster S2 cells demonstrated that the P‑body
protein GW182 (product of the gawky gene), which
interacts with the miRNP Argonaute1 (the interaction
also occurs between mammalian and worm orthologues90–93), is a key factor that marks mRNAs for decay78.
The AGO PIWI domain and glycine–tryptophan (GW)
dipeptide‑containing domains or peptides of GW182
family proteins are important for this interaction78,94
(FIG. 2). Consistent with its role in mediating mRNA
degradation, GW182 depletion leads to an upregulation
of many mRNA targets that are also upregulated in cells
that are depleted of Argonaute1. Tethering of GW182
to the mRNA bypasses the Argonaute1 requirement for
repression, further demonstrating that GW182 functions in the same pathway downstream of Argonaute1.
Depletion of the components of the CCR4–NOT
deadenylating complex prevents the decay-promoting
activity of GW182, suggesting that it plays a part in
recruiting CCR4–NOT to repressed mRNAs. Likewise,
the knockdown of the decapping-complex proteins,
DCP1 and DCP2, or different combinations of decapping
activators, prevents miRNA-mediated degradation but
leads to an accumulation of deadenylated mRNAs78,83.

Binding of micro-ribonucleoproteins (miRNPs), possibly complexed with accessory factors, to mRNA 3′ UTR can induce
56,78,79,83
deadenylation and decay of target mRNAs
(upper left). Alternatively, miRNPs can repress translation initiation
at either the cap-recognition stage43,44,53–55 or the 60S subunit joining stage57 (bottom left). mRNAs repressed by
deadenylation or at the translation-initiation stage are moved to P‑bodies for either degradation or storage. The
repression can also occur at post-initiation phases of translation66–68, owing to either slowed elongation or ribosome
‘drop-off’ (bottom right). Proteolytic cleavage of nascent polypeptides was also proposed as a mechanism of the
miRNA-induced repression of protein production67 (upper-right). A protease (X) that might be involved in the process
has not been identified. The 7-methylguanosine cap is represented by a red circle. eIF4E, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E.

Accelerated deadenylation also results in a reduced
abundance of miRNA-repressed mRNAs in mammalian
cells56. Moreover, knockdown experiments in C. elegans77,
and analysis of the decay intermediates originating from
repressed mRNAs in worms77 and mammalian cells56,82,
support the role of decapping and 5′→3′ exonucleolytic
activities in these systems.
Widespread miRNA-mediated deadenylation
of mRNAs occurs during zebrafish embryogenesis.
The miRNA miR‑430 facilitates the removal of hundreds
of maternal mRNAs by inducing their deadenylation and
subsequent decay at the onset of zygotic transcription79.
Interestingly, some miR‑430 targets, such as nanos1 and
tudor-like tdrd7 mRNAs, are repressed by miR‑430 in
somatic but not germ cells, indicating that target destabilization and/or repression can be tissue or cell specific95.
Likewise, mRNA reporters targeted by let‑7 miRNA are
destabilized to different degrees in different mammalian
cell lines82.
Although many of the mRNAs that are targeted by
miRNAs undergo substantial destabilization, there are
also numerous examples of repression at the translational level, with no or only a minimal effect on mRNA
decay (Supplementary information S1 (table)). Studies
using D. melanogaster S2 cells identified some endogenous or reporter miRNA targets, for which repression
nature reviews | genetics

could be entirely accounted for by either mRNA
degradation or translational repression, or by a combination of both processes78,83. It is not known what
determines whether an mRNA follows the degradation or
translational-repression pathway. Accessory proteins
bound to the 3′ UTR might be involved, or structural subtleties of imperfect miRNA–mRNA duplexes, particularly
of their central regions, could be important82,96.
Whether the deadenylation and the ensuing decay
are primary or secondary to the translational repression remains unknown. Clearly, the association of
AGO instead of eIF4E with the m7G cap would not
only prevent effective recruitment of ribosomes, but
would also disrupt the circularization of the mRNA,
probably rendering the poly(A) tail more vulnerable
to exonucleolytic degradation. Experiments that have
been carried out to explore whether deadenylation is
a primary or secondary event have not proved to be
conclusive. Reporter mRNAs that are repressed by
either oligonucleotides that are complementary to the
AUG codon or the 5′ UTR hairpins do not undergo
deadenylation unless they contain miRNA sites79,80.
However, it is unlikely that mRNA circularization is
disrupted by the oligonucleotide or the hairpin, both
of which act at some distance from the cap. By contrast,
the disruption could be effected by the miRNP AGO

interacting with the cap. Perhaps the strongest support
for deadenylation as a primary event comes from the
finding that the translationally inactive ApppN-capped
mRNA (which does not interact with eIF4E and hence is
unable to circularize) is deadenylated when injected into
zebrafish embryos only when it contains miR‑430 sites
in its 3′ UTR95. This, and other experiments56,79,83, indicate that miRNA-dependent mRNA deadenylation and
decay is not dependent on active translation, although
examples of mRNA targets, decay of which requires
ongoing translation, have also been reported83.

Pat1 (or the Drosophila melanogaster orthologue CG5208, also known as HPat),
RAP55 (Scd6 in yeast), and EDC3 (Edc3 in yeast) and the heptameric LSm1–7
complex. Metazoa contain yet another decapping activator, Ge‑1 or Hedls. P‑bodies
also contain other mRNA decay enzymes: the deadenylase complex CAF1–CCR4–
NOT and the 5′→3′ exonuclease XRN1 (Refs 17,89). Some proteins involved in
nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and other mRNA degradation pathways are
also enriched in P‑bodies. P‑bodies lack ribosomes and all translation initiation
factors with the exception of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E. However, eIF4G
and Pab1 accumulate in P‑bodies under specific repressive conditions in yeast99.
In metazoa, P‑bodies are enriched in proteins participating in miRNA repression —
Argonaute (AGO) proteins and GW182 — and miRNAs themselves. Consistent with
their localization, AGO and GW182 proteins and miRNAs interact, directly or
indirectly, with different P‑body components43,78,90,92,93,100,104,108 (see figure). The
decapping activators RCK/p54 and Pat1, and another P‑body-resident protein 4E‑T,
have the ability to repress translation, with some affecting the initiation step. These
proteins can contribute to the repressive function of miRNAs78,83,91–93,104,106,107,109.
P-bodies are highly dynamic structures, fluctuating in size and number during the
cell cycle and in response to changes in the translational status of the cell. They
require a continuous supply of repressed mRNAs, and a global translation-initiation
block leads to an increase in P‑body size in yeast and metazoa; inhibition of
elongation by cycloheximide, which retains mRNAs on polysomes, results in their
dispersion17,89. Likewise, depletion of some P‑body components has a strong effect on
their integrity, at least as visualized by microscopy. The mRNAs targeted to P‑bodies
either undergo degradation or are stored there for future use.
Stress granules (SGs)97 are another type of mRNA-containing cytoplasmic
aggregates, formed in response to global repression of translation initiation or to
various stress conditions. Many proteins found in P‑bodies are absent from SGs and
vice versa. However, they share some proteins, and P‑bodies and SGs are frequently
located adjacent to each other, possibly exchanging their cargo material115,135.

Compartmentalization of miRNA repression
Translationally inactive eukaryotic mRNAs generally assemble into repressive mRNPs that accumulate
in discrete cytoplasmic foci known as P‑bodies or
GW‑bodies17,89. Another type of aggregate that contains
repressed mRNAs are stress granules (SGs), which accumulate in response to various stress conditions97 (BOX 4).
Originally considered as being primarily involved in
mRNA degradation17,89, P‑bodies are now known to
also be temporary sites of storage for repressed mRNAs
in yeast and mammals45,98,99. The demonstration that
AGO proteins, miRNAs and mRNAs repressed by
miRNAs are all enriched in P‑bodies43,45,78,92,93,100,101 implicated P‑bodies in miRNA repression and in the fate of
repressed mRNAs. Relevant data are emerging, although
their interpretation is sometimes difficult owing to the
lack of a precise definition of P‑bodies (microscopicallyvisible versus submicroscopic) and limited information
on the distribution of miRNP components and other
factors between P‑bodies and the cytosol.
There is a good correlation between miRNAmediated translational repression and accumulation
of mRNAs in visible P‑bodies43,45,100,102. Moreover, there
is an inverse relationship between P‑body localization
and polysome association of target mRNAs in mammalian cells43,45,102. The endogenous CAT1 mRNA, a
target of miR‑122, localizes to P‑bodies when translation is repressed but not when it is reversed by stress.
In addition, transfection of miR‑122 into cells that
normally do not express it is sufficient to concentrate
CAT1 mRNA in P‑bodies45. So far, quantitative data
on the cytosolic distribution of P‑bodies are available
only for let‑7 miRNA and its reporter mRNA target,
both of which are ectopically expressed in HeLa cells.
Approximately 20% of each RNA was localized to visible
P‑bodies43, indicating that the repression either involves
submicroscopic P‑bodies or occurs outside them. Note
also that the knockdown of some P‑body components
(such as LSM1 or LSM3), which results in dispersion
of microscopic P‑bodies, has no effect on miRNA function103,104. Hence, the microscopically visible P‑bodies
are not essential for repression, and their formation is
a consequence rather than the cause of silencing43,103.
These data are consistent with the recent analysis of yeast
cells that demonstrate that submicroscopic mRNPs, containing a set of core P‑body components, are sufficient
for basic control of translation repression and mRNA
decay105. ��������������������������������������������
In contrast to knockdowns of LSM1 and LSM3,
depletion��������������������������������������������
of other P‑body components such as DCP1 or
DCP2, GW182, and various decapping activators, either
individually (for example, RCK/p54) or in combinations,
prevents efficient inhibition of target mRNAs in cultured
cells78,83,91–93,104,106,107.
Notwithstanding the above findings, a functional
miRNA pathway is clearly essential for the formation
of large P‑body aggregates. Global inhibition of miRNA
biogenesis or depletion of the proteins that are involved
in miRNA repression, such as GW182 or Argonaute1,
results in strong dispersal of visible P‑bodies in mammalian and D. melanogaster S2 cells103,108. Interestingly,

have several cis-acting motifs interacting with different RNA binding proteins (RBPs)

translatability or stability. The suppressive effect of the 3′ UTR-binding protein
ELAV1 on the miRNA-mediated repression (not shown) has recently been
documented45. However, it is possible that RBPs will also interact with miRNPs to

Most P‑body components, including AGO proteins,
are also found throughout the cytosol17. Hence, it is probable that repression by miRNPs is initiated in the cytosol

RCK/p54 and GW182 can be enrolled directly through
their interaction with AGO proteins78,94,104, recruitment
of others might occur through RCK/p54 or GW182.
Surprisingly, only ~1.3% of enhanced GFP (EGFP)tagged AGO2 localized to P‑bodies in HeLa cells101.
Moreover, the P‑body-associated EGFP–AGO2
exchanged with the cytoplasm at a much slower rate
than DCP1–DCP2 or LSM6, the P‑body components
involved in decapping 101,113; GW182 also exchanges
slowly at P‑bodies115. Rationalization of these observations is difficult at present. P‑bodies could consist of
compartments with differing component dynamics43,116.
Alternatively, miRNPs and associated proteins, such
as GW182, could be ‘anchored’ to some cytoplasmic
structures and not be readily available for diffusion
into the pre-existing photo-bleached P‑bodies. In
support of this model, most cellular AGO proteins
fractionate with the ER or Golgi117,118. Moreover, following permeabilization of the plasma membrane, only
a small fraction of AGO2 is readily extractable and is
probably cytosolic43. However, the observation that the
EGFP–AGO2 that accumulates in SGs following stress,
or treatment with initiation inhibitors, exchanges rapidly with the cytosolic AGO2 pool101 is at odds with the
nature reviews | genetics

anchoring model. Association of AGO proteins with
mRNAs stored in P‑bodies, but not those undergoing
degradation, could be another explanation for their low
enrichment in these structures.
Leung et al.101 found that, in addition to AGO proteins, miRNA mimics and the repressed reporter mRNA
accumulate in SGs. Moreover, the localization of AGO
proteins to SGs but not P‑bodies was miRNA-dependant.
Because SGs are now known to form not only in
response to stress but also following general inhibition of translational initiation18,119, SGs (like P‑bodies)
might have a role in the miRNA-mediated regulation of translation18,101. Alternatively, localization of
miRNP components to SGs might reflect dragging
of the mRNA-associated, but not necessarily inhibitory,
miRNPs to SGs that are formed in response to general
translational inhibition. This scenario could also explain
why the localization of AGO to SGs, but not to P‑bodies,
is miRNA dependent: AGO proteins directly interact
with other P‑body components78,94,104 but their localization to SGs might require assembly into miRNP to allow
association with mRNA by base pairing.

Reversibility of miRNA-mediated repression
Recent findings indicate that under certain conditions,
or in specific cells, miRNA-mediated repression can be
effectively reversed or prevented45,95,120,121, and miRNPs
or their components can even act as translational activators71. The ability to disengage miRNPs from the
repressed mRNA, or render them stimulatory, makes
miRNA regulation much more wide-ranging and
dynamic.
In human hepatoma cells, CAT1 mRNA is translationally repressed by the liver-specific miR‑122 and
accumulates in P‑bodies. Following amino-acid starvation or other types of stress, CAT1 mRNA is released
from P‑bodies and recruited to polysomes, in a process that depends on binding of ELAVL1 (also known
as HuR), a member of the embryonic lethal abnormal
vision (ELAV) protein family, to the CAT1 3′ UTR.
APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme
catalytic polypeptide-like 3G), also interferes with the
miRNA action, possibly by altering the distribution of
target messages between P‑bodies and polysomes102.
Other examples of the reversible action of miRNAs
have been reported in neuronal cells. In neurons, some
mRNAs are transported along the dendrites as repressed
mRNPs to become translated at dendritic spines upon
synaptic activation122. miR‑134 is implicated in the regulation of LIMK1, a protein kinase that is important for
the development of the spine. In response to extracellular stimuli, miR‑134-mediated repression of Limk1
mRNA is partially relieved at dendritic spines of
rat neurons120. In D. melanogaster, stimulation of olfactory neurons is associated with proteolysis of the armitage
(armi) protein, which is essential for the assembly of
miRNPs. Following armi degradation, mRNAs that are
normally repressed by miRNAs become translated at
the synapse121. Given that many miRNAs are specifically
expressed in the brain123, and that three of the four mammalian ELAV proteins — ELAV2, ELAV3 and ELAV4

REVIEWS
(also known as HuB, HuC and HuD) — are restricted to
neurons124, reversible miRNA regulation might have a
general role in brain development and function.
It is likely that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) other
than ELAV proteins act as modifiers of miRNA-mediated
repression. miR‑430 repression of nanos1 and tdrd7
mRNAs in somatic but not germline cells can be attributed to a specific 3′ UTR-binding protein that prevents
miR‑430 function in germline cells95. Intriguingly,
together with the FMRP-related protein FXR1, AGO2
(possibly as a part of an miRNP) acts as an activator of
translation when bound to the 3′ UTR of tumour necrosis factor‑α mRNA in serum-starved human cells71. This
finding possibly reveals one of many potential combinations of the interplay between the miRNPs and RBPs that
are interacting with mRNA 3′ UTRs. Because RBPs such
as ELAV1 can act as translational activators by interfering with the miRNP-mediated repression of translation,
it is also possible that miRNPs might act as translational
activators by either displacing or modulating inhibitory
RBPs bound at the 3′ UTR. Likewise, in other circumstances, miRNPs and RBPs might act synergistically to
either repress or activate mRNA translation (FIG. 4).

Conclusions and prospects
Perhaps the paramount open question is whether
miRNAs inhibit protein synthesis by a primary single
mechanism or by different mechanisms. In other words, is
it possible that miRNAs trigger an initial event that
is then amplified by different mechanisms? On the
basis of the many lines of evidence, it is widely believed
that miRNAs suppress protein synthesis by a bevy of
mechanisms. Although this could be the case, it is too
early to draw this conclusion with certainty. A simple,
alternative mechanistic model posits that the earliest
event in protein-synthesis repression is the inhibition of
cap-dependent translation through the binding of AGO
to the cap structure. Secondary effects of this inhibition
could then be manifested at other steps, such as mRNA
degradation or proteolysis of the nascent polypeptide
chains. It is conceivable that the different outcomes
of the miRNA repression experiments occur partially
because of the different experimental systems and
methodologies. Although the use of in vitro systems
allows identification and biochemical characterization
of early events during repression, the reporter mRNAs
lack a nuclear history that could involve deposition of
RBPs that modify the mRNA properties and affect the
response to miRNAs. The same applies to the in vitro
transcribed mRNAs that were transfected into cultured

cells. Indeed, differences in the outcome of miRNAmediated repression have been reported, depending
on whether RNA or DNA was used for transfection, or
even on the method of transfection35. Finally, it should
be recognized that the steps that limit protein expression
can differ among different transfected reporter genes or
in vitro transcribed mRNAs10.
It will be crucial to understand the regulation of
miRNA function through modulation of the activity
of RISC components and associated factors, possibly
by phosphorylation and other protein modifications.
Thus, the involvement of different signalling pathways
in the control of miRNA function should be studied. It
is also highly likely that the mechanisms that control
translation initiation will have a significant impact on
miRNA-regulated gene expression. It will also be important to determine the precise contributions of different
cellular structures, such as P‑bodies and SGs, to miRNAmediated repression of translation. The fact that miRNA
function can be recapitulated in cell-free extracts argues
against a primary and essential role of P‑bodies and SGs in
miRNA repression, inasmuch as these microscopic structures are unlikely to exist in cell-free extracts. However,
pseudo-polysomes that are formed in extracts from
D. melanogaster embryos53 might contain constituents
of P‑bodies, and it will be interesting to find out if this
is indeed the case. The availability of cell-free systems
to study miRNA function is a significant development.
It is hoped that these systems will generate a detailed
and precise mechanistic picture of the miRNA-mediated
inhibition of protein synthesis, as has been accomplished
for transcription, translation and splicing.
Finally, a complete and accurate understanding of the
mechanism of miRNA function will require elucidation
of three‑dimensional structures of animal AGO proteins,
their complexes with the miRNA and the cap structure,
and ultimately the structure of miRNP bound to mRNA.
Structural information would help validate or refute the
current models for miRNA function.

Note added in proof
Two papers have recently appeared which add new
information about the miRNA-mediated repression.
Vasudevan et al.137 showed that while miRNAs repress
translation in proliferating mammalian cells, they
induce translation upregulation of target mRNAs upon
cell-cycle arrest. Kedde et al.138 identified dead end 1
(Dnd1) as a protein that, by binding to the target mRNA
3′UTR, counteracts the function of miRNAs in human
cells and zebrafish germ cells.
