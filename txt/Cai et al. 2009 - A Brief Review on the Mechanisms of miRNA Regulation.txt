MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short, endogenously-initiated non-coding
RNAs that post-transcriptionally control gene expression via either translational
repression or mRNA degradation. It is becoming evident that miRNAs are playing signif icant roles in regulatory mechanisms operating in various organisms,
including developmental timing and host-pathogen interactions as well as cell
dif ferentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis. Likewise, as a regulatory element, miRNA itself is coordinatively modulated by multifarious ef fectors
when carrying out basic functions, such as SNP, miRNA editing, methylation and
circadian clock. This mini-review summarized the current understanding of interactions between miRNAs and their targets, including recent advancements in
deciphering the regulatory mechanisms that control the biogenesis and functionality of miRNAs in various cellular processes.
Key words: non-coding RNA, miRNA, miRNA regulation, targets

Introduction
MicroRNAs or miRNAs, a subset of non-coding
RNAs, are ∼22-nt long endogenously-initiated short
RNA molecules that are considered to posttranscriptionally regulate the cleavage of target mRNAs or just repress their translation (1 ). It is estimated that miRNAs constitute nearly 1% of all predicted genes in nematodes, flies and mammals (2–5 ).
The significance of miRNAs had been long overlooked
due to the limitation of technology and methodology
until its initial discovery that two miRNAs, lin-4 and
let-7, were found to control the timing of the nematode (Caenorbabditis elegans) development through
incomplete base pairing to the 3 UTRs of the target
mRNAs to repress their translation (6 , 7 ). Shortly
after that, Reinhart et al detected the existence of
miRNAs in Arabidopsis by Northern blot and the result suggests that this type of non-coding RNAs may
arise early in eukaryotic evolution (8 ). Thereafter,
an increasing number of miRNAs have been successively identified through computational and experimental methods in animals, plants and even viruses.
The regulatory roles of miRNAs have been identified
not only in developmental timing, cell differentiation,
proliferation and apoptosis, but also in tumorigenesis
and host-pathogen interactions (9–14 ).
It has been shown that miRNA genes frequently

coincide with fragile sites and hot spots for chromosomal abnormalities or locate near cancer susceptibility
loci that correlate with tumorigenesis (15–17 ). Although a large number of miRNA genes disperse over
the genome, clustered ones are found coexpressed as
polycistronic units that may have functional relationships (5 ). In addition, more than half of miRNAs
reside in introns of their host genes and coexpress
with their neighboring protein-coding sequences, and
some may derive from common primary transcripts
and even share the same promoters (5 , 18–20 ). Nevertheless, a sizable number of miRNA genes come
from regions that are distal from previously annotated protein-coding sequences and such locations imply that they probably derive from independent transcription units with their own promoters (1 ). A picture over the long course of evolution emerges, in
which miRNAs originate from different mechanisms
to perform functional roles for the best utilization of
genome materials.
miRNAs have several distinct features as compared to other functional RNA species. First, most of
the known miRNAs are encoded as polycistronic transcripts, suggesting that members of the same miRNA
family may evolve simultaneously and develop in similar ways. Second, it has been known that a conVol. 7 No. 4

siderable number of miRNAs are highly conserved in
sequences among different organisms and the crossspecies conserved miRNAs possess a special “seed”
sequence in their 5 terminus; such a conservation
suggests that these molecules participate in critical
cellular processes (17 ). Third, miRNAs tend to target and regulate a set of mRNAs instead of a specific
mRNA substrate. Fourth, direct experimental evidence supports the notion that the miRNA pathway
is an ancient regulatory mechanism evolved before the
divergence of multicellular and unicellular organisms
(21 ). Finally, special cases among viruses are worthy mentioning: due to their higher mutation rates
and faster evolution processes, most viral miRNAs do
not seem to share significant homology with those of
their vertebrate counterparts, even within members of
the same family (10 ). A reasonable explanation links
this phenomenon with their rapid adaptation to host
environments, and the lack of homology poses challenges for computational biologists to precisely predict miRNAs based on sequence conservations alone.
It is noticeable that, with the development of the
next-generation sequencing technologies and other endeavors, miRNAs from various species are springing
up in an inconceivable speed and greatly enrich the
database (22–24 ).

It has been shown that an individual miRNA is able
to control the expression of more than one target mRNAs and that each mRNA may be regulated by multiple miRNAs. The 5 region of miRNA usually contributes more to the specificity and activity in binding targets according to experimental evidence. The
interactions between miRNA and mRNA are usually
restricted to the “seed” sequence near the 5 terminus in animals despite the fact that most plant miRNAs regulate their targets based on complete complementarity (25 ). The ∼6 to 8-nt “seed” sequence
is highly conserved among species and even a slight
change in sequence may alter its target spectra. It
is also suggested that the location of central loop in
the miRNA:mRNA duplexes may play a key role in
affecting the efficiency of gene regulation mediated
by miRNAs (26 ). Current target prediction programs
depend on the information from sequence, structureassociated free energy and evolutionary conservation
to predict candidate mRNAs (27 , 28 ). Those bioin-

formatic methods usually result in the prediction of
tens or hundreds of targets for each miRNA with high
false positive rates (29 ). Therefore, further experiments of gain-of-function and loss-of-function are still
needed and will determine how many of these predicted targets are genuinely targeted by miRNAs.
miRNAs control the target expression by base
pairing to sequence motifs in the 3 UTR of mRNAs with perfect or near perfect complementarities
(30 , 31 ). For example, in Drosophila, a large number
of miRNAs have been identified to perfectly complement to the 3 UTR of mRNAs, including K box, Brd
box, GY box and proneural box, which are validated
to mediate negative post-transcriptional regulation
(30 ). Recently, certain AU-rich elements in 3 UTR
were uncovered to interact with miRNAs and act both
directly and indirectly as potent post-transcriptional
regulatory signals (32 ). Analysis of the miRNA target sites indicated that genes with longer 3 UTRs
usually have higher density of miRNA-binding sites
and are mainly involved in developmental modulations, whereas genes with shorter 3 UTRs usually
have lower density of miRNA-binding sites and tend
to be involved in basic cellular processes (33–35 ).
These facts emphasize the importance of 3 UTR in
interacting with miRNAs. It is also claimed that a
small subset of miRNAs from plants and animals exert repression regulation by specifically targeting the
5 UTR of some mRNAs (36 , 37 ). Lee et al suggested
that based on both hybridization energy and sequence
matches, many endogenous motifs within human 5
UTRs are specific to the 3 ends of miRNAs (38 ). In
other words, many miRNAs may contain significant
interaction sites with mRNA 5 -UTR and 3 -UTR motifs through their 3 - and 5 -end sequences, respectively. Recently, it has been reported that methods
integrating factors such as 5 UTR and protein repression level into the sophisticated target prediction processes greatly improved the possibility of identifying
real targets (38 , 39 ). In addition, candidate target
sites of miRNAs falling in the protein-coding regions
are also identifiable based on computational and experimental approaches (36 , 40 , 41 ). The fact that 3
UTR is a significant yet not the only binding target
for miRNAs leaves one possibility open, that is, miRNAs identify their targets by multiple pathways or
modes (42 ).
The impact of the interaction between miRNAs
and their targets is further complicated than it was
thought. Given the observation that miR-122, a liverspecific miRNA, binds to the 5 non-coding region of

the RNA HCV (hepatitis C virus) genome and induces
the accumulation of viral RNAs, it seems that miR122 can act on viral RNA replication rather than RNA
translation or stability (37 ). In addition, Vasudevan
and collaborators demonstrated that miRNAs oscillate between repression and activation in the duration of a cell cycle, and they identified miR369-3 in
proliferating cells, which represses the translation of
targets but switches to mediate activation process in
cell-cycle arrest (G1/G0) (43 ). miRNAs also appear
to activate certain mRNA targets in stress conditions,
such as hypoxia and nutrient deprivation (43 , 44 ).
Whether these up-regulation phenomena happen in
special conditions or in ubiquitous regulatory mechanisms remains to be further illustrated.

The Stringent
miRNAs

Regulation

of

Regulators of gene expression generally stand in a
complicated network; likewise, miRNAs themselves
are coordinatively modulated by different effectors
when carrying out basic functions. As we know, a
growing body of miRNAs shows development- and
tissue-specific regulation mechanisms although a considerable amount of known miRNAs are expressed
universally in various tissues and species (45 ). Accordingly, it is inferred that accurate regulation networks may exist in order to regulate the biogenesis and functions of miRNAs. It is noteworthy that
the multiple steps in miRNA biogenesis appear to
be a cooperated procedure and their influences are
already reported (46 ). In addition, other factors,
such as sequence-specific RNA binding proteins with
double-strand RNA binding domains (dsRBDs), are
also known to regulate and control the function of
miRNAs (47–49 ). Herein, we mainly focused on additional mechanisms (SNP, RNA editing, methylation
and circadian clock) that all play important roles in
controlling the expression and function of miRNAs.

The impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms
Ample evidence has emerged and supported the idea
that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), created
by changes in DNA sequences of miRNA-coding genes
or in an miRNA-binding site in mRNAs, are able to
affect the biogenesis and function of miRNA. Many
miRNA polymorphisms are shown to be associated
Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics

with diseases, because a gain-of-function of an miRNA
polymorphism may recruit or enhance the combination of the miRNA to the targets, thereby strengthen
the regulation effects, such as tumor suppressor genes;
on the contrary, a loss-of-function may result in losing
control of the mRNAs especially those oncogenes and
drug targets (50 ). In the case of miR-146a, a common G/C polymorphism within the pre-miR-146a sequence decreased the generation of pre- and mature
miR-146a and led to less efficient inhibition of target
genes involved in the Toll-like receptor and cytokine
signaling pathway, which contribute to the genetic
predisposition to papillary thyroid carcinoma (51 ).
Recently, Sun and colleagues performed a large-scale
genetic analysis of naturally occurring miRNA polymorphisms and argued that a single base alteration
even outside of the mature miRNA sequence may profoundly impact on miRNA generation and function
(52 ). Additionally, it is by-no-means negligible that
SNPs in target sites of mRNAs may also result in
the escape of inhibition or degradation by an miRNA
(53 ). Taken together, SNP is becoming a noticeable
factor in regulating the biogenesis and functionality
of miRNAs.

The editing pathways of miRNAs
RNA editing is a site-selective modification of RNA
molecules at post-transcriptional level to yield a product differing from the DNA template. Approximately
16% human pri-miRNAs are subject to A-to-I editing (54 ). Known A-to-I editing sites residing in
the mature miRNA sequences are listed in Table
1. miRNA editing may represent a fine tuning process in miRNA biogenesis at different steps, resulting in variations of target mRNAs and providing another layer of regulatory controls within the complex
network of RNA-mediated gene functions (Figure
1). It has recently been shown that, the pri-miRNA
transcripts of some miRNAs are subject to posttranscriptional modification by A-to-I RNA editing,
which is catalyzed by the adenosine deaminases acting
on RNA (ADARs) (55–59 ). As in the case of miR142 and miR-151, A-to-I editing at specific positions
blocks the Drosha/Dicer cleavage in the maturation of
miRNAs (57 , 59 ). Therefore, RNA editing displays
a micro-regulatory role in controlling the miRNAprocessing machinery. In addition, edited miRNAs
may silence a set of genes different from those targeted by the unedited miRNAs, extending the functional scope of miRNAs but increasing the complexity

Increasing reports shed lights on the methylationdependent regulation of miRNA expression. It is described that some miRNA genes are affected by epigenetic inactivation due to aberrant hypermethylation,

sequence (blue) that resides in one of the arms in the stem-loop precursor structure. Editing (highlighted in red dot)
starts at the pri-miRNA stage, and the edited pri-miRNAs may not be processed into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA).
The canonical biogenesis pathway of miRNAs (black arrows; the excised RNA fragments during miRNA biogenesis are

which is characterized as early and frequent events
in cancer development (63–69 ). The expression of
miRNA genes, especially those locating near CpG islands, tends to be affected readily by methylation
(63–65, 70 ) (Figure 2). Han and co-workers found
that the expression of about 10% miRNAs tested

idence that miRNA expression is strictly dominated
by DNA methylation and partial methylation reduction is not sufficient for the recovery of miRNA
expression (71 ). The expression level of miR-370
in human malignant cholangiocytes is significantly
down-regulated by the over-expression of interleukin6 and up-regulated by the methylation inhibitor 5aza-2 -deoxycytidine, indicating that interleukin-6 indirectly activates the expression of miR-370 by alerting the level of DNA methyltransferase enzyme-1 and

HASJ4442 (72 ). Two components of the p53 network,
miR-34b and miR-34c, are also epigenetically silenced
in colorectal cancer due to the hypermethylation of
neighboring CpG islands (73 ). Furthermore, it is conceivable that DNA methylation can affect the expression of transcription factors so that it may control
the miRNA expression in an indirect manner (71 ).
After all, the mechanisms of methylation-dependent
regulation of miRNAs are of great significance and
we are at the very beginning of fully understanding
such mechanisms at molecular details.

Circadian clock-modulated mechanisms
A minority of miRNAs are found to be modulated
in circadian rhythm regulation mechanisms. miR219 is targeted by the CLOCK and BMAL1 complex
(74 ) and miR-132 is induced by photic entrainment
cues through a MAPK/CREB-dependent mechanism
to control clock-related gene expression and to reduce
the entraining effects of light (74 ). Similar regulative
mechanisms were also observed by Xu and colleagues,
where miR-96 and miR-182 are reported to be involved in circadian rhythm regulation by modulating
the expression of adenylyl cyclase VI in retina (75 ).
Yang and colleagues used Drosophila to investigate
circadian clocks that may regulate the expression of
miRNAs and found that a limited number of miRNAs,
such as miR-263a and miR-263b, exhibit robust daily
changes in abundance both in wild type flies and those
reared in complete darkness. The flies behaved in a
model of reaching trough levels during the daytime,
peaking during the night, and their abundances are
constitutively elevated in cyc01 flies (76 ).

(80 ). However, there are still enigmas to be uncovered. miRNAs with incomplete base pairing to their
targets usually repress their actions rather than promote simple degradation. We are yet to know the
fates of these miRNAs, that is, after repressing their
targets, what are the molecular mechanisms to get
rid of these miRNAs? Up to now, a large body of
evidence supports the idea that miRNAs are involved
in a broad spectrum of biological progresses involving
negative post-transcriptional gene regulation. Based
on increasing numbers of specific miRNA functional
study, it is indispensable for us to construct a global
view about miRNA regulation mechanisms and understand miRNA in different angles.

miRNAs modulate the expression of target mRNAs
in different pathways and themselves are also regulated by multiple factors. In-depth analyses have
demonstrated that the repression effect of miRNAs
can be relieved when they are subject to different
types of stress, such as amino acid deprivation, oxidative stress and synaptic stimulation (77–79 ). In
other words, some miRNAs, if not all, may interplay
with their targets in a reversible manner. In addition,
there are clues suggesting that miRNAs may regulate
other non-coding RNAs at post-transcriptional levels,
including their own primary transcripts, and the result supports the possibility that miRNA regulatory
cascades are not limited to protein-coding transcripts
