Abstract
In vitro expanded CNS precursors could provide a renewable
source of dopamine (DA) neurons for cell therapy in Parkinson’s disease. Functional DA neurons have been derived
previously from early midbrain precursors. Here we demonstrate the ability of Nurr1, a nuclear orphan receptor essential
for midbrain DA neuron development in vivo, to induce dopaminergic differentiation in naı̈ve CNS precursors in vitro.
Independent of gestational age or brain region of origin, Nurr1induced precursors expressed dopaminergic markers and
exhibited depolarization-evoked DA release in vitro. However,
these cells were less mature and secreted lower levels of DA

than those derived from mesencephalic precursors. Transplantation of Nurr1-induced DA neuron precursors resulted in
limited survival and in vivo differentiation. No behavioral
improvement in apomorphine-induced rotation scores was
observed. These results demonstrate that Nurr1 induces
dopaminergic features in naı̈ve CNS precursors in vitro.
However, additional factors will be required to achieve in vivo
function and to unravel the full potential of neural precursors
for cell therapy in Parkinson’s disease.

Neural stem cells are deﬁned as a multipotent, self-renewing
cell population able to generate the three major CNS lineages
neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (for review see
McKay 1997). There has been great interest in exploiting the
potential of CNS stem and precursor cells for brain repair.
In vitro generation of dopamine (DA) neurons from CNS
precursors is of particular interest given over 10 years of
clinical experience with fetal tissue transplantation in Parkinson’s disease (Olanow et al. 1996; Freeman et al. 1999;
Piccini et al. 1999). DA is one of the major neurotransmitters
in the CNS and has been implicated in many aspects of brain
function, including motor control (Graybiel et al. 1994),
mood-disorders and addiction (Berke and Hyman 2000) as
well as cognition (Nieoullon 2002). DA neurons are localized
in speciﬁc CNS regions, including the substantia nigra and
ventral tegmental area of the midbrain. The loss of midbrain
nigral DA neurons is the hallmark pathology in Parkinson’s

disease. Recent studies have uncovered a number of genes
involved in midbrain DA neuron development, including the

secreted molecules ﬁbroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and
sonic hedgehog (SHH, Ye et al. 1998), and several transcriptional factors expressed during midbrain DA neurons development such as Ptx3 (Smidt et al. 1997), Lmx1b (Smidt et al.
2000) and Nurr1 (Zetterström et al. 1997).
Nurr1 is a member of the nuclear steroid-thyroid orphan
receptor superfamily. DA neurons fail to develop in Nurr1 null
mutant mice (Zetterström et al. 1997; Castillo et al. 1998;
Saucedo-Cardenas et al. 1998). However, the precise role
of Nurr1 during DA neuron development remains elusive.
The present study demonstrates that Nurr1 is sufﬁcient for
inducing dopaminergic differentiation in CNS precursors
from various developmental stages and regions of origin.
These ﬁndings are in contrast to previous results that
suggested the requirement of a yet undeﬁned factor that acts
in addition to Nurr1 (Wagner et al. 1999) or proposed that
Nurr1 solely enhances the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) without accompanying neural differentiation (Sakurada
et al. 1999). However, this apparent discrepancy could solely
reﬂect differences in the developmental stage or endogenous
growth factor compositions among the various in vitro
culture systems. In the present study, the yield of Nurr1derived DA neurons was markedly increased by exposure to
ascorbic acid (AA) and B27 supplement. Nurr1-derived DA
neurons exhibited spontaneous and potassium-evoked DA
release in vitro but did not lead to restoration of Parkinsonian
symptoms in vivo. These data demonstrate the role of Nurr1
in converting naive CNS precursor cells into functional DA
neurons in vitro as a ﬁrst step towards the development of
CNS precursor based therapies for Parkinson’s disease.

Materials and methods
Primary CNS precursor cultures
All animal experiments were carried out according to NIH
guidelines. Time-pregnant Sprague–Dawley rats were purchased
from Dae Han Biolink (Seoul, Korea). Embryonic CNS tissues were
dissected from embryonic day 12 (day of plug ¼ day 0), 14, 16 rat
cortex, ventral mesencephalon and lateral ganglionic eminence
(LGE; striatal anlage), and mechanically dissociated in Ca2+/Mg2+free Hank’s balanced salt solution (CMF-HBSS; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cells were plated in 6-cm tissue culture
dishes (Corning, NY, USA) pre-coated with ployornithine/ﬁbronectin [ploy-L-ornithine (15 lg/mL, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) at
37C incubator overnight followed by ﬁbronectin (1 lg/mL, Sigma
or Invitrogen) for at least 2 h]. Cells were allowed to proliferate in
the presence of 20 ng/mL basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF; R &
D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) in serum-free medium (N2,
Johe et al. 1996). The bFGF-expanded precursor cells were
passaged by trypsinization and re-plated onto polyornithine/ﬁbronectin pre-coated coverslips (Carolina Biological Supply Company,
Burlington, NC, USA) or 6-cm culture plates for subsequent culture.
Cells were kept proliferating in the presence of bFGF for an
additional 4–6 days to reach 70–90% conﬂuence before inducing

differentiation by withdrawal of the mitogen. In parallel, E12 ventral
midbrain precursors (Studer et al. 1998) were proliferated in the
presence of bFGF and differentiated directly without prior passaging
as a positive control for in vitro DA release and in vivo function.
Except the control E12 cultures, all of the experiments were
performed on passaged cultures as described above, unless noted
otherwise. Cultures were maintained at 37C in 5% CO2 incubator,
media changes were carried out every other day, bFGF was
supplemented daily. In some studies the following factors were
added to the medium: 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen Corporation,
Grand Island, NY, USA), 200 lM ascorbic acid (AA, Sigma),
500 nM all trans-retinoid acid (RA, Sigma), 20 ng/mL brain-derived
neurotrophic factor, 20 ng/mL glial-derived neurotrophic factor,
20 ng/mL neurotrophin-3 (all from R & D systems).
Primary neuronal culture
Cells were mechanically dissociated from E16 rat cortex and plated
at a density of 30 000 cells/cm2 on coverslips pre-coated with
25 lg/mL poly-L-lysine and 10 lg/mL laminin (Invitrogen). Cells
were cultured in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum for 24 h followed by a medium change to serumfree conditions (Neurobasal medium with B27 supplement, 0.5 mM
L-glutamine, and 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 lg/mL streptomycin).
Cultures were maintained at 37C in 5% CO2 incubator for 9 days,
medium changes were carried out every 3 days.
Transfection of Nurr1
An expression vector under the control of the EF1a promoter
(pcDNAEF1a) was constructed by substituting the human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter of the pcDNA3.1 (+)
plasmid (Invitrogen) with the 1.2 kb human EF1a promoter (Gene
bank accession number J04617). pEF1aNurr1, a vector expressing
Nurr1 under the control of the EF1a promoter, was constructed by
engineering Nurr1 cDNA (kindly provided by Drs James Pickel and
Vera Nikodem at NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) into a multicloning site
of the pcDNAEF1a plasmid. The same procedure was applied to
generate a reporter vector pEF1aeGFP expressing eGFP (enhanced
green ﬂuorescent protein; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Neural
precursors expanded in vitro with bFGF for 4 days (60–80%
conﬂuence) were cotransfected with 3 molar pEF1aNurr1 mixed
with 1 molar eGFP vector introduced into the cells using SuperfectR
transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Transfection controls were carried out with the same amount of pcDNAEF1a instead of
pEF1aNurr1 mixed with the eGFP vector. The cells were differentiated by bFGF withdrawal 1 day after transfection and differentiated for an additional 3 days in vitro. The same transfection
experiments were also performed in the cortical precursor cultures
4 days after bFGF withdrawal or cultures for post-mitotic neurons
(see ‘Primary Neuronal Culture’), and transfected cells were
analyzed 3 days after transfection. The transfected cells were
subsequently visualized by direct microscopic examination using a
green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) ﬁlter (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) or by
immunohistochemical detection of the GFP protein.
Retroviral construction and transduction
The full-length Nurr1 cDNA was ampliﬁed with primers 5¢ Xba1
(5¢-AAAATCTAGACCGCCACCATGGATATGCACTGCAAAGC-

AGAC-3¢) and 3¢ BglII (5¢-AAAAGATCTTTAGAAAGGTAAGGTGTCCAGGAAAAGTTTG-3¢) using high ﬁdelity Taq polymerase
(Biotools, Madrid, Spain). The PCR products were digested with
Xba1 and BglII restriction enzymes and cloned into corresponding
sites in MFG retroviral vector by replacing the thymidine kinase
(TK) sequence of MFG.TK.IRES.GFP (Oh et al. 2001). The
retroviral plasmids were introduced into 293gpg retrovirus packaging cell line (Ory et al. 1996) by transient transfection with
Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 72 h, the supernatants were
harvested and used for retroviral infection. In parallel, retroviruses
expressing GFP using MFG.GFP sequence were produced as a
control (mock transduction).
Neural precursors expanded with bFGF in vitro for 4 days were
incubated with the viral supernatant containing polybrene (4 lg/mL)
for 4 h, followed by a medium change. The following day,
precursors were differentiated by bFGF withdrawal and maintained
under differentiation conditions for an additional 2–5 days. For a
clonal analysis experiment, bFGF-expanded precursors (unpassaged) were incubated with the viral supernatant for 2 h as described
above, then the cells were dissociated, harvested and incubated
again with the viral supernatant in a suspension for 2 h, and then
followed by the procedure for clonal analysis.
Clonal analysis
The cells, transduced twice as described above, were plated at 2000–
5000 cells per 10-cm dish and allowed to settle for 2 h. Isolated
single cells were marked on the bottom of the plates with a 3-mm
circle (Nikon) and cells that grew within the marked circles were
referred to as clones. Cells were expanded to form clones for 4 days
with bFGF and then induced to differentiate. Nurr1-transduced
clones were marked again by estimating GFP expression with an
observation on a GFP-ﬁltered microscope 5 days after differentiation (the Nurr1 retroviral vector is designed for GFP to be
expressed using the IRES-GFP sequence in the infected cells; see
‘Retroviral construction and transduction’). At this stage, 30–70% of
the clones expressed GFP. The Nurr1-transduced clones were
cultured two more days and analyzed. The identical experiment was,
in parallel, performed using the cells infected with GFP-expressing
retrovirus as a control.
Immunocytochemistry
Cultured cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde/0.15% picric
acid in phosphate-buffered saline [for c-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) immunostaining, 0.2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma) was
included in the ﬁxative] and were incubated with primary
antibodies overnight at 4C. The following primary antibodies
were used at the concentrations given: Nurr1 polyclonal 1 : 200
(Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA), nestin polyclonal #130 1 : 50
(Martha Marvin and Ron McKay, National Institute of Heath,
Bethesda, MD, USA), TH polyclonal 1 : 250 (Pel-Freez, Rogers,
AR, USA) or monoclonal 1 : 1000 (Sigma), DBH monoclonal
1 : 100 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), GABA polyclonal
1 : 700 (Sigma), b-tubulin type III (TuJ1) monoclonal 1 : 500 or
polyclonal 1: 2000 (both Babco, Richmond, CA, USA), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) monoclonal 1 : 200 (Sigma),
neuronal cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) polyclonal 1 : 1000
(Chemicon), Glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) monoclonal
1 : 400 (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)

polyclonal 1 : 100 (Accurate Chemical & Scientiﬁc corporation,
Westbury, NY, USA) and GFP monoclonal 1 : 400 (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland). For detection of
primary antibodies, ﬂuorescence labeled (FITC or Cy3) secondary
antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove,
PA, USA) were used according to the speciﬁcations of the
manufacturer. Cells and tissue sections were mounted in VECTASHIELDR with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA,
USA) mounting medium for ﬂuorescence and photographed using
a ﬂuorescent microscope (Nikon).
BrdU incorporation
One day after retroviral infection, BrdU (10 lM) was added to
cultures for 1 h just prior to ﬁxation. Anti-BrdU staining was
performed as described above.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
analysis
Total cellular RNA was prepared using TRI REAGENT (Molecular
Research Center, Inc. Cincinnati, OH, USA) according to the
recommendations of the manufacturer. Superscript kit (Invitrogen)
was used for the cDNA synthesis. The PCR reactions were carried
out according to standard protocols. Optimal MgCl2 concentrations
and cycle numbers for linear ampliﬁcation range were determined.
Primer sequences (forward and backward) and product sizes (base
pairs) were as follows: GAPDH (5¢-GGCATTGCTCTCAAT GACAA-3¢, 5¢-AGGGCCTCTCTCTTGCTCTC-3¢, 165); TH (5¢-TGTCAGAGGAGCCCGAGGTC-3¢, 5¢-CCAAGAGCAGCCCATCAAAG-3¢, 300); DAT (5¢-GGACCAATGTTCTTCAGTGGTGGC-3¢,

RT-PCR products were analyzed in an agarose gel containing
ethidium bromide.
Measurement of neurite outgrowth
The basic pattern of neurite outgrowth was analyzed as previously
described (Oh et al. 1996). Brieﬂy, TH+ cells from randomly
selected areas of at least ﬁve cultures from three independent
experiments were photographed. Morphological characteristics were
quantitated using an Axiovert Phase-Contrast Microscope equipped
with an Axiocam digital camera system and Axiovision image
analyzer (Carl Zeiss, Zena, Germany). Clusters of cells were

excluded from the morphometric analysis. The length of primary
neurite was deﬁned as the distance from the soma to the tip of the
longest branch. The total extent of neurite was deﬁned as the
combined lengths of all neurites per cell. The number of neurites per
cell was identiﬁed as all processes longer than two cell diameters in
length.
DA determination by reverse-phase HPLC
DA releases were determined in the cultures for precursors after
5 days of differentiation in conditioned medium (48 h after last
medium change), in HBSS (15 min, basal release), and in HBSS
plus 56 mM KCl (15 min, evoked release). DA in the medium was
immediately stabilized with orthophosphoric acid (7.5%)/metabisulfate (0.22 mg/mL) and stored at )80C until analysis (Studer
et al. 1996). After centrifugation at 1500 g through centrifugal ﬁlter
devices (Microcon YM-10, Millipore Co., MA, USA) to eliminate
proteins and other macromolecular constituents from the sample,
DA was extracted by aluminum adsorption and eluted in 0.1 M
perchloric acid. The DA was separated by reverse phase l-Bondapak C18 column (300 · 3.9 mm, Waters, Cotland, NY, USA) that
was maintained at 32C with a column heater (Waters). The mobile
phase consisted of 0.05 M citric acid, 0.05 M disodium phosphate
(pH 3.1), 3.2 mM 1-octanesulfonic acid (sodium salt), 0.3 mM
EDTA and 12% methanol, and was pumped at a ﬂow rate of
0.5 mL/min using a solvent delivery system (Waters). Samples
(20 lL) were injected with a Rheodyne injector and the compounds
were analyzed using a coulometric detector (ESA, Bedford, MA,
USA) with an analytical cell (Model 5014B, ESA). The potential for
the ﬁrst and second cell was set at +10 mV and +320 mV,
respectively. A guard cell (ESA, potential +450 mV) was placed
before the injector. The concentrations of DA detected in the
supernatants were determined by comparison with a standard
solution of DA injected into the column immediately before and
after each experiment.

In vivo studies
Male Sprague–Dawley rats, weighing 220–250 g at the start of the
experiment, were used for all the in vivo study. Under pentobarbital
anesthesia, 4 lL of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 3 lg/lL in
normal saline containing 0.2 mg/mL AA) was injected stereotaxically into the substantia nigra and the median forebrain bundle (4.8
and 1.8 mm posterior to bregma; 1.5 and 1.8 mm lateral to midline;
8.2 and 8.0 mm ventral to the dura). The incisor bar was set at
3.5 mm below zero (interaural line).
Three weeks after the 6-OHDA lesioning animals were tested for
apomorphine-induced turning behavior (apomorphine at 0.2 mg/kg
i.p. in saline containing 2 mg/mL AA). The rats were tested over a
30 min interval and animals with net rotational asymmetry of at
least 10 full turns per minute away from the lesioned side were
selected for transplantation surgery. The apomorphine-induced
rotation was evaluated at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks after
transplantation.
At 2 days after differentiation, the cells were dissociated by
trypsinization and suspended in normal saline. Animals were
anesthetized with pentobarbital and placed in a stereotaxic frame.
Using an 18-gauge needle, 3 lL of the cell suspensions
(1 · 105 cells/lL) were injected over a 5 min period in the lesioned
striatum at each of the three sites (0.2, 0.2, 1.2 mm anterior to

bregma; 3.0, 3.0, 2.5 mm lateral to midline; 5.5, 4.0, 4.7 mm ventral
to the dura, setting the incisor bar at 3.5 mm below interaural zero).
The needle was left in place for 3 min following the completion of
each injection. The rats received daily injections of cyclosporine A
(10 mg/kg, i.p.) starting 1 day before grafting and continuing for
20 days.
Six weeks after transplantation, animals were anesthetized
(50 mg/kg phenobarbital) and intracardially perfused with 4%
paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Brains were
removed and immersed in 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered
saline overnight and sliced on a freezing microtome (CM 1850,
Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Free-ﬂoating brain sections (40 lm
thick) were subjected to TH-immunohistochemistry as described
above and image was captured using a confocal microscope
(LSM510, Zeiss, Feldbach, Switzerland).
Cell counting and statistical analysis
Immunoreactive or DAPI-stained cells were counted in 5–10
uniform randomly chosen areas of each well using an eye piece
grid at a ﬁnal magniﬁcation of 200 or 400. Three to six-culture wells
were analyzed in each experiment. Data are expressed as mean ±
SEM. Statistical comparisons were made by ANOVA with Tukey
post hoc analysis (SPSS 11.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) when
more than two groups were involved.

Results

Nurr1 transfection induced TH expression in cortical
CNS precursors
Neural precursors were expanded and passaged in serum-free
medium in the presence of bFGF (see ‘Material and
methods’). After bFGF-proliferation for additional 4–6 days,
over 95% of cells was immunoreactive for the intermediate
ﬁlament nestin, a marker of neural precursor cells. Less than
3% of the cells expressed neuronal (TuJ1) or astroglial
(GFAP) markers. None of the nestin + cells was positive for
TuJ1 and less than 0.5% coexpressed GFAP. The similar
proportions of these immunoreactive cells were observed in
the passaged cultures for neural precursors regardless of
embryonic ages (E12–E16) and regions of origin [cortex,
midbrain, LGE] from which neural precursors were isolated.
These ﬁndings demonstrate the selectiveness of the culture
conditions for neural precursors.
To examine the role of Nurr1 in DA differentiation, bFGF
expanded and passaged E14 cortical precursors were transfected with constitutively expressed Nurr1 (pEF1a-Nurr1).
Co-transfection with an eGFP-expressing vector was used to
identify Nurr1-overexpressing cells. One day after transfection, precursors were differentiated by bFGF withdrawal and
differentiation for another 3 days. Very few (< 0.01%) TH+
cells were detected in control precursor cultures transfected
with eGFP only. Nurr1 transfection caused a dramatic
increase in the number of TH+ cells (Fig. 1). Almost all
TH imunoreactivity was detected exclusively in the trans-

Fig. 1 Nurr1-induced TH expression in the cultures for E14 cortical
precursors. Cortical precursors were cotransfected with a Nurr1(pEF1aNurr1) and a GFP-expressing vector (pEF1aeGFP) and the
transfected cells were visualized by immunostaining against GFP
protein. The differentiation of the transfected precursors was induced
by withdrawal of bFGF at the following day of transfection. Three days
after differentiation, double immunocytochemical analyses for TH (b)
and GFP (a) were performed in the transfected cultures. TH+/GFP+
cells are yellow in the merged image of TH and GFP immunostaining
(c). TH immunoreactivities (TH+/GFP+, yellow in c) were detected in
the Nurr1 transfected cells, whereas no TH cell was shown in the
cultures transfected with the control vector (pcDNAEF1a, data not
shown). Scale bar, 20 lm.

fected (GFP+) cells and no TH imunoreactivity was observed
in untransfected cells. This suggests that cell autonomous
expression of Nurr1 is required for TH induction in these
precursors. The percentage of GFP+ cells expressing TH was
15 ± 2.5% in Nurr1 transfected cultures vs. 0% in control
cultures (n ¼ 10). TH+ cells did not coexpress dopamine
b-hydroxylase, a marker of noradrenergic or adrenergic
neurons (data not shown), conﬁrming their dopaminergic
identity. Four days after bFGF withdrawal, over 70% of cells
were positive to TuJ1 or GFAP. Nurr1 transfection into the
cell differentiated for 4 days did not induce TH expression.
Similarly, Nurr1 was unable to induce TH+ cell in primary
neuronal cultures containing > 90% post-mitotic neurons.
These ﬁndings indicate that the DA-inducing effect of Nurr1
speciﬁcally occurs during precursor proliferation but not in
differentiated neurons or astrocytes.
Efficient generation of TH+ cells by retroviral Nurr1
transduction in combination with AA and B27 treatment
Due to the low transfection efﬁciency using liposomemediated gene transfer (< 0.5% of total cells), a Nurr1
retroviral expression vector was generated to efﬁciently
transduce proliferating E14 cortical precursor cells. Upon
2 days of retroviral infection, 44.9 ± 1.6% of total cells
(n ¼ 30) were immunoreactive for Nurr1 in transduced
cultures, whereas no Nurr1 + cells were detected in untransduced control cultures. Retroviral gene transfer led to the
efﬁcient generation of TH+ cells (Fig. 2a). One day after
infection, 1.5% of the cells were TH+ (the day immediately
before bFGF-withdrawal). The number of TH+ cells gradually increased up to 5 days after bFGF-withdrawal (8.1%,
n ¼ 30) and was maintained for at least up to 10 days of
differentiation. Whereas the effect of AA on dopaminergic

differentiation has been demonstrated previously (Yan et al.
2001; Lee et al. 2003), exposure to B27 supplement also
increased DA neuron differentiation in midbrain precursors
(data not shown). Here we tested whether AA and B27 might
further enhance DA neuron differentiation in Nurr1-induced
cortical precursors. Supplementation of the medium with
either AA or B27 led to a dramatic increase in TH+ cells and
the addition of both factors showed an additive effect
(Fig. 2a). Exposure to AA and B27 during culture period
after Nurr1 transduction increased the number of TH+ cells
derived from Nurr1-transduced cortical precursors from 8.1%
(see above) to 23.3 ± 1.0 and 31.5 ± 1.7% TH+ cells,
respectively, 5 days after differentiation (6 days after infection). Combined treatment with AA and B27 resulted in
37.5 ± 1.1% TH+ cells out of the total cells population
(n ¼ 40 for all values, p < 0.01 for combined treatment vs.
AA and p < 0.05 for combined treatment vs. B27). On the
other hand, either AA or B27 by itself did not elicit any effect
of increasing TH+ cells in untransduced cultures (Fig. 2a),
although both AA and B27, as described above, have the
effect in the cultures for midbrain precursors from which a
certain proportion of TH+ cells are normally generated (Yan
et al. 2001). These data suggest that AA and B27 act in an
additive fashion on the Nurr1-induced generation of TH+
cells. Conversely, differentiation into GABAergic neurons
was signiﬁcantly decreased in Nurr1-transduced cultures
(9.0 ± 2.9% in Nurr1 transduced vs. 31.7 ± 3.9% in control
cultures (both supplemented with AA and B27; n ¼ 40,
p < 0.01) (Fig. 2b).
The yield of Nurr1-induced TH+ cells was not increased
by other known neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived
neurotrophic factor, glial-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, or exposure to RA.
The Nurr1-mediated induction of TH+ cells were not
limited to the precursors derived from the E14 cortex. Neural
precursors isolated from E12–E16 as well as precursors from
other regions such as the midbrain or LGE displayed similar
responses (Table 1).
Nurr1-induced TH+ cells adopt DA neuronal fate
upon differentiation
Similar to the transfection results, all TH+ cells colocalized
Nurr1 (Fig. 3e), and 79.1 ± 3.8% of all Nurr1+ cells were
TH+ 5 days after differentiation (n ¼ 25). Nurr1-induced
TH+ cells exhibited two distinct morphologies: (i) TH+
cells typically arranged in clusters displaying immature
precursor morphologies (Fig. 3b, and arrow in Fig. 3a) and

precursors undergoing neuronal but not astrocytic differentiation.
RT-PCR analyses demonstrated Nurr1-induced expressions of genes involved in DA synthesis and transport
including TH, L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase
(AADC), DA transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine
transporter (VMAT), as well as the midbrain DA neuron
marker (Ptx-3) without affecting c-ret, a gene reported to be
Nurr1-dependent (Wallen et al. 2001). No Nurr1-dependent
changes were observed in the expression of genes controlling
early midbrain development such as SHH, Smoothened
(Smo), FGF8, FGF receptor 3 (FGFR-3), Engrailed-1 (En1),
Pax2, and Pax5 (Fig. 4b). Expression pattern of Nurr1transduced E14 midbrain cells was not different from that of
cortical cells.
DA release in Nurr1-induced TH+ neurons
Synaptic release of the neurotransmitter DA is a deﬁnitive
measure for the identiﬁcation of DA neurons. We evaluated
the DA releases from E14 cortical and E14 midbrain
precursors transduced with Nurr1. Cells were differentiated
for 5 days, and conditioned medium (48 h after last medium
change) was collected and tested by HPLC. DA was readily
detected in the conditioned medium prepared from Nurr1transduced cultures (808.9 ± 61.3, n ¼ 5 and 1336.9 ± 82.4,
n ¼ 6, pg/106 TH+ cells of DA in E14 cortical and midbrain
cultures, respectively). Basal DA release (15 min HBSS)

yielded 334.9 ± 50.5, 253.0 ± 17.4 pg/106 TH+ cells in
cortical and midbrain-derived precursors, respectively. KClevoked release (15 min 56 mM KCl) was 1709.1 ± 117.9 and
1947.3 ± 136.3 pg/106 TH+ cells (p < 0.05, paired t-test,
comparing evoked to basal release). No norephinephrine
and epinephrine release could be detected. These data
provide in vitro functional evidence of Nurr1-induced DA
neuron identity.
Morphological differentiation of Nurr1-induced
TH+ neurons
Nurr1-induced DA neurons exhibit less mature morphologies than DA neurons derived from E12 midbrain precursors (Fig. 5c), though a small subset of Nurr1-DA displays
highly elaborated morphologies (Figs 3c and d). Morphometric analyses compared length and number of dendrites
5 days after differentiation. As shown in Table 2, number
of neurites, length of the primary neurite, and total neuritic
extent were signiﬁcantly increased in E12-DA neurons
compared with those in Nurr1-DA cells. Consistent with
these morphological observations, E12 precursor-derived
DA neurons secreted 10–20 folds more DA than Nurr1induced DA neurons (Fig. 5b). DA levels in the E12
precursor-derived TH+ cells were 17.0 ± 2.3, 5.4 ± 3.4,
and 19.1 ± 5.3 ng/106 TH+ cells in conditioned medium,
basal and evoked release, respectively (n ¼ 5 for all
values).

overexpression. *Positive control, cDNA isolated from E14.5 midbrain

Effect of Nurr1 on neuronal and astrocytic differentiation
of cortical precursors
Nurr1-overexpression did not affect the proliferation rate in
neural precursors or the ratio of astrocytic vs. neuronal
progeny upon cell differentiation. BrdU incorporation studies
during bFGF proliferation (1 h BrdU exposure immediately
prior to ﬁxation) yielded 29.2 ± 1.7% and 29.8 ± 1.9% in S
phase for Nurr1-transduced and control cultures, respectively
(n ¼ 20 each). The percentages of TuJ1+ cells in cortical
precursors 5 days after bFGF withdrawal were 43.9 ± 2.7%
in Nurr1-transduced cultures vs. 45.3 ± 4.3% in GFPtransduced control cultures. GFAP percentages were
36.6 ± 2.8 and 41.1 ± 2.2 in Nurr1 transduced and control
cultures, respectively (n ¼ 20 each).
Clonal analysis was performed to study the effect of Nurr1
on single cortical precursors (see ‘Experimental methods’).

GFAP+ cells. These clones contained precursors only
(undifferentiated clones: 21.5 ± 6.5% of all clones in
Nurr1-transduced vs. 20.4 ± 6.1% in GFP-transduced
group). The proportions of the clones producing neuron
and astrocyte (dipotent), neuron-only and astrocyte-only in
the Nurr1-transduced cultures were not signiﬁcantly different
from the GFP-transduced control cultures: 35.2 ± 7.6% vs.
42.8 ± 6.3% (dipotent clone), 37.2 ± 6.9% vs. 30.6 ± 2.8%
(neuron-only clone), and 5.8 ± 1.4% vs. 6.1 ± 1.1% (astrocyte-only clone) in Nurr1-transduced vs. GFP-transduced
control cultures, respectively (n ¼ 4 for each value; 61 Nurr1
clones and 59 control clones were analyzed from four
independent experiments). Absolute numbers of neurons and
astrocytes also did not differ between Nurr1 and control
clones (data not shown). These ﬁndings, collectively, suggest
that Nurr1 overexpression does not interfere with proliferation or neuronal and astrocytic differentiation of neural
precursors.
TH expression in differentiated clones conﬁrmed our
results with non-clonal cultures. TH+ cells were detected in
72.9 ± 3.6% (n ¼ 3) of the Nurr1-clones and 37.3 ± 10.6%
(n ¼ 22 from three independent experiments) of the cells in
the TH-producing clones were positive to TH. This result
demonstrates that single cortical precursor cells can give rise
to TH+ cells after Nurr1 transduction without the need for
any extrinsic midbrain derived cofactors as proposed previously (Wagner et al. 1999).
Apomorphine-induced rotational behavior
Cells derived from Nurr1-transduced E14 cortical and E14
midbrain precursors were grafted into the ipsilateral striatum
of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. A previous study has shown the
effective reduction of amphetamine-induced rotation scores
in the animals grafted with precursors isolated from E12
rat midbrain (Studer et al. 1998). In accordance with this
previous work, transplantation of unpassaged E12 midbrain
precursors (2 days after differentiation) led to reduced
rotation scores 6 weeks after transplantation [out of seven
animals grafted, three showed a marked (> 80%) and two
animals a slight (> 30%) reduction]. The average percentage
decrease in rotation scores as compared to pre-transplantation
values were 7.0 ± 8.4, 17.2 ± 10.7, 25.0 ± 10.2, 27.8 ± 14.0,
34.3 ± 13.7 and 47.4 ± 13.8% after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 weeks

of transplantation (n ¼ 7). However, no reduction of
apomorphine-induced rotation scores was observed in animals grafted with Nurr1-transduced cortical or midbrain
precursors (n ¼ 8 for the cortical and n ¼ 7 for midbrain
precursors) (Fig. 6a). Consistent with poor behavioral
results, histology 6 weeks after transplantation revealed
fewer surviving TH+ cells in the Nurr1-transduced group,
compared with E12 precursor-grafted group: 2422.5 ± 212.7
(Nurr1-transduced E14 cortical precursors) and 3120.0 ±
196.9 (Nurr1-transduced E14 midbrain precursors) vs.
8895.0 ± 365.1 in the E12-precursor group, n ¼ 3 for all
values, corresponding to about 4, 5 and 18% of TH+ cell
survival rates of total TH+ cells grafted, respectively.
Furthermore, TH+ cells in the grafts with E12 midbrain
precursors appeared much more differentiated with numerous
long processes extending into the host striatum (iii and vi in
Fig. 6b), whereas TH cells in the Nurr-1 transduced groups
exhibited immature neuronal morphologies (i, iv and ii, v in
Fig. 6b).
Discussion

The efﬁcient in vitro generation of DA neurons from CNS
precursors is of great interest due to the great clinical need for
a renewable cell source in experimental transplantation
studies in Parkinson’s disease. Several studies have attempted
DA neuron conversion of neural stem and precursor cells via
overexpression of Nurr1. Nurr1-overexpression alone was
insufﬁcient to activate TH expression in C17.2 neural stem
cell lines established from the mouse cerebellum, but soluble
factors secreted by type I astrocytes were required in addition
to Nurr1 (Wagner et al. 1999). This study was in contrast to
work by Gage and colleagues who reported that Nurr1 readily
induces TH expression in undifferentiated adult hippocampal
precursor cells but cannot induce them to differentiate into
DA neurons (Sakurada et al. 1999). The present study
demonstrates that Nurr1-overexpression sufﬁces for the
generation of functional DA neurons from CNS precursor
cells. These ﬁndings are related to the cell source of origin. In
contrast to both previous studies we used short-term expanded primary CNS precursor cells that may have a distinct
potential for that of established cell lines (Wagner et al. 1999)
or long-term expanded adult neural precursors (Sakurada

et al. 1999). Similar to our study, it was recently demonstrated that Nurr1 constitutively expressed in mouse embryonic
stem cells facilitates embryonic stem cells to differentiate into
DA neurons (Chung et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2002).
DA neurons from Nurr1-induced CNS precursor showed a
much less mature neuronal phenotype as those from E12
mesencephalic precursors (Fig. 5c). Midbrain DA neuron
commitment is thought to occur early in brain development
(between E9–E11 in the rat) (Wang et al. 1995; Hynes et al.
1995a,b, 1997) whereas TH expression is acquired much
later upon terminal differentiation (Saucedo-Cardenas et al.
1998; Witta et al. 2000). Thus, most of the DA neurons
generated from cultured E12 neural precursors are likely to
be derived from their progenitors, having already acquired a
certain level of neuronal and dopaminergic commitment but
retaining their ability to proliferate at least short term. The
precursor status of the cells appears crucial as our transfection of Nurr1 into differentiated cells did not show any
increase in TH+. This result is consistent with previous
ﬁndings reporting a correlation between proliferation rate and
Nurr1-mediated DA neuron conversion in C17.2 cells
(Wagner et al. 1999). In addition, TH+ cells could be
detected even in the presence of bFGF in Nurr1-transduced

culture, whereas TH+ in E12 midbrain precursor cultures
generally appear only after bFGF withdrawal. In fact some of
the Nurr1-transduced TH+ cells incorporated BrdU suggesting sustained precursor status (data not shown). These
ﬁndings indicate that Nurr1 acts on undifferentiated precursor cells, and that Nurr1-induced TH expression preceded
terminal differentiation into neurons. Thus, the sequence of
DA neuron differentiation by exogenous Nurr1 in vitro
seems to be reversed to that of in vivo midbrain DA neuron
differentiation where TH expression occurs several days after
the expression of neuronal markers. The reason for this
inversion is unclear. One possible explanation could be that
bFGF causes a delayed neuronal differentiation and Nurr1 is
able to overcome delayed TH expression but not the delayed
expression of neuronal markers. Another possibility is that
the dose of Nurr1 is critical and that superphysiological
levels cause premature TH induction.
However, the mechanism by which Nurr1 promotes DA
neuron differentiation remains elusive. Previous work demonstrated that Nurr1 null mutant mice undergo normal
midbrain formation, patterning and neuronal differentiation
including the establishment of normal projections to the
striatum. However, these mesencephalic precursors are

unable to express markers of DA neuron phenotype such as
TH (Witta et al. 2000). Direct transcriptional activation via
binding to the TH promoter has been proposed as a
mechanism of Nurr1 action in adult hippocampal precursor
cells (Sakurada et al. 1999; Iwawaki et al. 2000). In contrast,
Nurr1 overexpression in DA MN9D cells resulted in mature
and highly differentiated phenotypes with long neurites
(Castro et al. 2001). Here, we found no effect of Nurr1 on
precursor cell proliferation or neuronal vs. glial differentiation, and Nurr1-induced TH+ cells often displayed very
immature morphologies (Fig. 5c). Candidate developmental
genes crucial for early midbrain DA neuron development
were unchanged, whereas DA neuron markers such as TH,
AADC, DAT, VMAT and Ptx3 were increased. Our results
support the hypothesis that Nurr1 induces the biochemical
machinery of DA neurons independent of appropriate
regional patterning state of the cells and without true
re-speciﬁcation of neuronal subtype.
Our data did not yield any functional improvements in
Parkinsonian rats grafted with Nurr1-DA cells (Fig. 6).
Behavioral improvement is typically correlated to the number
of surviving DA neurons. However, the minimum number of
surviving DA neurons for inducing behavioral improvement
in rodents is approximately 100–200 (Galpern et al. 1996).
This suggests that the number of surviving TH+ cells in
Nurr1-DA grafted animals is unlikely to account for the lack
of behavioral improvement. DA release from grafted neurons
is another essential parameter (Rioux et al. 1991). Even
though we detected signiﬁcant DA release of Nurr1-DA
neurons in vitro, we cannot rule out that these cells exhibit
decreased DA release in vivo or lack sufﬁcient synaptic
interaction with the host brain, another important parameter
for long-term graft function (Zuddas et al. 1991; Bjorklund
1993; Bjorklund and Lindvall 2000; Isacoson et al. 2001).
The immature morphologies of Nurr1-DA cells (Fig. 5 and
Table 2) suggest that insufﬁcient differentiation and maturation might be key factors for the negative in vivo results.
Future studies involving DA measurements in vivo should
address this issue. Survival and function of donor cells is also
highly dependent on trophic support (Rosenblad et al. 1996;
Zawada et al. 1998) and can be adversely affected by
immunologic factors (Larsson et al. 2000). Nurr1-DA cells
exhibited reduced in vivo survival and maturation, compared
with E12 precursor-derived DA cells. Further studies should
address whether inﬂammatory host responses or speciﬁc
growth factor requirements of Nurr1-DA cells may be
responsible for the lack of in vivo function.
Although neural stem cells are thought to provide a
renewable source of speciﬁc neurons, the challenges remain
to overcome limitations in long-term propagation and
difﬁculties in specifying neuronal subtypes. The in vitro
generation of rat DA neurons with successful in vivo grafting
data is currently still limited to cells isolated from E11.5E12.5 ventral midbrain (Studer et al. 1998; Lee et al. 2003).

Moreover, the efﬁciency of DA neuron generation from
mesencephalic precursors steeply decreases after long-term
expansion and passaging (Yan et al. 2001). The present study
provides a potential strategy on how these limits could be
overcome. The forced expression of Nurr1 leads to the
efﬁcient generation of DA-producing TH+ neurons from
passaged CNS precursors regardless of embryonic stages and
brain regions of origin from which precursors were isolated.
Future studies will need to address the limited in vitro and
in vivo maturation and DA neuron function of Nurr1-induced
CNS precursors to make these cells a valid alternative to the
use of midbrain precursors or primary fetal tissue. However,
this study provides a ﬁrst step towards a renewable CNS
precursor-based generic source of DA neurons for cell
therapy in Parkinson’s disease.
