MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate cellular fate by controlling the stability or translation of mRNA transcripts. Although the spatial and
temporal patterning of miRNA expression is tightly controlled,
little is known about signals that induce their expression nor
mechanisms of their transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, few
miRNA targets have been validated experimentally. The miRNA,
miR132, was identified through a genome-wide screen as a target
of the transcription factor, cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB). miR132 is enriched in neurons and, like many neuronal
CREB targets, is highly induced by neurotrophins. Expression of
miR132 in cortical neurons induced neurite outgrowth. Conversely,
inhibition of miR132 function attenuated neuronal outgrowth. We
provide evidence that miR132 regulates neuronal morphogenesis
by decreasing levels of the GTPase-activating protein, p250GAP.
These data reveal that a CREB-regulated miRNA regulates neuronal
morphogenesis by responding to extrinsic trophic cues.

ormones, growth factors, and electrical activity regulate proliferation, differentiation, survival, and plasticity by triggering
programs of gene expression. Although many transcription factors
respond to environmental cues, the basic leucine zipper transcription factor, cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), is
considered prototypical because it was among the first identified, is
expressed widely, and regulates many rapid-response genes (1).
Phosphorylation of a conserved residue in its activation domain is
required for CREB function (2). Although CREB was identified by
virtue of its responsiveness to cAMP signaling, it is activated by an
array of other cellular signals, including, but not limited to, neurotrophic factors, cytokines, and neuronal activity. The ability of
CREB to recruit the coactivator, CREB binding protein (CBP) (3),
in a phosphorylation-dependent manner underlies its capacity to
mediate stimulus-induced transcription. CBP recruitment is believed to trigger transcriptional activation via intrinsic or associated
acetylase activities and兾or by interacting with general transcription
factors (4). Recently, signal-dependent nuclear translocation of the
coactivator transducer of regulated CREB has also been implicated
in CREB activation (5).
The role of CREB in cellular adaptive responses has been studied
most extensively in the nervous system. Early experiments revealed
that stimuli known to effect neuronal maturation and plasticity,
including cAMP signaling, membrane depolarization, and neurotrophins, were robust activators of CREB-dependent gene expression. These observations inspired other studies suggesting that
CREB is a central regulator of memory formation and other forms
of behavioral adaptation believed to require programs of de novo
gene expression (6). Subsequent studies supported a role for CREB
as a key regulator of developmental plasticity, addiction, and
circadian rhythmicity (1).
A prominent role for CREB in neuronal survival has hampered
analysis of its actions in regulating neuronal maturation and function. Nevertheless, a recent study provided strong evidence that
CREB mediates neurotrophin-dependent morphogenesis of peripheral neurons (7). Additional studies have suggested a role for

CREB in CNS morphogenesis (8, 9). The set of genes that directly
mediate these effects has not been defined, however. To gain insight
into the molecular mechanisms underlying CREB-regulated plasticity, we developed a genome-wide screen, termed Serial Analysis
of Chromatin Occupancy that can profile transcription factor
binding sites in an unbiased manner (10). This screen identified
hundreds of CREB-binding sites that are tightly associated with
noncoding transcripts and microRNAs (miRNAs) (S.I. and R.H.G.,
unpublished data). In this study, we characterize one of these
unique transcripts.
miRNAs were first described in Caenorhabditis elegans (11, 12).
Subsequent work demonstrated that these molecules encode 19- to
24-bp double-stranded RNAs that mediate gene silencing (13–15).
miRNAs have since been identified in vertebrates and have been
proposed to regulate a significant fraction of cellular mRNAs.
miRNAs regulate a diverse set of biological functions, including
regulation of developmental timing and neuronal asymmetry in C.
elegans (11, 12, 16, 17); cell proliferation, suppression of apoptosis
(18), and fat metabolism (19) in Drosophila; and hematopoetic and
adipocyte differentiation (20, 21), insulin secretion (22), cardiomyocyte development (23), oncogenesis (24–27), and viral defense in
mammals (28–30). Mature miRNAs silence gene expression by
binding to the 3⬘UTRs of target mRNAs and promote translational
repression or mRNA degradation (31).
Significant strides have been made in deciphering the stepwise
processing of miRNAs from their larger precursors (32). The
relatively few primary transcripts thus far studied suggest that
miRNAs are derived from spliced coding or noncoding transcripts
(33–35). Because many miRNA genes are near complex transcriptional loci, the regulatory elements responsible for miRNA biogenesis have been difficult to determine. Most studies indicate that
miRNAs are derived from polyadenylated RNA polymerase II
transcripts, but polymerase III-dependent mechanisms have also
been suggested (36).
By analogy with protein-coding genes, identification of the
pathways that control miRNA transcription should provide insight
into the biological functions of these molecules. We focused on
miRNA 132 (miR132) because it was tightly associated with a
CREB-binding site and was highly responsive to neurotrophin
signaling, suggesting a role in neuronal differentiation. Overexpression of this miRNA in cortical neurons dramatically increased the
sprouting of neuronal processes. Conversely, inactivation of this
miRNA reversed this process. We used bioinformatic databases to
identify putative targets of miR132 and found that a highly conConflict of interest statement: No conflicts declared.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Stimulation. PC12 cells and neonatal rat cortical
neurons were cultured as described (37). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; Chemicon) was dissolved in dH2O and used at
50 ng兾ml (final concentration).
Plasmids. The premiR1-1 and premiR132 hairpins were amplified

from rat genomic DNA by using the following primers: miR1-1
forward, TGGCGAGAGAGTTCCTAGCCTG; miR1-1 reverse,
GTGTGCACAACTTCAGCCCATA; miR132 forward, CTAGCCCCG CAGACACTAGC; miR132 reverse, CCCCGCCTCCTCTTGCTCTGTA. premiR1-1, premiR132, GFP, LacZ, and

were used overnight at 4°C in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1%
Triton X-100, 10 mM NaF, and 5% BSA: polyclonal anti-p250GAP
(1:1,000) (39), monoclonal anti-GFP (Clontech), polyclonal antiCBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, A22), and polyclonal anti-LacZ
(5⬘ 3⬘). Then, 1–2 ⫻ 106 neonatal day 5 rat cortical neurons were
subjected to chromatin immunoprecipitation as described (10).
Immunocytochemistry and Quantitation of Neuronal Morphology.

Cortical neurons were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4,
with 75 mM Hepes for 5 min. Neurons were blocked (1–2 h at 22°C)
in 5% BSA in PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100 and 10 mM NaF. The
rabbit anti-p250 Ab was used at 1:1,000, and anti-MAP2 mAb

Alexa 594 anti-rabbit IgG or 1 ␮g兾ml Alexa 488 anti-mouse IgG
(Molecular Probes). Neurites from GFP fluorescent neurons were
traced and quantified by using the NEURONJ program (50) that
allows semiautomatic tracings of neurites. Neurites were traced and
quantified in a blinded manner.
Northern Blotting. RNA was purified by using the mirVana miRNA

served putative target, p250 GTPase-activating protein (GAP), had
previously been linked to neuronal differentiation. We confirmed
that p250GAP protein levels were controlled by miR132 in cortical
neurons and showed that the ability of miR132 to regulate neuronal
morphogenesis depends, at least in part, on its ability to target
p250GAP.

CREB Regulates miR132 Transcription. The CREB Serial Analysis of

Chromatin Occupancy screen identified 13 genomic signature tags
that fell in the vicinity of the miR212兾132 locus (Fig. 1A). The
largest cluster of genomic signature tags was located within the
miR132 transcript. Two consensus CREs (TGACGTCA) are located immediately 5⬘ to the predicted miR212 transcript and
another is located closer to miR132. The entire miR212兾132 locus
falls within a CpG island. CREB binding was confirmed at the
consensus CRE sequences but not within a region between the two
miRNAs (Fig. 1B), and these results were confirmed by using in vivo
DNase I footprinting assays (Fig. 1C). Because miR212 has not yet
been experimentally verified, we focused our analysis on miR132.
To characterize its expression, we used real-time RT-PCR analysis
of RNAs isolated from selected brain regions. These studies showed
that premiR132 is enriched in hippocampus, cortex, and brainstem
(Fig. 1D).
Response of the miR132 Gene Is Rapid and Long-Lasting. CREB has

been shown to mediate rapid responses to stimuli, such as
neurotrophins, by inducing the expression of immediate early
genes. We used real-time RT-PCR to determine whether CREB
similarly regulated miR132 transcription. BDNF markedly increased the expression of the miR132 precursor (Fig. 2A).
Cotransfection of ACREB, a mutant that inhibits DNA binding
of endogenous CREB (42), reduced miR132 transcription in
response to BDNF. ACREB expression had no effect on BDNFstimulated transcription of an NF␬B-responsive reporter gene

canonical mRNAs that ultimately are transported to the cytoplasm. In an effort to clone the miR132 primary transcript, we
examined rat mRNA and EST annotation surrounding miR132
and found only a few low-confidence unspliced transcripts. Using
RT-PCR, we mapped the 5⬘-splice site of a unique transcript
whose first exon was located upstream of miR212 and whose
second exon began downstream of miR132 (Fig. 3A). 5⬘ captrapping RACE and 3⬘ RACE produced single products that
confirmed a two exon transcript without a significant ORF. We
next determined whether the parent transcript was activated by
neurotrophins. Real-time RT-PCR revealed neurotrophininduced transcription only in areas that overlapped the cloned
rat cDNA (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, the exonic sequences were
present at ⬇40-fold lower levels than the products of the intron

the biologically important transcript. These results are reminisVo et al.

Expression of miR132 Promotes Neurite Outgrowth. CREB is widely

believed to regulate axonal and dendritic development. Genetic
rescue experiments suggest that CREB is a critical regulator of
NGF-induced axonal outgrowth in peripheral neurons (7). Likewise, attenuation of CREB function inhibits cAMP- and neurotrophin-induced neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons (8, 9). Because miR132 is enriched in brain tissue, we investigated whether
miR132 might contribute to neuronal morphogenesis. Overexpression of the miR132 precursor in primary cortical neurons induced
a marked increase in primary neurite outgrowth in comparison to
cells transfected with GFP alone (Fig. 4 A and B). Northern blot
analysis confirmed that expression of the miR132 precursor was
associated with expression of the 22-bp mature miRNA (data not
shown). This phenotype is specific for miR132, as overexpression of
miR1-1, a heart- specific miRNA, does not effect neurite outgrowth. The average total neurite length for miR132-transfected
neurons was 42% greater than that of miR1-1 transfected controls
(Fig. 4B). Furthermore, transfection of an antisense 2⬘O-methyl
RNA, but not a sense control, attenuated neurite outgrowth (Fig.

number of primary neurites and the average total neurite length
(Fig. 5B).
miR132 Targets p250GAP. Because miRNAs generally inhibit expression of their target mRNAs, we hypothesized that the target of
miR132 encodes a protein that represses neurite outgrowth. Analysis of miR132 (through the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics web
site) reveals a high degree of conservation amongst vertebrates,
suggesting that its targets may be similarly conserved. To predict
possible miR132 targets, we used the MIRANDA prediction algorithm (52) and looked for evolutionary conservation of the target
3⬘UTRs in neuronally expressed genes (45). Although many predicted targets for miR132 were identified, a region of the 3⬘UTR
of p250GAP, a member of the Rac兾Rho family of GAPs, was
among the most highly conserved evolutionarily. A comparison of
the 3⬘UTRs of p250GAP reveals that the putative target site for
miR132 is conserved from humans to zebrafish (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, p250GAP is highly enriched in the CNS (39). To test
whether miR132 could block expression of p250GAP, we transfected a p250GAP-GFP reporter and miR132 precursor into
primary neurons. Cotransfection of miR132, but not miR1-1,
selectively repressed the expression of a luciferase gene that contained a p250GAP miRNA response element in its 3⬘UTR (data
not shown). Overexpression of miR132 reduced levels of
p250GAP-GFP whereas miR1-1 did not (Fig. 6B). Furthermore,

miR132 in vivo. To examine the specificity of miR132 regulation of
p250GAP protein expression, we blocked miR132 function in
primary neurons by using an antisense 2⬘O-methyl oligoribonucleotide. We found that this sequence-specific miRNA inhibitor increased levels of the p250GAP-GFP and endogenous p250GAP,
whereas a sense strand 2⬘O-methyl oligoribonucleotide did not (Fig.
6 D and E). As shown above, the antisense (but not the sense strand)
2⬘O-methyl oligoribonucleotide also blocked neurite outgrowth
(Fig. 5B). Because we did not observe an miR132-induced reduction in p250GAP mRNA (data not shown), we suggest that miR132
regulates p250GAP by a translational block.
Inhibition of p250GAP Expression Promotes Neurite Outgrowth. Be-

cause miR132 stimulates neurite outgrowth, our data suggests that
this phenotype is negatively regulated by p250GAP. To test this
hypothesis, we generated a shRNA that represses expression of

Discussion
Experiments more than a decade ago in the sea snail, Aplysia,
suggested a role for CREB in neuronal plasticity (6). Subsequently,
a large body of work has implicated CREB in a variety of adaptive
neuronal responses. Among the possible CREB targets, rapid
response genes have received the most attention. Nevertheless, few
CREB targets capable of directly regulating neuronal plasticity
have been identified. Our unbiased genome-wide screen allowed us
to identify many, if not all, potential CREB targets (10). Surprisingly, this screen revealed that a significant fraction of the rapid
response genes under CREB control had little coding potential (S.I.
and R.H.G., unpublished data). In the current study, we focused on
miR132 because it was one of the most highly inducible genes
characterized. We used overexpression and 2⬘O-methyl RNA
blockers to show that miR132 is a key regulator of cortical neuron
morphogenesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that miR132 downregulates the expression of p250GAP, a protein proposed to
regulate neuronal differentiation (39, 46). Consistent with the
hypothesis that p250GAP is a major target of miR132, knock-down
of p250GAP phenocopies the regulation of neuronal morphogenesis by miR132.
Studies showing that p250GAP regulates neurite outgrowth via
Rac兾cdc42 signaling are consistent with a role for miR132 in early
neuronal morphogenesis (39, 46). Of note, p250GAP also interacts
with the glutamate receptor NR2A兾B subunits, PSD-95, and

␤-catenin (39, 47). Interestingly, several additional predicted targets
of miR132 are known to regulate the development of postsynaptic
densities and spines. It is conceivable, therefore, that miR132
targets additional regulators of neuronal differentiation. The observation that miR132 is selectively expressed in zebrafish brain is
consistent with the idea that it plays a role in neuronal development.
The miRNA recognition element in p250GAP is one of the few
predicted targets that, like miR132 itself, is conserved from fish to
humans, suggesting a role for miR132 in vertebrate neurogenesis.
miR132 can be considered to be a rapid response gene because
its induction phase parallels that of c-fos (data not shown). However, mature miR132 shows a persistence not observed with other
CREB-regulated immediate early genes. The pairing of rapid
inducibility with persistent expression suggests that miR132 may
function as a signal-dependent switch that regulates neuronal
homeostasis over the long-term. Moreover, the ability of miRNAs
to down-regulate the synthesis of a population of proteins provides
a powerful mechanism for the coordinate control of neuronal
function. miRNAs and the RNA-induced silencing complex machinery are associated with polyribosomes and dendritic RNAbinding proteins, raising the possibility that miRNAs are localized
to discrete dendritic compartments (48, 49). Because some proteins
have half-lives on the order of minutes, it is conceivable that
induction of miR132 triggers a rapid and persistent downregulation of protein levels. Loss of function and over expression
experiments should help reveal the precise role of miR132 in
neuronal development and maturation. Conditional mouse mutants would also help determine whether miR132 contributes to
memory consolidation and long-term neuronal plasticity.

a striking increase in neurite outgrowth in cells transfected with the
p250GAP shRNA construct as compared to a control shRNA
construct (Fig. 7A). Morphometric analyses revealed that reduction
of p250GAP levels induced a marked increase in primary neurite
number and average total neurite length (Fig. 7B). These results
support the hypothesis that miR132 mediates neuronal outgrowth
by suppressing expression of p250GAP.
