ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION
First discovered in 1993 by Lee et al. (1), microRNAs
(miRNAs) form a class of small regulating RNA of
22 nt in length, able to post-transcriptionally regulate
the expression of target mRNAs. In most cases,
miRNAs interact with their target mRNAs via an

During the last two decades, microRNAs (miRNAs)
emerged as critical regulators of gene expression.
By modulating the expression of numerous target
mRNAs mainly at the post-transcriptional level,
these small non-coding RNAs have been involved
in most, if not all, biological processes as well as
in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases.
miR-132 and miR-212 are tandem miRNAs whose
expression is necessary for the proper development, maturation and function of neurons and
whose deregulation is associated with several
neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s
disease and tauopathies (neurodegenerative
diseases resulting from the pathological aggregation of tau protein in the human brain). Although
their involvement in neuronal functions is the
most described, evidences point towards a role of
these miRNAs in many other biological processes,
including inflammation and immune functions.
Incidentally, miR-132 was recently classified as a
‘neurimmiR’, a class of miRNAs operating within
and between the neural and immune compartments.
In this review, we propose an outline of the current
knowledge about miR-132 and miR-212 functions
in neurons and immune cells, by describing the
signalling pathways and transcription factors
regulating their expression as well as their putative
or demonstrated roles and validated mRNA targets.

imperfect matching occurring between the mRNA
30 -untranslated region (30 -UTR) and a region located
between nucleotides 2 and 8 in the 50 region of the
miRNA, referred to as the miRNA ‘seed’ region.
Depending on the complementarity degree of this interaction, miRNA can lead to the cleavage and degradation
of their mRNA targets (when the matching is perfect or
nearly perfect) or to their translational inhibition (when
the interaction involves more mismatches) (2). Currently,
over 1500 miRNA-encoding genes have been identiﬁed
in the human genome (miRBase), and bioinformatical
analyses based on the complementarity level between
miRNA seed regions and mRNA 30 -UTR predict that
each miRNA could regulate the expression of dozens to
hundreds of mRNAs (2,3). In addition, a particular gene
transcript could be the target of several miRNAs (4).
However, the predicted impact of miRNAs on target
mRNAs is probably underestimated since accumulating
data indicate that miRNA regions located outside the
seed region are involved in mRNA recognition and that
miRNAs can bind other regions than mRNA 30 -UTR,
including their 50 -UTR and coding sequence (2).
Moreover, miRNAs could also positively regulate gene
expression by enhancing mRNA translation and
inducing gene expression via target gene promoter
binding (5–8), thereby adding more complexity to their
initially described mode of action. Altogether, miRNAs
are believed to control the expression of one- to
two-third of human genes, which explains their involvement in most, if not all, physiological processes as well as
their association with numerous diseases when their
expression is deregulated (2,3,9,10).
Almost unknown 5 years ago, miR-132 and miR-212,
two miRNAs sharing close sequences highly conserved
among vertebrates (Figure 1), have been described in an
exponential number of publications during these last
years, pointing out the pleiotropic feature of these two
miRNAs. Most of what we currently know about their
regulation and biological functions emerged from studies
performed in the neuronal context. However, several

studies have also highlighted their involvement in inﬂammation and other biological (dys)functions. In this review,
we outline the main functions of miR-132 and miR-212 in
the neural and immune compartments, through the
description of their identiﬁed targets in different biological
processes as well as the molecular pathways involved in
the control of their expression.
THE GENOMIC FEATURES OF miR-212/132
CLUSTER
miRNA-encoding genes display different types of genomic
organizations: intergenic miRNAs are located outside
known transcription units whereas intragenic miRNAs
are embedded in exons or introns, or even overlap
exon–intron junctions of coding or non-coding genes
(9,11). miR-132 and miR-212 were ﬁrst reported to be
transcribed from the ﬁrst and stable intron of the
non-coding transcript DQ223059, localized on chromosome 10 in rats, and from the ﬁrst intron of the
non-coding transcript AK006051, localized on chromosome 11 in mice (12,13). However, another transcript
variant, likely resulting from an alternative splicing form
of the AK006051 transcript was then identiﬁed in mice,
with miR-132 and miR-212 sequences embedded in its
second exon (Figure 2). Interestingly, these variants
display tissue-speciﬁc patterns of expression, with the
ﬁrst variant being expressed in brain and testes and the
second one in brain, testes, heart and mammary glands
(14). Similarly to their rodent orthologues, hsa-miR-132
and hsa-miR-212 share the same primary transcript

(A. Wanet and A. Tacheny, unpublished data). In
addition, in human, they are found in an intergenic
region located on chromosome 17p13.3. miR-132 and
miR-212 exhibit similar mature sequences and share the
same seed region (Figure 1); they may therefore target the
same mRNAs. Nevertheless, this ‘double-targeting’ by
both miR-132 and miR-212 was only demonstrated for
few mRNAs so far and each of these miRNAs may also
repress speciﬁc targets (Tables 1 and 2). Although much
less studied than their guide-strand counterparts, it seems
important to mention that the miR-212/132 locus maturation also generates two additional miRNAs, miR-212*
and miR-132*, whose sequences are indicated in grey in
Figure 1c. As the functions of these miRNAs are still
unknown, the following sections will focus on miR-132
and miR-212. Nevertheless, one should keep in mind the
existence of the star sequences of these miRNAs, which
have been reported to be induced, like miR-132 and
miR-212, in cortical neurons stimulated by neurotrophins
(13), and that are expected to regulate different mRNA
target subsets than miR-132 and miR-212 as they exhibit
different sequences.
Regarding its transcriptional regulation, the miR-212/
132 locus was ﬁrst identiﬁed in neuronal cells as a target
of the cAMP-response element binding (CREB) protein
transcription factor by a group using an approach called
SACO (serial analysis of chromatin occupancy), enabling
the identiﬁcation of functional transcription factor
binding sites at the genome scale (12,15). Soon after,
another group using the same technique demonstrated
that in non-neuronal cells the miR-212/132 locus is

under the control of the transcriptional repressor
Repressor Element 1 silencing transcription factor/
neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) (16). As
illustrated in Figure 2, one REST and several CREBbinding sites are conserved among mammals in the
vicinity of miR-212/132 locus, suggesting an evolutionary

conserved involvement of CREB and REST in the control
of miR-212/132 expression.
As far as the maturation of miR-132 and miR-212 from
their primary transcript is concerned, relatively few data
are available so far. Wibrand and co-workers analysed the
pri-miR-212/132, pre-miR-212, pre-miR-132, miR-212
and miR-132 expressions during the long-term potentiation (LTP) of the rat adult dentate gyrus, and found
parallel increases in the expression of pri-miR-212/132,
pre-miR-212 and pre-miR-132, which suggests that the
pri-miR-212/132 is rapidly transcribed and rapidly and
efﬁciently processed in this context (the dentate gyrus is
a part of the hippocampus, which is considered to contribute to memories formation; the LTP is thought to be one
of the major cellular mechanisms that underlies learning
and memory). The elevations in mature miRNAs
were however not detected before 2 h later, suggesting
a slower processing of the precursors into mature
miRNAs. Besides, the elevation in mature miRNAs
levels was found to be much smaller (<2-folds) than that
of the primary and precursors forms (induced >50-folds),
which may suggest that the precursor processing to
mature miRNAs is limited, or may also reﬂect higher
basal levels of mature miRNAs (17). If such patterns of
maturation are observed in other contexts remains to be
determined. Moreover, in a number of studies, one of the
two miRNAs was found to be more induced than the
other one. Whether this phenomenon results from a
different stability of miR-132 and miR-212 and/or from
a preferential processing of one of the two hairpin precursors, and if this is linked to the pre-miR or miR sequences
also remains to be elucidated, in the different contexts
in which these miRNAs have been studied.

as the mammal conservation (the sites predicted to be conserved are assigned positive scores, while sites predicted to be fast-evolving are assigned
negative ones). These annotations are from the UCSC Genome Center and Ref. (14). Besides, the position of CREB and REST binding sites that
were demonstrated to be involved in miR-212/132 transcription (12,13,16) are indicated. Interestingly, all of the indicated binding sites for transcription factors are conserved among the mouse, rat and human genomes.

mechanism may also contribute to miR-212/132 expression in BDNF-stimulated neurons (13) (Figure 3).
miR-212/132 are required for neurons morphogenesis
miR-132 was shown to induce neurite outgrowth and to
modulate the dendritic morphology of both immature
cortical and hippocampal neurons by repressing
p250GAP expression (12,21), a GTPase-activating
protein involved in neuronal differentiation (22,23).
Beside its interaction with p250GAP mRNA, miR-132
also modulates dendritic plasticity by controlling the
expression of another target, methyl CpG-binding
protein 2 (MeCP2) (24) (Figure 3). While a decrease in
MeCP2 expression during the post-natal period postpones
neuronal maturation and synapses formation (25), its
over-expression triggers dendrite and axon arborization
(26), which suggests the need of maintaining MeCP2
levels between narrow ranges to ensure a proper
neuronal development (24). Interestingly, as MeCP2 was
suggested to control BDNF expression, which itself leads
to the induction of miR-212/132 expression, miR-132
would take part in a feedback mechanism involved in
the homeostatic control of MeCP2 expression (24).
miR-132 up-regulation resulting from the BDNF stimulation of cortical neurons is also involved, most likely
indirectly, in the BDNF-induced expression of the
glutamate receptors NR2A, NR2B and GluR1 (27)
(Figure 3), adding new mechanisms about the involvement
of miR-132 in synaptic functions.
Evidence emerging from in vivo studies demonstrated
that miR-132 effects on neuron morphogenesis are not
limited to in vitro cultured cells. Indeed, the deletion of
miR-132/miR-212 locus is associated with a decrease in
spine density and in dendrite length and arborization of
newborn neurons in the mice adult hippocampus.
As miR-132 is the main product of the miR-212/132
locus maturation in this context, miR-132 was proposed
to be required for the dendritic growth and arborization of
newborn neurons of the adult hippocampus (28). One may
have noticed that the reported positive effect of miR-132
expression on dendritic growth and arborization of
neurons appears in contradiction with the observation
that MeCP2 over-expression also results in dendritic and
axonal arborization (26), MeCP2 being a miR-132 target.
The reason of this apparent contradiction may be related
to the fact that miR-132 controls the expression of several
targets involved both in stimulating (like MeCP2) or
inhibiting neurite outgrowth and arborization (as
p250GAP). In addition, one cannot exclude the participation of still unidentiﬁed miR-132 targets in the positive or
negative control of neuron arborization.
Moreover, miR-212/132 primary transcript is
up-regulated upon mice neuronal stimulation and it was
suggested that miR-132 expression, that is speciﬁcally
localized in active synapses, may play a role in longterm synapse activation and contribute to memorization
processes (29). In addition, miR-132 participates to the
integration of newborn neurons into the adult dentate
gyrus, as it increases during neuron differentiation and
maturation, while its knockdown results in decreased

surprising that the majority of miR-132 and miR-212’s
functions were described in a neuronal context. Indeed,
CREB is known to be involved in neuronal survival,
maturation, differentiation and function, but also to
control developmental plasticity, memory formation,
adaptive behaviour, drug addiction and to regulate
circadian rhythms (18). REST, on the other hand, is a
transcriptional repressor known to actively repress
neuronal gene expression in non-neuronal cells by acting
as a scaffold protein enabling the recruitment, via the
co-repressors interacting with its repressor domain, of histone deacetylases and other epigenetic factors themselves
silencing the expression of REST target genes (19). Upon
neuronal differentiation however, REST is conjugated
to ubiquitin by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFbTRCP and
targeted to proteolysis, enabling the expression of its
target genes (20).
A functional binding site for REST has been located
between the miR-212 and miR-132 sequences (Figure 2),
and the involvement of REST in miR-132 expression has
been demonstrated as the expression of a dominant
negative form of REST in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts
results in an increased expression of miR-132 (16) (the
report does not mention its effect on miR-212 expression,
as that study focussed on brain-speciﬁc miRNAs and as
miR-212 involvement in neuronal functions was still
unknown at that time. Nevertheless, given that miR-212
and miR-132 are derived from the same primary transcript, one can deduce that the entire miR-212/132 locus
is under the control of REST). Similarly, the involvement
of CREB in the transcriptional control of miR-132
and miR-212 was ﬁrst demonstrated in rat (12) and
then in mouse (13) cortical neurons stimulated with
neurotrophins. At least four CRE sites are involved in
miR-212/132 transcription in mouse (Figure 2). Three of
them were ﬁrst identiﬁed in rat: one located between
miR-212 and miR-132, near the REST binding site and
the two others located immediately upstream of miR-212
sequence (12). In mouse, a fourth CRE binding site, highly
conserved, was more recently identiﬁed in the promoter of
the gene encoding AK006051 transcript, the three other
CRE sites located in the ﬁrst intron of this transcript
corresponding to the sites previously identiﬁed in rat
(13) (Figure 2).
Although only two transcription factors, REST and
CREB, have been formally demonstrated to control
the transcription of miR-212/132, other yet unidentiﬁed
transcriptional regulators must be involved. Indeed, the
deletion of the AK006051 transcript intron 1 nearly
abolishes the expression of a luciferase reporter gene
while the mutation of the three CRE sites localized in
this particular intron only slightly reduces the induction
of the luciferase following brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) stimulation (13). In addition, although
BDNF-induced CREB-dependent miR-212/132 transcription has been shown to depend on extracellular
signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation and
partly on mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase
1/2 (MSK1/2) activation, an unidentiﬁed ERK1/
2-dependent,
MSK1/2and
CREB-independent

synapse formation and impairs the functional integration
of newborn neurons (30).
Recent data also indicate that the miR-212/132 locus,
that is induced in the visual cortex of light-exposed mice,
would regulate the ocular dominance plasticity possibly
through miR-132 action on dendritic spine morphology
(ocular dominance is the tendency to prefer the visual
input from one eye to the other; the ocular dominance
plasticity refers to the possibility to modulate the ocular
dominance through the ability of the brain to reorganize
neuron connections in response to the visual experience,
a phenomenon that could occur post-natally during
a well-deﬁned sensitive period) (31,32). Interestingly, the
induction of pri-miR-212/132 expression in this model
would depend on post-translational modiﬁcations of
histone proteins located at CRE sequences close to
miR-132 and miR-212. More precisely, it was shown
that the light exposure increases the presence of histone
marks known to be regulated by visual experience. Indeed,
CRE loci located close to miR-132 sequence and upstream
of miR-212 sequence exhibit enhanced lysine 9 and

14 acetylation on histone 3, and the CRE site located
close to miR-132 moreover displays additional histone
modiﬁcations associated with light exposure (enhanced
phosphorylation of serine 10 and acetylation of lysine 14
on histone 3, and lysine 4 dimethylation on histone 3) (31).
miR-132 regulates circadian rhythms
Beside its induction by light exposure, a process dependent
on histone modiﬁcations (31), miR-132 is regulated
in a MEK1/2, CREB-dependent manner by photic cues
in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and displays an expression
proﬁle associated with circadian rhythms, reaching a
maximal expression during the subjective day (the subjective day is the part of the circadian cycle corresponding
to the illuminated period during an entrainment by
light–dark cycles) (33). From a functional point of view,
miR-132 would be involved in a negative response to
photic entrainment by attenuating the clock resetting triggered by light exposure, an effect that could be mediated
by the repression of the RFX4 (regulatory factor X4)
protein expression, a transcription factor highly expressed

Figure 3. Inducers and targets of the miR-212/132 locus in the neuronal compartment. In neurons, the transcriptional repressor REST is targeted to
proteolysis, enabling the transcription of its target genes. Various stimuli (such as the exposition to neurotrophins or photic cues, or an extended
access to cocaine) lead to the transcription of the miR-212/132 locus through CREB activation, although an unidentiﬁed ERK1/2-dependent,
MSK1/2- and CREB-independent mechanism may also contribute to miR-212/132 expression in BDNF-stimulated neurons (dashed arrow).
Histone 3 post-translational modiﬁcations are also involved in pri-miR-212/132 expression following light exposure. By repressing the expression
of several mRNA targets (AChE is a probable but not yet demonstrated target of miR-132 in neurons), miR-212/132 are involved in neurite
outgrowth and dendrite morphology as well as in the resetting of the circadian clock, and would participate to synaptic functions by up-regulating
the expression of the glutamate receptors NR2A, NR2B and GluR1. miR-132 expression deregulation is also associated with the development of
tauopathies through the targeting of PTBP2. Besides, miR-212 would be involved in regulating the vulnerability to cocaine addiction by targeting
Spred1 mRNA.

Nucleic Acids Research, 2012, Vol. 40, No. 11 4747

in suprachiasmatic nucleus and induced after light
exposure during the night. miR-132 would also
modulate the expression of period genes mPer1 and
mPer2, which are involved in the normal resetting of the
circadian clock (34), by repressing the expression of ﬁve
targets, three of which being involved in chromatin
remodelling, MeCP2, p300 and JARID1A (Jumonji,
AT-rich interactive domain 1A) (also called ‘retinoblastoma binding protein 20 ), and two being implicated in
protein translation repression, B-cell translocation gene
2 (BTG2) and polyadenylate-binding protein-interacting
protein 2 (PAIP2A) (35). By regulating the expression of
these genes (Figure 3), miR-132 would act as a master
factor for chromatin remodelling and protein translation
thereby enabling the ﬁne-tuned expression of genes
involved in the circadian clock entrainment (35).

The best-known example of cross-regulation between
transcription factors and miR-212/132 has recently been
demonstrated in the ﬁeld of drug addiction. It has been
reported that miR-212, and in a smaller extent, miR-132,
could themselves regulate the activity of both CREB and
transducer of regulated CREB (TORC), one of its
co-activators. Indeed, by repressing the expression of
sprouty-related, EVH1 domain containing 1 (SPRED1),
a protein known to inhibit Raf phosphorylation and activation (36), miR-212 is responsible for Raf1 activation
(37). As Raf1 GTPases increase adenylyl cyclase activity
(38), miR-212 over-expression leads to an increased cyclic
AMP production, triggering PKA activation and CREB
phosphorylation and activation. The CREB-dependent
gene expression is further ampliﬁed by a positive effect
of cAMP-dependent signalling on TORC, as cAMP
can protect TORC against degradation by inducing its
acetylation by p300 (37,39) and as PKA activity
promotes TORC nuclear relocalization (40) (Figure 3).
In this context, it was shown that by amplifying CREB
activity, which is known to negatively modulate the
reward response to cocaine, miR-212 expression can
protect from cocaine addiction by decreasing the responsiveness to the motivational properties of the drug (37).
Additional ﬁndings have shown that an interaction
between miR-212 and MeCP2 [a target of both miR-132
(24) and miR-212 (41)], occurring in the dorsal striatum, is
also involved in cocaine addiction. Indeed, striatal
MeCP2, whose expression is increased in rats with
extended access to cocaine, inhibits miR-212 expression
that, in turn, represses MeCP2 expression. As MeCP2
levels are themselves correlated to BDNF expression,
that controls cocaine intake, miR-212 would ﬁne-tune
the responses to drug abuse both by increasing CREB
signalling and decreasing BDNF expression, resulting in
a limited cocaine intake (42) [interested readers can refer
to (43) for a ﬁgure illustrating this BDNF–CREB–
MeCP2–miR-212 interplay]. The negative effect of
MeCP2 on miR-212/132 expression identiﬁed in this
study seems, a priori, in contradiction with the suggestion that the loss of MeCP2 would result in the

miR-212/132 deregulation is associated with several
brain-related diseases
Given their involvement in neuronal development and
functions, it is not surprising that deregulated expression
patterns for miR-132 and miR-212 have been associated
with developmental defects as well as brain-related
disorders. For example, a down-regulation of miR-212
has been identiﬁed in foetuses with anencephaly (44).
miR-132 expression is down-regulated in two mouse
models of Huntington’s disease (45), as well as in the
brain of human patients suffering from this pathology
(46). Moreover, miR-132 and miR-212 are both
deregulated in the prefrontal cortex of individuals
affected by schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (47,48).
Both miR-132 and miR-212 are down-regulated in
the brain of a-synuclein (A30P)-transgenic mice, a model
of Parkinson’s disease (49). miR-212 was also found to
be down-regulated in Alzheimer’s disease patients,
and its expression modulation correlates with the density
of neuroﬁbrillary tangles, a characteristic lesion of
Alzheimer’s disease (50). However, miR-132 downregulation in Alzheimer’s disease patients remains controversial, probably due to the differences in the populations
studied, the tissues analysed and the protocols used by
different groups (51,52). Recently, Smith and colleagues
found that miR-132 is also down-regulated in patients
suffering from progressive supranuclear palsy, a form of
tauopathy linked to abnormal ratios of four repeats- and
three repeats-tau isoforms (4R:3R tau ratios). The
involvement of miR-132 in this disease would be explained
by its ability to target the neuronal splicing factor PTBP2,
whose over-expression would lead to abnormal 4R:3R
tau ratios and the development of tauopathy (53).
Interestingly, a recent report also mentioned that the
in vivo microinjection of antagomirs targeting miR-132,
which is induced in the mice hippocampus following epileptic seizures, diminished the seizure-elicited neuronal
death (54).
Besides their numerous roles in neuronal development,
functions and related diseases, increasing evidences
point towards an important involvement of miR-132
and miR-212 in mediating inﬂammatory processes.
Subsequently, miR-132 was recently designated as a
‘NeurimmiR’, a class of miRNAs regulating both
neuronal and immune functions and was suggested to
function as a cross-talk between both systems (55). This
idea is strongly supported by the observation that, in vivo,
miR-132 knockdown in newborn neurons impairs
their integration in the adult dentate gyrus, while its
knockdown in PC12 cells results in the up-regulation of
pro-inﬂammatory gene expression (30). Indeed, Luikart

down-regulation of miR-132 expression through
decreased BDNF levels in rat cortical neurons (24).
However, although the effect of MeCP2 on miR-212/132
transcription may depend on cell types, we cannot exclude
that MeCP2 may exert an inhibitory effect on miR-212/
132 transcription in cortical neurons as well, which would
be hidden by the positive effect of BDNF on miR-212/132
expression.

et al. (30) suggested that the miR-132-regulation of
pro-inﬂammatory gene expression may be part of the
program necessary for the functional integration of
newborn neurons in the adult central nervous system. In
addition, the pre-incubation of cortical neurons with
glucocorticoids prevents the BDNF-dependent miR-132
induction and the downstream up-regulation of the
expression of glutamate receptors NR2A, NR2B and
GluR1 above-mentioned (27), suggesting another
possible link between neuronal and inﬂammatory
processes. As described in the next section, miR-132 and
miR-212 not only contribute to immune processes, but are
also regulated by inﬂammatory signals.

These last 5 years, several groups performing miRNA
expression proﬁling in diverse immune-related contexts
came to highlight the induction of miR-132 (and
miR-212) in several cell types including monocytes,
macrophages, mast cells and lymphatic endothelial cells.
miR-132 expression was ﬁrst described in the inﬂammatory context by the Baltimore’s group, who proﬁled the
expression of 200 miRNAs in the LPS-stimulated human
monocytic THP-1 cell line and showed that this miRNA,
among others, is up-regulated by this pro-inﬂammatory
signal (56). Intriguingly, the induction of pri-miR-212/
132 is not detected in LPS-stimulated primary murine
bone-marrow-derived macrophages, while it is in THP-1
cells (13). Whether these observations are due to the total
absence of a miR-212 and miR-132 induction in those
primary murine macrophages, or rather to a very transient
induction of the primary precursor, or to modiﬁcations
in the maturation of the primary and precursor
forms leading to increased miR-212/132 levels despite an
absence of transcriptional activation, remains to be
determined.
miR-132 is also induced in LPS-stimulated primary
human macrophages, as well as in the bone marrow and
splenocytes of LPS-treated mice, where it represses the
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) expression (57). By repressing the expression of AChE, an enzyme hydrolysing
the acetylcholine, considered as an important inhibitor
of peripheral inﬂammation, miR-132 would play a role
in the brain-to-body resolution of inﬂammation.
Although the regulation of AChE by miR-132 has been
demonstrated in splenocytes and macrophages, it
probably also occurs in the brain as suggested by the
authors, and in this manner plays a role in circadian
rhythms (57). Indeed, whereas AChE expression is
maximal during sleeping hours and minimal during
activity periods (58), miR-132 expression demonstrates
an opposite expression proﬁle (33). Incidentally, mice
overexpressing AChE exhibit circadian irregularities
when subjected to a reversal of the light/dark cycles (59).
Besides, the miR-132-AChE interaction may also regulate
neuron morphogenesis, as AChE is involved in neurite
outgrowth and extension (60,61). A regulation of AChE
by miR-132 in neuronal cells would also confer an indirect

role for this miRNA in the regulation of cholinergic
anti-inﬂammatory effects attributed to AChE (62).
It would therefore be of great interest to determine if the
AChE/miR-132 interaction occurs in neuronal cells, given
that recognized effect of the miR-132/212 locus expression
in neurons may be mediated partly through their interaction with AChE. These observations strongly suggest
that the consequences of miR-212/132 deregulated expression on circadian rhythms and neuron morphogenesis
are the results of changes in the expression of several
targets, and not only in those that were identiﬁed as
targets in these particular contexts.
In mouse and human mast cells activated by immunoglobulin E (IgE), the induction of miR-132 has been
shown to repress heparin-binding epidermal-like growth
factor (HB-EGF) expression. HB-EGF, which is
involved in cell proliferation, cell migration and wound
healing among other functions, also exhibits an increased
expression in IgE-induced mast cells. Therefore, by targeting HB-EGF mRNA, miR-132 might be involved in
a negative response to mast cells activation, limiting the
remodelling and stimulation of the tissue environment
upon chronic allergen exposure (63). Similarly, the induction of miR-132 and miR-212 in IL-12-stimulated primary
human natural killer cells negatively regulates the IL-12
signalling pathway through the repression of signal
transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4)
expression (64).
miR-132 and in a lesser extent, miR-212, are also
induced during primary human lymphatic endothelial
cells (LEC) and human foreskin ﬁbroblasts infection by
the Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV),
as well as during the infection of THP-1 by KSHV,
herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (65). The induction of miR-212/132 locus
in KSHV-infected LEC depends on the activation of
ERK and p38 MAPK but also on the activation of the
cAMP/PKA pathway, all of these signalling pathways
subsequently leading to the phosphorylation and activation of CREB. miR-132 induction upon viral infection
might also be part of the viral defensive strategy to
evade immunity. Indeed, miR-132 targets the transcriptional co-activator p300 (65), described to interact with
central actors of the inﬂammatory response (66,67) and
to play a role in the initiation of the antiviral response
(68). Therefore, the induction of miR-132 upon viral infection would facilitate viruses replication by inhibiting
the expression of genes known to be induced by the interferon response (65). Incidentally, the targeting of p300 is a
mechanism developed by several oncogenic DNA viruses
enabling them to evade the innate immunity (69). It is
worth noting that the induction of miR-132 upon viral
infection is transient, what could be, at least partly, explained by the fact that the transcriptional co-activator
p300 binds CREB to allow gene transcription activation
(65,66) and thus controls miR-132 expression. Therefore,
the repression of p300 expression by miR-132 would be
part of a negative feed-back loop leading to decreased
miR-132 expression (65).
From a clinical point of view, miR-132 is also,
among other miRNAs, up-regulated in peripheral blood

miR-212 AND miR-132: BESIDES THEIR
NEURIMMIR FUNCTIONS
Besides their involvement in neuronal processes and
inﬂammation, miR-132 and miR-212 have also been
described in a number of other ﬁelds, in studies enabling
the identiﬁcation of numerous other targets (Tables 1
and 2). Although not developed in this review, it is
worth mentioning that a number of reports suggested
that miR-212/132 expression could be regulated by
hormones, nutrition and metabolism, unveiling emerging
additional contexts in which miR-212/132 would exert
their regulatory roles.
The most documented emerging ﬁeld in which miR-212/
132 have been involved is probably cell transformation
and tumourigenesis—although this may likely result
from the increasing interest devoted to miRNA deregulation in cancer. As shown in Table 3, both miR-132 and
miR-212 were shown to be up-regulated or downregulated in different cancer types. Moreover, both
tumour-promoting and tumour-suppressing functions
(depending on cancer types) were attributed to miR-212/
132, unveiling the complexity of their involvement in
tumourigenesis. For example, miR-212 down-regulation
has been associated with the resistance/bad response to
several anti-cancer treatments (71–73), while a reduced
miR-132 expression was observed in good responders to
ifosfamide, an alkylating agent used in the treatment of
cancer (74). Other reports suggest that miR-212 would
negatively affect gastric cancer cells proliferation (41)
while miR-132 would contribute, in human tumours and
hemangiomas, to the angiogenic switch by stimulating
endothelial cell proliferation as well as their tube-forming
capacity through the targeting of p120RasGAP (75).
Regarding the involvement of miR-212/132 in pancreatic
cancer, some authors reported the down-regulation of

miR-132 in carcinoma tissues compared with their
non-cancerous counterparts (76) whereas others found
an elevated miR-212/132 expression in pancreatic cancer
patients (77), with opposite effects on pancreatic cancer
cell proliferation. Although one could speculate that the
divergent data obtained in these studies may partly result
from different genetic backgrounds in the populations
studied, further studies are needed to clarify the effect of
miR-212/132 expression on the proliferation of pancreatic
cancer cells. Nevertheless, these reports suggest the
possibility that a same miRNA may both positively and
negatively regulate certain cell functions.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
As outlined in this review, numerous studies have highlighted the important role of the miR-212/132 locus in
neuronal morphogenesis and function. However, the
activities of miR-212/132 are not limited to the neuronal
compartment and an increasing number of publications
point towards a participation of these miRNAs in inﬂammation and immune processes and importantly, in the
cross-talk between neural and immune functions.
The identiﬁcation of a number of targets enabled to
propose mechanisms by which miR-132 and/or miR-212
are involved in these processes. However, as miRNAs are
predicted to target numerous mRNAs, one should keep in
mind that the resulting effects of a deregulated expression
of these miRNAs might potentially results from modiﬁcations in the expression of other targets as well, as herein
exempliﬁed with the miR-132/AChE interaction. From
a transcriptional point of view, although REST and
histone modiﬁcations were both demonstrated to
regulate miR-212/132 transcription, the transcription
factor that transcends all the context-speciﬁc inductions
of miR-212/132 is undoubtedly CREB, which appears to
control their transcription in a wide variety of situations
and biological processes.

mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients suffering from
rheumatoid arthritis (70). Both the monocyte and
macrophage population of PBMC cells display a higher
expression of these miRNAs when compared with the
lymphocyte fraction, suggesting that monocytes and
macrophages most likely predominantly contribute to
the general up-regulation of these miRNAs—and particularly of miR-132—in PBMC (70). This is consistent with
data obtained in our group, indicating that miR-132 and
miR-212 are also induced in THP-1 monocytes and
macrophages stimulated by various inﬂammatory cytokines (A. Tacheny, unpublished data). This observation,
in consideration with the reported induction of miR-132 in
primary human macrophages treated with CpG oligonucleotides, a TLR9 ligand (57), suggests that miR-132
expression in human monocytes and macrophages would
be induced by bacterial and viral ligands and more generally by pro-inﬂammatory molecules. In addition, as
several validated targets of miR-132 and miR-212 participate in the inﬂammatory response (see Tables 1 and 2),
like STAT4, AChE, HB-EGF, p300, MeCP2 and SirT1,
one might consider these miRNAs as part of mechanisms
allowing the resolution of inﬂammation.

high levels, their physiological expression levels in
different cell types and conditions likely inﬂuence their
overall ability to repress the expression of a speciﬁc
mRNA target. A differential processing of miR-132 and
miR-212 may therefore account for their putative different
abilities to repress a target expression. A particular care
should therefore be taken when analysing the potential
inhibitory role of a miRNA on a target mRNA expression, as experiments involving the over-expression of
miRNAs may potentially identify interactions between
miRNAs and mRNA targets that cannot occur at physiological concentrations. Further studies are therefore
necessary in order to determine the extent to which
miR-132 and miR-212 functions are overlapping. A
possible scenario would be that miR-212 and miR-132
exert both redundant and speciﬁc functions, by being
kept under the same transcriptional control and regulated
differently at the post-transcriptional level, and/or by
targeting both common and speciﬁc mRNA targets.

Although miR-212 and miR-132 are simultaneously
transcribed, several studies have highlighted that one or
the other of these miRNAs was more strongly induced
and/or more expressed than the other one in different
contexts, raising the currently obscure question of the
regulation of miRNAs maturation and turnover. Several
proteins have been involved in the enhanced processing or
stability of particular subsets of miRNAs or even of
speciﬁc miRNAs [interested readers can refer to the
following reviews (78,79)], but if such actors are
involved in the preferential maturation and/or processing
of miR-132 or miR-212 remains to be determined.
Remenyi et al. (13) suggested that the loop sequences of
these miRNAs, which are highly conserved among vertebrates, may play a role in their processing, but the putative
proteins binding these loops are still unknown. On the
other hand, Lagos et al. (65) suggested that miR-212
would be less stable rather than differentially processed
compared to miR-132 in lymphatic endothelial cells, but
the maturation and stability of miR-212 and miR-132 may
also depend on cell types and physiological contexts.
Further studies are therefore clearly required to get
deeper insights into the post-transcriptional regulation
of miR-212/132.
Another incompletely addressed question so far relates
to the relative redundancy of miR-132 and miR-212
functions. The similarity of miR-212 and miR-132
mature sequences and more importantly their identical
seed sequences suggest that these miRNAs may result
from a gene duplication event in the evolution course.
It is therefore not surprising that these miRNAs share
several target mRNAs. However, as most studies do not
systematically investigate miR-212 and miR-132, it is
currently not well deﬁned if these miRNAs really have
speciﬁc targets, or if they mostly exert numerous and
overlapping functions. The currently prevalent model of
miRNA target recognition deﬁnes the miRNA seed region
as the critical determinant of the speciﬁc targets recognition. According to this model, miR-212 and miR-132
would be functionally equivalent. However, increasing
evidence also point towards a role of miRNA non-seed
nucleotides, including in their 30 region, in the target recognition (2). Indeed, base-pairing between the mRNA
target and the miRNA 30 region can either supplement
the traditional seed pairing, or compensate for
single-nucleotide bulge or mismatch in the seed region
(80,81). The diverging nucleotides between miR-132 and
miR-212 sequences (see Figure 1a) may therefore be
involved in speciﬁc target recognition. Moreover,
another likely important parameter of the interaction
between a miRNA and a target mRNA is the expression
level of the two partners. This is illustrated in the work of
Lagos and co-workers, who demonstrated that while
miR-132 inhibition in KSHV-infected lymphatic endothelial cells (that overexpress miR-132 compared with
non-infected cells) reverses its effect on p300 expression,
its inhibition in non-infected cells does not affect p300
levels. These results suggest that a critical level of
miR-132 is necessary for its ability to repress p300 expression (65). Therefore, although both miR-132 and miR-212
may target a same mRNA when expressed at sufﬁciently
