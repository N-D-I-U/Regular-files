Neuronal Activity-Dependent Regulation of
MicroRNAs
Su-Eon Sim1, Joseph Bakes1, and Bong-Kiun Kaang1,2,*
MicroRNAs are non-coding short (~23 nucleotides) RNAs
that mediate post-transcriptional regulation through sequence-specific gene silencing. The role of miRNAs in
neuronal development, synapse formation and synaptic
plasticity has been highlighted. However, the role of neuronal activity on miRNA regulation has been less focused.
Neuronal activity-dependent regulation of miRNA may finetune gene expression in response to synaptic plasticity
and memory formation. Here, we provide an overview of
miRNA regulation by neuronal activity including highthroughput screening studies. We also discuss the possible molecular mechanisms of activity-dependent induction
and turnover of miRNAs.

INTRODUCTION
Neuronal activity induces various cellular and molecular changes,
which results in the alteration of synaptic strength. In particular,
at the synapse level, each synapse shows dynamic responses
to specific neuronal activity within a few minutes, which implies
that fast and precise molecular machineries are indispensable
(Lee et al., 2009; Matsuzaki et al., 2004; Padamsey and Emptage, 2011).
Recent studies revealed a novel post-transcriptional regulatory system using small non-coding RNAs, so-called microRNAs
(miRNA), which inhibit protein synthesis by imperfect complementary binding to 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of target
mRNAs. Transcription of miRNAs produces long primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs), and then these are processed by Drosha to
precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) which form a single hairpin
structure. These pre-miRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm by
Exportin 5 and further processed by Dicer to ~23-nucleotidelong mature miRNAs. Mature miRNAs are loaded into the
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and bind to 3′UTR of

target mRNAs, which results in translational repression and/or
mRNA destabilization (Bartel, 2004; Im and Kenny, 2012;
Xiong et al., 2013). Translational repression of mRNA driven by
miRNAs is an attractive regulatory system for explaining rapid
local protein synthesis in response to neuronal activity (Huber
et al., 2000; Martin et al., 1997; Sutton and Schuman, 2006).
The evidence from many studies showing some miRNAs are
specifically enriched in dendrites and synaptosomes also implies the role of miRNAs in neuronal activity (Kye et al., 2007;
Lugli et al., 2008; Schratt et al., 2006; Siegel et al., 2009).
In this review, we summarize recent studies reporting activitydependent regulation of miRNAs and discuss how miRNAs are
regulated by various types of neuronal activity.

REGULATION OF miRNAs BY NEURONAL ACTIVITY
Numerous studies have shown that miRNAs are critically regulated by neuronal activity. We summarized a decade of research showing direct regulation of miRNAs in response to
various types of neuronal activity (Table 1).
miR-132
The first and most studied miRNA induced by neuronal activity
is miR-132. Many studies have shown a consistent increase of
miR-132 after various types of neuronal activity such as brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), KCl (membrane depolarization) and bicuculline (GABAR Receptor inhibition) in cultured
neurons (Chai et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2007; Vo et al., 2005;
Wayman et al., 2008) and seizure, contextual fear conditioning,
odorant stimulus, light, cocaine intake and visual stimulus in
particular brain regions of living animals (Cheng et al., 2007; Im
et al., 2010; Nudelman et al., 2010; Tognini et al., 2011). Moreover, reduced neuronal activity such as monocular deprivation
in visual cortex decreases both pre- and mature miR-132,
strengthening the evidence for neuronal activity-dependent
miR-132 induction (Mellios et al., 2011; Tognini et al., 2011).
The induction of miR-132 is regulated by cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) which is a crucial stimulus-induced transcription factor regulating many fast-response genes
and playing a key role in dendritic development and synaptic
plasticity. Studies using pharmacological inhibitors showed that
the induction of miR-132 requires activation of NMDA receptor,
CaM kinase and MEK-ERK pathways (Cheng et al., 2007;
Wayman et al., 2008).

Neuronal Activity-Dependent Regulation of MicroRNAs
Su-Eon Sim et al.

Fig. 1. Possible mechanisms for neuronal activity-dependent miRNA regulation. There are
two possible mechanisms for miRNA induction.
2+
First, the influx of Ca îá~ NMDAR activates a
calcium-dependent enzyme, calpain. Activated
calpain is known to release Dicer from PSD
and to stimulate Dicer RNAse III activity, which
facilitates the process of pre-miRNAs into mature miRNAs. Second, increased intracellular
2+
Ca
level triggers downstream signaling
pathways and induces ÇÉ= åçîç miRNA transcription. However, little is known about the
mechanism of miRNA turnover. One possible
mechanism is the activity-dependent degradation of RISC. MOV10, RISC factor, is degraded by proteasome in activity-dependent
manner, but is still not clear whether this degradation of MOV10 induces the disassembly
of RISC and the turnover of miRNA.

miR-212
miR-212 is another CREB-dependent miRNA. The locus of
miR-212 is located only 200 bases upstream from that of miR132 and the promoter regions of both miR-132 and miR-212
have CRE sequences (Magill et al., 2010; Remenyi et al., 2013;
Vo et al., 2005). There are fewer studies about miR-212 compared to miR-132. Kenny and colleagues have studied the role
of miR-212 in cocaine addiction related to CREB signaling in
dorsal striatum (Hollander et al., 2010; Im et al., 2010). Authors
showed that miR-212 is specifically induced by extended but
not restricted cocaine access and amplifying CREB signaling
îá~ a novel molecular feed-forward circuit.
miR-134
The regulation of miR-134 is more complicated than other
miRNAs. Schratt et al. (2006) showed that synaptodendritically
localized miR-134 negatively regulates dendritic spine size by
repressing the translation of target Lim-domain-containing protein kinase 1 (LimK1) mRNA. After BDNF treatment, the translation of LimK1 is increased by the relief of miR-134 inhibition,
which suggests miR-134-associated silencing complex is inactivated or diminished at the synaptodendritic compartment. On
the other hand, Fiore et alK showed that BDNF stimulation increases the level of pre-miR-134 îá~ ÇÉ= åçîç miR-134 transcription. In their paper, the authors showed that the miR-134
gene is included in a large cluster of miRNAs (more than 50
miRNAs) and polycistronically transcribed by the activityregulated transcription factor, myocyte enhancing factor 2
(Mef2) (Fiore et al., 2009). The results of these two studies
imply that miR-134 might be regulated differently in the local
synaptodendritic compartment compared to the global transcription level. Moreover, a recent paper suggested a new possibility. It showed activity-dependent response of miR-134 is
only restricted to certain types of cortical interneurons, Somatostatin (SST) and Calretinin positive interneurons (Chai et al.,

http://molcells.org

2013). The authors of this paper compared the induction of
miR-134 and miR-132 by BDNF-stimulation in hippocampal
culture, and found a relatively small increase of miR-134 compared to that of miR-132. Therefore, they measured cell typespecific responses using a fluorescent miRNA sensor (Magill et
al., 2010) and found an activity-dependent response restricted
to SST and Calretinin positive interneurons. There are two
studies supporting this cell type-specific regulation of miR-134.
First, similar results were observed in the study of Bramham
and colleagues. When the levels of miR-132, miR-212 and
miR-134 were measured 2 h after áå=îáîç long-term potentiation
(LTP) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, two
CREB-regulated miRNAs, miR-132 and miR-212, showed a
significant increase but the level of miR-134 was unchanged
(Wibrand et al., 2010). More evidence can be found in a fabulous study by Huang and colleagues. Using conditional GFPmyc-Ago2 transgenic mice and various Cre recombinase mice,
the authors revealed cell type-specific expression profiles of
miRNAs. In their results, the expression of miR-134 is more
enriched in parvalbumin (PV), SST and glutamate decarboxylase 2 (GAD2) positive GABAergic interneurons than Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKIIα)
positive glutamatergic pyramidal neuron, whereas miR-132 and
miR-212 are predominantly expressed in CaMKIIα positive
neurons (He et al., 2012). More research is required to clarify
the exact activity-dependent regulation of miR-134.
miR-124
The brain-enriched and highly conserved miRNA, miR-124, has
been studied largely for its role in neuronal development (Cao
et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2009; Landgraf et al., 2007; Makeyev
et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2008). Kandel and colleagues first demonstrated the activity-dependent regulation of miR-124 in ^éäóJ
ëá~= Å~äáÑçêåáÅ~. miR-124 showed restricted expression in the
sensory neuron compared to the motor neuron. The treatment

The study of Krol et al. (2010) provides clear evidence of dynamic regulation of miRNAs by a stimulus. Several retinal
miRNAs, miR-183/96/182 cluster, miR-204 and miR-211, were
dynamically up- and down-regulated by light. The levels of
these miRNAs were remarkably decreased by dark adaptation
and rapidly recover to their maximum levels within 30 min after
return to light.

of five spaced pulses of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) which
induces long-term facilitation (LTF) at the sensory-to-motor
synapse decreased the level of mature miR-124, whereas the
treatment of one pulse of 5-HT did not show any change. The
decrease of miR-124 is dependent on the MAPK signaling
pathway but not on PKA, PKC and the proteasome pathways
(Rajasethupathy et al., 2009). The decrease of miR-124 by
neuronal activity was also observed in the mammalian nervous
system. Chronic cocaine administration induced a significant
decrease of precursor miR-124 in the caudate putamen and
decrease of mature miR-124 in the hippocampus, in the nucleus accumbens and in the caudate putamen. The significant
up-regulation of repressor element 1 silencing transcription
factor (REST), a transcriptional repressor which inhibits the
expression of miR-124 (Conaco et al., 2006), in the nucleus
accumbens and in the caudate putamen suggests the decrease of miR-124 is mediated by the regulation of REST
(Chandrasekar and Dreyer, 2009).

Chemical stimulation in hippocampal slices
The study of Park and Tang examined a time-dependent
change in miRNAs after chemical LTP (c-LTP) or metabotropic
glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluRLTD) in hippocampal slices. Among 237 miRNAs tested by
microarray, 50 miRNAs and 59 miRNAs were increased more
than 8 folds after c-LTP and mGluR-LTD stimulation, respectively. Interestingly, most of the miRNAs were increased within
15 min after c-LTP and 30 min after mGluR-LTD (Park and
Tang, 2009).
In vivo electrical stimulation
The rapid induction of miRNAs was also observed in living
animals. Electroconvulsive shock was given to induce massive
and synchronous depolarization of hippocampal neurons. Expression levels of miRNAs measured by Taqman low-density
array showed that most miRNAs were increased rapidly within
1 h (Eacker et al., 2011).
Bramham and colleagues performed microarray analysis using the high frequency stimulus (HFS) paradigm for áå=îáîç LTP
in DG of urethane-anesthetized rats. Tested time points were
10 min and 2 h after HFS, and only 2 h after-HFS showed significant miRNA expression changes. The expression levels of
10 miRNAs were increased and 11 miRNAs were decreased
among 237 tested miRNAs (Wibrand et al., 2010). Compared
to a previous study (Park and Tang, 2009), fewer miRNAs were
induced at the delayed time point and even some miRNAs
were decreased. We believe these milder changes were
caused by different stimulus protocols. The HFS stimulation

used in this paper is considered closer to physiological conditions compared to the chemical stimulus used in the previous
study.
Chemical stimulation in neuron cultures
The study of van Spronsen et al. (2013) examined the activitydependent change in miRNA using mature primary hippocampal neuron cultures. The authors investigated the change in
264 miRNAs after NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity
or homeostatic synaptic plasticity using microarray analysis. A
chemical LTP or a chemical long-term depression (LTD) protocol was used for NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity,
which induced a change in expression of 51 miRNAs. For homeostatic synaptic plasticity, either voltage-gated sodium
channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX, suppress action potential) or
GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (increase synaptic activity) was treated for 4 h or 48 h. Prolonged change of synaptic
activity in neuron culture altered the expression of 31 miRNAs.
Behavioral stimulation and pathogenic condition
Specific experiences may induce the changes in miRNA expression. Kye et al. (2011) studied the change in miRNAs in the
hippocampus after contextual fear conditioning. The expression
of 187 miRNAs in the hippocampal CA1 region was measured
by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) at three different time
points after training (1 h, 3 h, and 24 h). Astonishingly, a single
training session significantly changed the expression level of
almost half of measured miRNAs (90 miRNAs). Sur and colleagues screened miRNAs in the primary visual cortex (V1)
responding to visual deprivation îá~ microarray analysis.
Among the top 100 most highly expressed miRNAs in V1, the
expression level of 21 miRNAs was altered by visual deprivation. The authors verified the altered 21 miRNAs using qRTPCR, and confirmed that the expression of 9 miRNAs was
changed (Mellios et al., 2011).
Interestingly, there is a report showing that miRNA dysregulation is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (CamposMelo et al., 2013). This study analyzed the expression profile of
664 miRNAs in the sporadic ALS spinal cord tissues. The results showed that there is a specific group of dysregulated
miRNAs and that specific miRNA dysregulation might be related to the selective suppression of neurofilament miRNA observed in sporadic ALS.

MECHANISM OF ACTIVITY-DEPENDENT miRNA
REGULATION
Mechanism for induction
There are two possible mechanisms for the induction of miRNA
(Fig. 1). The first mechanism is suggested by the finding which
showed neuronal activity induces the cleavage of Dicer and
increases its RNAse III activity. This study showed that enzymatically inactive Dicer is enriched at postsynaptic densities
(PSD), and is released and activated by calcium-dependent
calpain activation (Lugli et al., 2005). Because Dicer is a key
enzyme to produce mature miRNAs, the release of active Dicer
might process most of the pre-miRNAs located in dendritic
spine all at once. This mechanism may explain the results of
previous studies reporting fast induction of many miRNAs after
stimulation (Eacker et al., 2011; Park and Tang, 2009). The
second miRNA induction mechanism is ÇÉ=åçîç transcription of
miRNAs by activity-regulated transcription factors such as
CREB and Mef2. As mentioned above, many studies have

http://molcells.org

shown CREB-dependent induction of miR-132 and miR-212
(Nudelman et al., 2010; Remenyi et al., 2013; Vo et al., 2005;
Wayman et al., 2008) and one study proved Mef2 binds upstream of the miR-379-410 cluster, which includes the miR-134
gene, and transcribes the gene in an activity-dependent manner (Fiore et al., 2009). There is still another mechanism for
regulating miR-134 transcription. Tsai and colleagues found
that the mammalian Sir2 homolog, SIRT1, forms a repressor
complex with transcription factor, Yin Yang 1 (YY1), and binds
upstream of miR-134 to inhibit its expression (Gao et al., 2010).
Even though this paper did not demonstrate a direct induction
of miR-134 after neural activation, other evidence clearly suggests transcriptional regulation of miR-134 îá~ SIRT1 and YY1.
Mechanism for turnover
Compared to induction of miRNA, little is known of the activitydependent neuronal miRNA turnover. This lack of attention
might be related to previous studies which have shown that
miRNAs are highly stable and have slow turnover rates (Bhattacharyya et al., 2006; Gantier et al., 2011; van Rooij et al.,
2007). Meanwhile, Krol et al. (2010) provide a new insight into
the nature of miRNA turnover, reporting that miRNAs in neuron
have rapid turnover rates that are dependent on neuronal activity. The level of miRNAs in mouse retina was rapidly, within a
few hours, decreased after transcriptional shut-down îá~ transcription inhibitors. This fast turnover of neuronal miRNA was
also observed in non-retinal neurons, such as organotypic hippocampal slices, hippocampal and cortical culture neurons and
even neurons derived from mouse embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, the authors showed that the treatment of TTX blocks
rapid turnover of miRNAs, which implies that the high turnover
rate of neuronal miRNAs is dependent on neuronal activity.
Until now, almost nothing is known about the mechanism for
neuronal activity-dependent miRNA turnover. One possible
mechanism is the degradation of RISC by neuronal activity (Fig.
1). In aêçëçéÜáä~, Armitage, one of the RISC factors, is rapidly
degraded after neuronal activity (Ashraf et al., 2006). Kosik and
colleagues also observed the activity-dependent degradation of
MOV10, a mammalian ortholog of Armitage (Banerjee et al.,
2009). Both Armitage and MOV10 are degraded by the proteasome.

CONCLUSION
Synaptic activity across neurons is the most fundamental feature of neurons. We focused here on how neuronal activity
regulates the level of miRNAs. From a decade of efforts, a
good body of evidence has elucidated the mechanism of miRNA regulation. Particularly, high-throughput studies provide
new insights for understanding global changes in miRNAs.
In the future, more studies about cell type-specific or neuronal
circuit-specific miRNA regulation are demanded to understand
the diversity and complexity of brain function.
