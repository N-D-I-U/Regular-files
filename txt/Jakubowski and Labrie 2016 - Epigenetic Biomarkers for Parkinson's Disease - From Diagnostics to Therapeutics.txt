Abstract. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative illness that is often diagnosed after significant pathology
and neuronal cell loss has occurred. Biomarkers of PD are greatly needed for early diagnosis, as well as for the prediction
of disease progression and treatment outcome. In this regard, the epigenome, which is partially dynamic, holds considerable
promise for the development of molecular biomarkers for PD. Epigenetic marks are modified by both DNA sequence and
environmental factors associated with PD, and such marks could serve as a unifying predictor of at-risk individuals. Epigenetic
abnormalities have been detected in PD and other age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, some of which were reported to
occur early on and were reversible by PD medications. Emerging reports indicate that certain epigenetic differences observed
in the PD brain are detectable in more easily accessible tissues. In this review, we examine epigenetic-based strategies for
the development of PD biomarkers. Despite the complexities and challenges faced, the epigenome offers a new source of
biomarkers with potential etiological relevance to PD, and may expand opportunities for personalized therapies.

INTRODUCTION
Biomarkers are molecules that represent a pathological signature that is easily identified and
quantified for a particular disease or disorder [1].
In recent years biomarkers have proven essential
in identifying individuals at risk for disease, tracking disease progression, and selection of therapeutic
intervention [2]. Despite their clinical importance
and extensive genetic studies, there are currently no
definitive biomarkers for PD available for use in
research or diagnostics.
It is estimated that by the time a patient with PD
sees a physician for the hallmark motor symptoms
of rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia, and postural

instability, up to 70% of the patient’s dopaminergic neurons have already been lost [1]. One of the
major aims of biomarker research in PD is to provide both medical professionals and researchers with
tools that enable accurate diagnosis before extensive neuronal death has occurred [1]. In addition to
monitoring at-risk individuals for early diagnosis,
biomarkers may expedite drug discovery and development. Current clinical trials for PD use relatively
subjective measures such as motor activity, behavior,
and mood to assess treatment efficacy [3]. This makes
such trials extremely expensive and labor-intensive,
especially considering that more than 90% of drugs
entering clinical trials for brain diseases do not yield
marketable compounds [4]. Adding biomarkers to
clinical trials may reduce this drug failure rate. In
clinical trials for cancers, biomarker-based studies
have had considerable success, to the point that there
are now biomarker-driven “basket” trials underway,

which enroll patients based on genetic biomarkers independent of tumor histology [5, 6]. The use
of biomarkers rather histopathological diagnosis in
these basket trials has generated enormous interest,
because they implement a hypothesis-driven strategy
for incorporating precision medicine into clinical trials. In PD, accurate and measurable biomarkers have
the potential to add great value to clinical trials by
identifying patient subgroups that are more likely
to be treatment-responsive and by providing quantifiable measures of disease outcome and treatment
response.
Recent investigations suggest that epigenetic
marks may be a new source of biomarkers for PD (see
Fig. 1). Epigenetics refers to heritable and acquired
alterations in gene activity and expression, without
changes in DNA sequence. The epigenome is partially dynamic, such that stable epigenetic changes
can occur in fully differentiated, post-mitotic cells
in response to environmental signals [7]. Epigenetic
marks, such as biochemical modifications of DNA
and of histone proteins, regulate gene expression
by controlling DNA accessibility and signaling to
the transcriptional machinery [8, 9]. To date, DNA
modifications, which includes DNA methylation and
other covalent cytosine modifications, have been the
most commonly investigated epigenetic marks for
biomarker discovery studies. Historically, DNA modifications were thought to occur exclusively within
CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) sites, but it is
now established that DNA modification occurs at
non-CpG sites as well, particularly in brain neurons
[10–12]. Other epigenetic marks, such as post-

translational modification of histones and noncoding
RNAs, frequently act in concert with DNA modifications, affecting chromatin accessibility and structure
as well as the recruitment of various transcription factors and protein complexes [13–15]. By modifying
genomic activities, epigenetic mechanisms impact
downstream protein amounts, cellular function, and
phenotypic outcome. The epigenome also exhibits
considerable heterogeneity between tissues, tissue
subregions, and cell types within an organism, which
enables the divergent biological roles of tissues and
cell types [13]. In the brain, epigenetic mechanisms
are central to neurodevelopment, synaptic transmission, and plasticity [16–18]. Epigenetic abnormalities
have been implicated in the mechanism of numerous
brain illnesses, including PD [19].
Epigenetic investigations of PD may yield
biomarkers involved in disease pathogenesis. PD has
numerous complex, non-Mendelian features that are
consistent with the dynamic nature of the epigenome.
Such features includes the prevalence of sporadic,
non- familial PD cases (∼90%); the low concordance
rates (only 11%) between monozygotic twins for sporadic PD [20]; the 1.5-2 times higher risk of PD in
males relative to females [21]; diurnal fluctuations
in symptom severity (sundowning syndrome) [22];
and the various agricultural and industrial chemicals associated with increased PD risk [23–25]. The
epigenome is well known to vary between monozygotic twins [26], respond to sex hormones [27],
exhibit circadian fluctuations [28] and affect neuronal functions following exposure to PD-associated
environmental toxins [29–31]. Moreover, epigenetic

J.L. Jakubowski and V. Labrie / Epigenetic Biomarkers for Parkinson’s Disease

mechanisms may contribute to the greatest risk factor for PD: aging. Epigenetic variation accumulates
in aging cells, even between genetically-identical
individuals, a phenomenon often referred to as “epigenetic drift”. In most tissues, including the brain,
there are rapid changes in DNA modifications in
the early life period, but these changes gradually
slow over the life span [12, 32–34]. Epigenetic aging
affects genomic locations differentially: promoterassociated CpG islands tend to increase in DNA
methylation with age, while areas with high DNA
methylation (i.e. repetitive elements in intergenic
regions) tend to lose methylation with age [33, 35–37]
Epigenomic alterations during aging are mediated
not only by external/environmental factors but by
genetic factors as well. There are numerous sites
in the genome that exhibit allele-specific epigenetic
differences, which have been shown to be haplotypedependent, highly tissue-specific, and prevalent in
the brain [38–40]. Different DNA haplotypes can
demonstrate markedly different epigenetic changes
with age, which affects phenotypic outcome [41].
Thus, the epigenome can serve as a convergence point
for genetic and environmental risk factors of disease,
making it an attractive means of detecting heritable
and nonheritable disease risk, disease progression,
and treatment efficacy in biomarker applications.

CANDIDATE BIOMARKER LOCI
Recent studies have begun to search for epigeneticbased biomarkers using candidate gene and genomewide approaches. DNA modifications, particularly
DNA methylation, are being used as successful
biomarkers for several types of cancer [42, 43], and
they show the most promise for epigenetic biomarker
development in neurodegenerative disease. Effective PD biomarkers based on DNA methylation
status will greatly depend on the concordance of
this epigenetic mark between brain and more easily
accessible tissues, such as blood. This is challenging, because epigenetic patterns are significantly
different between tissue types (such as brain and
blood) [44]. Indeed, data from the NIH Epigenomics
Roadmap and ENCODE projects demonstrate tissue and cell-type specific DNA methylation patterns
at key genes implicated in PD [13, 45]. Epigenetic
divergence between blood and brain can be further
amplified by aging, environmental, and stochastic
factors. Moreover, capacity to detect reliable epigenetic patterns within blood (and other tissues) can be

3

skewed by variability in cellular composition. This is
an important consideration for developing epigenetic
biomarkers to examine whole blood, because the sensitivity and reliability of the test needs to exceed
circadian fluctuations [46] and inter-individual differences in blood leukocyte populations [47]. Thus,
the reliability and extent to which peripheral tissues
are able to mirror the non-dividing cells of the brain
represents a major hurdle for epigenetic biomarker
strategies. Nonetheless, several studies suggest that
DNA methylation profiles at certain genes in blood
can distinguish control subjects from PD cases, opening a new source for biomarker discovery in PD.
At present, the most studied epigenetic-based
biomarker for PD is DNA methylation in the
␣-synuclein gene. ␣-Synuclein is a presynaptic neuronal protein that has been linked to familial and
sporadic cases of PD. ␣-Synuclein is the principal
component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, the
hallmark protein inclusions of PD. Increases in ␣synuclein levels lead to its abnormal aggregation and
to neuronal degeneration in vivo [48, 49] Elevated
␣-synuclein mRNA has been observed in individual
laser-captured dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of sporadic PD cases [50]. DNA methylation
in the promoter element of the ␣-synuclein gene
(a CpG island located in intron 1) was reported to
be essential for the regulation of ␣- synuclein transcription [51]. Moreover, DNA methylation at the
␣-synuclein intron 1 promoter was reduced in postmortem brain tissue (particularly the substantia nigra)
of patients with sporadic PD [51, 52]. The change in
DNA methylation at ␣-synuclein intron 1 in the substantia nigra appears to be specific to PD, as it was
not observed in cohorts including individuals with
Lewy body dementia [52, 53]. Loss of DNA methylation at the ␣-synuclein promoter could explain the
increase of ␣-synuclein mRNA in sporadic PD, which
in turn leads to Lewy body formation and neurotoxicity. However, this conclusion merits caution, as
the tissues analysed in these epigenetic studies have
the potentially confounding factors of neuronal loss,
medication differences, and limited sample size.
Encouragingly, recent studies of blood have supported the reduction in DNA methylation at the
␣-synuclein gene in PD cases when compared with
healthy controls. A relatively large study of the
peripheral blood of 490 sporadic PD patients and 485
healthy controls observed significant hypomethylation at the ␣-synuclein intron 1 promoter in the PD
cases [54]. This was replicated in three additional,
independent studies [55–57]. The ␣-synuclein DNA

4

methylation patterns in blood mirrored those of the
brain of PD patients [56], suggesting that ␣-synuclein
DNA methylation signatures in blood may be a good
proxy for the brain changes at this loci in PD.
However, there has been some conflicting reports
on the detection of DNA methylation differences
at the ␣-synuclein intron 1 promoter in PD [58,
59]. Though certain studies in the PD substantia
nigra reported large DNA methylation differences
(>30%) at select CpGs [51, 52], studies in blood have
detected much smaller DNA methylation differences
between PD cases and controls (∼5%) (52, 53, 54,
55). Low sample numbers (n ≤ 50) may account for
why some studies did not identify DNA methylation differences at ␣-synuclein in PD blood [58, 59].
Discrepancies in the selection of CpG sites examined at the ␣-synuclein promoter and differences in
PD clinical subtypes have likely also contributed to
the conflicting findings [55, 58, 59]. Overall, modest
DNA methylation differences in peripheral tissues
and genomic target selection represents significant
challenges for epigenetic biomarkers. The robustness and suitability of ␣-synuclein-based epigenetic
biomarkers may be improved by further work examining patient and clinical variables, including PD
subtypes, symptoms, genetic risk carriers, and age
groups.
Age-dependent changes in DNA methylation have
also been observed at the ␣- synuclein intron 1 promoter [54, 60]. In sporadic PD patients, age of onset
was positively correlated with DNA methylation at
␣-synuclein intron 1, where the greater the methylation levels, the later the occurrence of motor
symptoms [54]. Age-dependent differences in DNA
methylation at ␣-synuclein intron 1 in blood are,
however, relatively low (<10%). Interestingly, across
ages, lower levels of DNA methylation at ␣-synuclein
intron 1 were detected in males relative to females
[54]. Further studies will be needed to determine
whether this could contribute to the known higher
incidence of PD in males [21].
Finally, levodopa treatment, the mainstay treatment for PD [61], reverted the age- dependent
hypomethylation at the ␣-synuclein intron 1 promoter in a dose-dependent manner [54]. Levodopa
also increased DNA methylation at this promoter in
drug-naive blood cells cultured from PD patients [54].
Though levodopa altered DNA methylation status at
numerous other genes (3% of genes assayed) in blood
samples from PD patients, these findings do suggest
that DNA methylation at the ␣-synuclein gene may be
a useful biomarker for predicting treatment response

and for aiding the discovery of new drugs. In addition,
the ability of levodopa to reverse hypomethylation at
the ␣-synuclein gene suggests that studies of treated
PD individuals may have underestimated ␣-synuclein
hypomethylation. Consequently, this biomarker may
be more appropriate for early diagnostics, i.e., prior
to levodopa treatment.
Supporting this idea, DNA methylation at the
␣-synuclein intron 1 promoter did not have good
sensitivity for discerning treated PD patients from
healthy controls; DNA methylation status at ␣synuclein intron 1 identified only about 40% of
PD patients [54]. However, the specificity of DNA
methylation at ␣-synuclein intron 1, i.e., its capacity to correctly identify healthy individuals, was
∼76% [54], which is a higher specificity than the
current gold standard for determining Parkinsonian
syndromes, the DaTscan method (DaTscan specificity is 67% and sensitivity is 98%) [62]. Thus,
␣-synuclein methylation may best serve as biomarker
for early diagnosis in untreated individuals and as a
predictor of responsiveness to levodopa treatment.
In neuronal cells, ␣-synuclein has been shown to
sequester the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 from
the nucleus into the cytoplasm, resulting in a global
loss (30%) of DNA methylation in the brains of PD
patients [63]. This indicates that many more genomic
sites could have DNA methylation changes in PD,
and that there may be many more epigenetic-based
biomarkers. Genome-wide scans have the potential to
expedite the discovery of such epigenetic biomarkers.
One approach is to perform a genome-wide search
for differentially methylated sites in PD patients relative to controls, and determine whether there are
sites that show concordant methylation differences in
both blood and brain. Investigation of blood and cortical samples from the same individuals found 124
sites that were differentially methylated in PD and
had concordant cross-tissue changes in DNA methylation [64]. Many of the cross-tissue, differentially
methylated sites had previously been implicated in
PD in transcriptional or genome- wide association
studies (GWAS) [64, 65]. Epigenetic abnormalities
common across tissues in PD suggest that the epigenetic risk at these loci was inherited or acquired in
early development.
Another genome-wide strategy for biomarker identification is to examine easily accessible tissues
of living Parkinson’s patients at an early or prodromal stage in the disease. A study examining
drug-naive, sporadic Parkinson’s patients at the onset
of motor symptoms found transcriptomic changes in

J.L. Jakubowski and V. Labrie / Epigenetic Biomarkers for Parkinson’s Disease

the chromatin remodeling and methylation machineries [66]. This suggests that widespread epigenetic
differences occur early in PD, prior to pharmacological treatment, and that such differences may be useful
biomarkers for prodromal PD cases.
Familial and sporadic PD has been shown to
exhibit many common DNA methylation abnormalities, particularly at gene enhancer elements in stem
cell-derived dopaminergic neurons [67]. As an extension to this, a genome-wide search for common DNA
methylation disturbances across diseases with overlapping neuropathological features could identify
new, pathogenically-relevant biomarkers. In addition
to PD, ␣-synuclein inclusions have been detected
in dementia with Lewy bodies, Alzheimer’s disease,
and Down syndrome [68, 69]. Whole-genome DNA
methylation analysis found more than 700 loci with
DNA methylation abnormalities that were common
across multiple neurodegenerative diseases [70]. This
study also detected 1400 sites in common between
PD and Lewy body dementia [70]. Though limited
by sample size, this study represents a starting point
for follow-up research seeking biomarkers that are
shared across neurodegenerative illnesses.

EPIGENETIC STRATEGIES FOR
REFINING GENETIC BIOMARKERS
A strength of genetic biomarkers of disease risk
is their ease of detection in peripheral tissues, such
as saliva and blood, as well as the certainty that
they are detectable prior to symptomatic onset. Idiopathic PD is mediated by mutations in genes such
as ␣-synuclein, parkin, PTEN-induced kinase 1, and
leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), but these
account for only about 10% of all cases [71]. The
majority of PD cases are sporadic. Genetic variants
have been implicated in sporadic PD [72], although
the contributions of these risk variants are not well
defined. Recent GWAS meta-analyses examining 7.8
million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
13,708 PD cases and 95,282 controls reported 28
independent risk variants for PD [73]. The overwhelming majority (>90%) of identified risk SNPs
are located in intergenic regions, and as a result their
roles in gene function and disease pathogenesis are
not evident [74]. However, several of the top GWAS
risk SNPs for PD demonstrated allelic differences in
nearby DNA methylation levels [73]. Furthermore, a
GWAS risk SNP in intron 1 of the ␣-synuclein gene
(rs3756063) was found to modify DNA methylation

5

at the overlapping ␣- synuclein promoter in the blood
and brain of PD patients [54, 56]. Epigenetic analysis can therefore provide insight into the functional
effects of SNPs, which aids in prioritizing candidate
sites for biomarker development.
Disease-associated SNPs are, for the most part, in
linkage disequilibrium with many other SNPs. This
means that SNPs identified in GWAS are often not
the true disease risk factor, but rather one of the
co-inherited SNPs is likely responsible for disease
risk. As a result it may be impossible to identify
true causal variants using GWAS alone. Epigenetic
profiling of regions surrounding co-inherited SNPs
could be a useful approach to revealing true risk variants. This was shown in an elegant recent study by
Soldner et al. [75], who identified a SNP allele that
can up-regulate the ␣-synuclein gene by 10–20%.
This SNP was identified by intersecting PD- associated SNPs in the ␣-synuclein locus (463 SNPs)
with publicly available epigenetic data generated by
the NIH Roadmap. This effort revealed two SNPs in
␣-synuclein intron 4 that overlapped histone marks
characteristic of enhancers. Enhancers are distal regulatory elements that increase the expression of genes,
and enhancer activity is determined by epigenetic
status. The authors then tested the effects of the
SNP alleles using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing
technique in human pluripotent stem cell-derived
neurons. The G-allele of SNP rs356168 was found
to significantly increase ␣-synuclein mRNA expression and was associated with greater PD disease risk.
This is one example of a DNA variant that modifies
disease risk via epigenetically-controlled regulatory
elements. However, there are certainly many more,
because studies of the adult brain have found that PDassociated SNPs are enriched in distal enhancers [76].
Analysis of active enhancers overlapping PD risk loci
have also implicated tissues outside of the central
nervous system [45]. Such research indicates that epigenetic analysis at PD-associated SNPs can generate
molecular biomarkers for detection of disease vulnerability. In addition, combined epigenetic–genetic
analysis can pave the way for the development of
genetically-modified cell lines useful for drug candiadate screening and therapeutic discovery.

MITOCHONDRIAL EPIGENETIC
TARGETS
Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) represents only 1% of the total cellular DNA,

6

J.L. Jakubowski and V. Labrie / Epigenetic Biomarkers for Parkinson’s Disease

mitochondrial gene products are essential for normal
cell function. Thus, it stands to reason that mtDNA
would be studied for epigenetic changes, yet only
recently have research efforts moved beyond nuclear
DNA (nDNA) and into mtDNA. While methylation of nDNA is well established, methylation of
mtDNA has been a controversial matter [77]. Arguments against mtDNA methylation have included
the idea that methylases could not access the mitochondria in eukaryotes, and that mtDNA is devoid
of histones as it is arranged in nucleoid clusters
that adhere to the mitochondrial membrane [78].
Recently, however, both methylated mtDNA and the
DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 have been found
within the mitochondria [79, 80]. In the central
nervous system of humans, mitochondria also contain the de novo methyltransferase DNMT3a [81].
Changes in mtDNA methylation have been associated with environmental toxins, oxidative stress, drug
treatment, disease, and aging [82]. Methylation levels of mtDNA were analyzed in the brain of 4- and
24-month old mice, and it was found that hydroxymethylation, but not methylation levels in mtDNA
decreased with age in the frontal cortex [83].
Recently, mitochondrial methylation and hydroxymethylation were examined in the D- loop region
(which regulates mitochondrial transcription and
replication [84]), and the NADH dehydrogenase 6
(MT-ND6) gene in the substantia nigra of PD cases
and healthy controls. Strikingly, the D-loop region of
mtDNA in the PD brain showed a loss of methylation
in nearly all CpG and non-CpG sites relative to control samples [85]. Methylation levels in the MT-ND6
gene and hydroxymethylation in the D-loop were
unchanged in PD cases relative to controls [85]. This
supports the hypothesis that reduced methylation levels in the D-loop was not the result of diminished
neuronal content in the PD substantia nigra, but rather
that there was epigenetic misregulation of a site
important to mitochrondrial function in PD. If further research shows concordance between blood and
brain, the methylation status of the D-loop of mtDNA
could become a diagnostic biomarker for PD.

PRODROMAL BIOMARKERS AND
ENDOPHENOTYPES
In order to develop disease-modifying and neuroprotective therapies, biomarkers that can discern the
prodromal phase of PD will be necessary. Prodromal
PD refers to the stage before the disease has fully

manifested, when very early signs and symptoms of
the disease are present, but diagnosis using the current
motor symptom criteria is not yet possible [86]. Prodromal PD involves a range of non-motor symptoms –
such as sleep dysfunction, severe constipation, lateonset hyposmia, and episodes of major depression
– that often pre-date the motor symptoms by years.
Identifying biomarkers for the prodromal period is
complicated because the period in which these early
symptoms dominate is poorly defined, with estimates
ranging from 5–20 years [87]. Furthermore, there
is extensive inter-individual variability for many of
the non- motor symptoms. At present, there is no
accepted combination of symptoms to assist clinicians in definitively diagnosing prodromal PD.
One method of predicting whether individuals presenting non-motor symptoms may develop the full
illness is by examining their ‘epigenetic clock’. It
has been repeatedly shown that DNA methylation
status at specific CpG sites in the genome reliably
changes with age such that it can be used to accurately predict chronological age [36, 88, 89]. In a
study by Hovarth, DNA methylation datasets for
8,000 samples from various tissues were used to construct and evaluate a predictor of DNA methylation
age [89]. Astonishingly, this age prediction method
shows chronological accuracy across both sexes and
in most cell and tissue types, including blood, breast,
kidney, liver, and brain [89, 90]. It detected accelerated epigenetic aging due to progeria [89], obesity,
Down syndrome [91], and HIV infection [92], and it
predicted all-cause mortality even after adjusting for
various risk factors [93]. In the blood of PD patients,
the epigenetic clock tool found accelerated epigenetic
aging [94]. In addition, genes linked to accelerated
epigenetic aging in the brain had significant overlap
with those implicated in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases [95]. Analysis of epigenetic aging
in PD also identified striking differences in blood
cell type composition between PD cases and controls. Specifically, blood from PD patients contained
more granulocytes and fewer T-helper and B cells
than did control samples [94]. Accelerated epigenetic aging in combination with altered immune cell
counts may precede the onset of motor and cognitive
symptoms in PD, which could be a useful biomarker
for predicting progression to PD in prodromal
individuals.
Emerging evidence suggests that disruption of circadian rhythms may not only be a consequence of
neuronal loss in PD, but may itself contribute to the
neurodegenerative process [96]. Circadian rhythms

J.L. Jakubowski and V. Labrie / Epigenetic Biomarkers for Parkinson’s Disease

are physiological and behavioral cycles generated
by an endogenous biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus [97]. Circadian rhythms regulate
many physiological and behavioral functions, such
as 24-h rhythmicity in rest-activity behavior, body
temperature, hormone levels, and homeostasis [97].
Numerous studies have reported that the symptoms
and behaviors associated with PD, such as disruption
in motor activity, sleep dysfunction, and responsiveness to dopaminergic treatments, show diurnal
fluctuation [46]. These observations indicate there are
circadian influences on the expression of PD’s clinical features. Genes that control circadian rhythms are
known as clock genes. Several clock genes have been
identified including period (PER1, PER2, and PER3),
cryptochrome (CRY1 and CRY2), CLOCK, BMAL1,
and NPAS2 [46]. Histone modifications and DNA
modifications regulate many of these clock genes
and can exhibit circadian fluctuations [28, 98–100].
In PD, a circadian regulator, the NPAS2 gene promoter, was shown to have a 13% decrease in DNA
methylation relative to controls [100]. Clock genes
are known to greatly interact through complex feedback loops to generate and sustain circadian rhythms.
Hence, aberrant DNA methylation of key clock genes
in the PD brain may potentiate widespread circadian
deregulation and neuronal dysfunction.

CONCLUSION
While the epigenome has promise for both prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for PD, it is not
without its limitations. The ability to detect these
biomarkers using noninvasive means will be crucial, and it is known that epigenetic marks, such
as DNA methylation, vary widely across tissues.
Another critical challenge is that the size of the epigenetic differences observed in patients will have to
substantially exceed the variation within populations
and cell composition of the assay tissue. Detection
of the epigenetic signal will also have to reliably
surpass the technical noise of the assay. Although
there is now a wide range of tools to measure epigenetic marks, sensitivity and specificity come at a
price. Many of the current platforms require specialized, expensive equipment that would make the use
of these tests cost prohibitive. Furthermore, determining which specific genomic locations are most
appropriate for epigenetic biomarker development is
challenging. Detection of histone marks, though not
as streamlined and practical for clinical biomarker

7

purposes, could be used to predict which genomic
sites have biomarker potential. Since there are many
types of histone modifications, researchers could use
this diversity of histone marks to determine which
sites in the genome are most homologous between
tissues, such as blood and brain. Sites demonstrating consistently similar histone modification profiles
between brain and peripheral tissues are likely more
reliable for epigenetic (and genetic) biomarker applications. As such, analysis of histone modification
patterns can refine the discovery and development of
DNA modification biomarkers for PD.
Despite its current limitations, epigenetics represents an auspicious target for PD biomarkers.
Both stool- and blood-based epigenetic tests are
already commercially available for early-stage colorectal cancer, and there are many more epigenetic
based biomarkers in clinical studies [42]. Since DNA
methylation patterns at specific genomic sites in the
blood of PD patients can mirror those of brain,
there is promise for these types of tests for PD.
Not only could epigenetic marks serve to predict
and diagnose patients, but epigenetic information
could also help determine which patient subgroups
would benefit most from a treatment. For example, in
patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma, MGMT
promoter methylation is predictive of a favorable
response to temozolomide chemotherapy [43]. Epigenetic biomarkers therefore can greatly expand the
potential for personalized therapeutics.
Integrating epigenetic information with existing
PD diagnostic tools may enhance early detection, the confidence of diagnosis and therapeutic
approaches. For example, neuroimaging techniques
such as DaTscan, which is used to detect the
density of dopaminergic transporters in the brain,
helps clinicians distinguish PD from atypical
parkinsonian disorders. Patients, however, are typically symptomatic before this tool is used [101].
Epigenetic-based biomarkers could rapidly discern
individuals at greater risk, which would prompt clinical monitoring and neuroimaging earlier; enhancing
detection of prodromal PD cases. In addition, the
combination of DaTscan and epigenetic biomarkers
could also predict which patients will be most responsive to the main drug for PD, levodopa, given that
dopaminergic treatments affect DNA methylation at
the ␣-synuclein gene [54]. Epigenetic biomarkers
may also predict therapeutic utility of the newer treatments targeting ␣-synuclein which are currently in
clinical trials [102]. Finally, epigenetic biomarkers
could be used in combination with genetic screens

8

to identify individuals at risk for familial and sporadic forms of PD. Recent studies suggest that
phenotypic effects of sequence variants can be influenced by accompanying epigenetic signatures, via
allele-specific methylation. Studies demonstrating
the abundance of allele-specific methylation in the
brain [39, 103] and its presence at PD risk genes [75]
may lead to the development of novel combinatorial genetic-epigenetic biomarkers for PD. Though
still at a very early stage, epigenetic research in PD
may unify the aging, environmental and genetic risk
factors, and thus change the strategies used in PD
diagnosis and treatment.
