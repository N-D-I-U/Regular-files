Inflammation involves a coordinated, sequential, and self limiting
sequence of events controlled by positive and negative regulatory
mechanisms. Recent studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs),
an evolutionarily conserved class of endogenous 22-nucleotide
noncoding RNAs, contribute to the regulation of inflammation by
repressing gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. In this
study, we characterize the profile of miRNAs induced by LPS in
human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and monocytes. In
particular, we identify miR-9 as the only miRNA (among 365
analyzed) up-regulated in both cell types after TLR4 activation.
miR-9 is also induced by TLR2 and TLR7/8 agonists and by the
proinflammatory cytokines TNF-␣ and IL-1␤, but not by IFN␥.
Among the 3 different genes encoding miR-9 precursors in humans,
we show that LPS selectively induces the transcription of miR-9 –1
located in the CROC4 locus, in a MyD88- and NF-␬B-dependent
manner. In PMN and monocytes, LPS regulates NFKB1 at both the
transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, and a conserved
miR-9 seed sustained a miR-9-dependent inhibition of the NFKB1
transcript. Overall, these data suggest that TLR4-activated NF-␬B
rapidly increases the expression of miR-9 that operates a feedback
control of the NF-␬B-dependent responses by fine tuning the
expression of a key member of the NF-␬B family.

T

he innate immune response is the first line of defense against
infectious agents and is mainly exerted by phagocytes, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and monocyte/
macrophages. This response is triggered by the recognition of
pathogen-associated molecular patterns of invading microorganisms by members of the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TLR) superfamily
(1) among others. These receptors signal through similar intracellular pathways that start with the recruitment to the TollIL-1R (TIR) domain present in the receptor tail with 1 of 4
possible TIR domain-containing adaptor molecules. The combination of adaptor molecules involved not only depends upon
the specific TLR engaged, but also defines the consequent
cellular events. In particular, the MyD88 and TIR domaincontaining adapter protein/MyD88 adapter-like protein
(TIRAP/MAL) mediates the early NF-␬B activation, while the
TIR domain-containing adapter inducing IFN␤/TIR-containing
adapter molecule-1 (TRIF/TICAM-1) and TRIF-related
adapter molecule/TIR-containing adapter molecule-2 (TRAM/
TICAM-2) mediate the delayed NF-␬B and IFN-regulatory
factor (IRF) 3 signals (2, 3). As examples, TLR4 induces
proinflammatory cytokines via either a MyD88-dependent rapid
activation of the transcription factor NF-␬B or costimulatory and
antiviral proteins through a more delayed activation of both
NF-␬B and IRF-3 mediated by TRIF. Conversely, TLR3 exclusively signals through the TRIF-dependent pathway and does not
activate the MyD88-dependent pathway (2, 3). Importantly, a

ways have evolved to prevent an inappropriate inflammatory
response following activation of TLRs. These include the regulation of TLR expression, the production of molecules that
compete with their ligand binding or signaling activities, and the
generation of dominant negative splice variants or posttranslational modifications of signal transducers of the TLR signaling
cascade (4, 5).
An emerging class of regulators of gene expression is represented by microRNAs (miRNAs), which act at the posttranscriptional level via an RNA interference mechanism (6, 7).
miRNAs biogenesis involves the initial transcription by RNA
polymerase II of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNA), which are
subsequently cleaved by the RNase III enzyme Drosha and Dicer
to produce the 21- to 23-nt double-stranded RNA duplexes (6).
The mature miRNA guide strand is then loaded into the
miRNA-induced silencing complex, where it guides the recognition and translational repression or degradation of target
mRNAs (8). In mammals, a host of genes are processed to
produce over 700 miRNA (miRNA registry at www.sanger.ac.uk/
Software/Rfam/mirna), which have been implicated in a wide
array of biological processes ranging from cellular development
and differentiation to tumors (6, 7). Recently, activation of the
innate immune response also has been associated with changes
in the expression of selected miRNAs [namely miR-146 (9, 10),
miR-155 (11, 12), miR-132 (10), and miR-125b (12)]. However,
the ability of inflammatory ligands to modulate miRNA expression and, more importantly, the role of regulated miRNAs in the
development of an adequate immune response are just beginning
to be explored.
Herein, we report the profiles of miRNAs induced by inflammatory stimuli in human PMN and monocytes and identify
miR-9 as a previously unrecognized LPS-responsive miRNA
induced in a MyD88- and NF-␬B-dependent manner in both cell
types. We also show that miR-9 takes part of a regulatory
circuitry controlling cell activation by means of inhibitory feedback loop acting at the level of NFKB1, a transcriptional
regulator with a key role in the inflammatory response.

origin, the miRNA pattern of expression was investigated in
PMN and monocytes stimulated for 8 h with 100 ng/ml LPS using
a TaqMan-based Low Density Array. As shown in Fig. 1, LPS
induced an up-regulation of 12 miRNAs in PMN and/or monocytes while no miRNA was significantly down-regulated (Fig. 1).
LPS-induced miRNAs identified in the array were evaluated in
a time-course analysis by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2). Consistent with the
array data, the expression of miR-155, miR-132, miR-146a,
miR-146b, miR-187, miR-125a, miR-99b, and let-7e rapidly
increased in LPS-treated monocytes but not in PMN (Fig. 2).
Interestingly, both 3⬘-end (miR-9) and 5⬘-end (miR-9*) forms of
miR-9 were the only miRNAs consistently induced by LPS in
both PMN and monocytes, being already detectable after 2 h and
steadily increasing over the time period assessed (Fig. 2 and
supporting information (SI) Fig. S1 A). Up-regulation of miR-9
expression in PMN and monocytes stimulated with LPS for 24 h
was further confirmed in Northern blot analysis (Fig. S1B).
Conversely, the induction of miR-222 and miR-196a observed in
the array analysis was not confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis (not
shown). miR-9 was then chosen for a more detailed analysis,
given that it is the only miRNA up-regulated in response to LPS
in both cell types and that it has not been previously reported to
be involved in the inflammatory response.

downstream of the pattern-recognition receptor TLR4 (1). To
investigate the requirement of MyD88 and/or TRIF adaptors in
the induction of miR-9 expression by LPS and to evaluate miR-9
regulation by other TLRs, PMN and monocytes were stimulated
with Pam3CSK4 (100 ng/ml), a synthetic lipoprotein agonist at
TLR2 that selectively requires TIRAP/MyD88; Resiquimod
(R848, 10 ␮M), a TRL7/8 ligand signaling through MyD88 only;
or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] (50 ␮g/ml), a synthetic mimetic of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that
interacts with endosomal TLR3 and utilizes TRIF-mediated
signaling (1). As shown in Fig. 3A, activation of TLR2 and
TLR7/8 resulted in up-regulation of miR-9 expression in both
cell types, while that of TLR3 was ineffective. Conversely,
poly(I:C) readily induced miR-155 in monocytes (Fig. S2), as
previously reported in other cell types (11), demonstrating that
the lack of miR-9 induction was not due to a general failure of
monocytes to activate the TRIF-dependent pathway downstream TLR3. In agreement with the lack of TLR3 expression in
human PMN (13), poly(I:C) had no effect on miR-9 expression
in this cell type (Fig. 3A). Taken together, these data suggest that
in human phagocytes, activation of the MyD88-dependent signaling pathway is necessary and sufficient to increase miR-9
expression in response to LPS and that no additional TRIFdependent signals are required.
To test whether cytokines involved in the response to bacterial
and/or viral infection are also effective at inducing miR-9
expression, PMN and monocytes were stimulated with TNF-␣ (5
ng/ml), IL-1␤ (20 ng/ml), IFN␥ (1000 U/ml), or IFN␤ (1000
U/ml). The proinflammatory cytokines TNF-␣ and IL-1␤ increased miR-9 levels in both PMN and monocytes, while IFN␥
and IFN␤ were ineffective (Fig. 3A). Since miR-9 is up-regulated

by both LPS and TNF-␣, we tested whether TLR4 induction of
miR-9 required a TNF-␣ autocrine signaling as previously
reported for miR-155 (11). Anti TNF␣ MoAbs completely
blocked miR-9 induction by TNF-␣, but were ineffective when
LPS was used (Fig. 3B), indicating that TNF-␣ is not involved in
the induction of miR-9 by LPS. In addition, up-regulation of
miR-9 expression was not modified by treatment with brefeldin
A before LPS stimulation, ruling out the possible involvement of
soluble mediators released in response to LPS for miR-9 upregulation (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data candidate miR-9
as a novel miRNA involved in the responses of human phagocytes to selected stimuli of bacterial origin or proinflammatory
cytokines.
In both mouse and human genomes, miR-9 can be generated
by processing of 3 different miR-9 primary transcripts encoded
by distinct genes (C1orf61 for pri-miR-9–1, BC036480 for
pri-miR-9–2, and CR612213 for pri-miR-9–3, respectively). LPS
induced a time-dependent increase in pri-miR-9–1 levels and
had no effect on the other 2 miR-9 primary transcripts, both in
PMN and monocytes (Fig. 4A). The miR-9–1 primary transcript
derives from the C1orf61 locus which encodes for CROC-4
protein, a transcriptional activator for the c-fos proto-oncogene
(14). An EST database analysis revealed the existence of an
internal product of the C1orf61 locus. Both transcriptional units

miR-9–1 precursor and are activated by LPS in PMN and
monocytes (Fig. S3B). Analysis of the C1orf61 locus with the
transcription start sites predictor SwitchGear software (available
at http://genome.ucsc.edu) supports the existence of an internal
transcriptional unit. Inspection of the genomic sequence located
2 kb upstream of the predicted start sites of the 2 transcripts
identified putative promoter regions with consensus binding
sites for known LPS-sensitive transcription factors, including
NF-␬B (Fig. S3A). The observation that miR-9 induction by LPS
depends on the activation of the MyD88 pathway and the
identification of NF-␬B consensus binding sites within the 2
putative pri-miR-9–1 promoters suggested that the miR-9 induction by LPS may result from the transcriptional activity of
NF-␬B. This hypothesis was confirmed by the suppressive effect
on LPS-dependent miR-9 induction of NF-␬B inhibitors (MG132, BAY-117082 and PDTC) (Fig. 4B). In contrast, inhibitors
of p38 (SB-203580) and JNK (SP-600125) were ineffective (Fig.
4B). Collectively, these data demonstrate that in PMN and
monocytes inflammatory stimuli sustain the NF-␬B-dependent
transactivation of C1orf61 locus and consequent production of
pri-miR-9–1.
To gain insight on the biological relevance of miR-9 induction
under inflammatory conditions, we searched for predicted
miR-9 targets, focusing our attention on regulators of transcription, which have been frequently shown to be preferential
miRNA targets (15). In agreement with this, the public database
of animal miRNA miRGen (available at http://www.
diana.pcbi.upenn.edu/miRGen/v3/miRGen.html), which integrates analysis from PicTar (16), MiRanda (17), and TargetScan
(18), predicted among high score miR-9 targets the transcriptional regulators Onecut2 and PRDM1/Blimp-1, which have
been previously validated as miR-9 targets but are not expressed
in PMN and monocytes (data not shown). A miR-9 seed was also

predicted in one of few highly conserved regions present in the
3⬘-UTR of the NFKB1 gene (Fig. S4A). Interestingly, the
potential regulatory loop between NF-␬B and miR-9 was also
confirmed by the miPromotor software. Thus, to test whether
miR-9 postranscriptionally affects NFKB1, reporter construct
containing the renilla luciferase gene fused to the NFKB1
3⬘-UTR (luc-NFKB1) was transiently transfected in HEK-293
cells together with expression plasmids encoding miR-9. As
shown in Fig. 5, miR-9 significantly reduced luc-NFKB1 luciferase activity, and the introduction of point mutations in the
miR-9 seed in the 3⬘-UTR of NFKB1 (luc-mut-NFKB1) reverted
the inhibitory activity of miR-9, demonstrating that the NFKB1
3⬘-UTR contains an active seed of miR-9. The specificity of
miR-9 was also demonstrated by the lack of effect on a c-fos
3⬘-UTR reporter construct (luc-fos), which does not contain a
miR-9 seed. Conversely, the c-fos 3⬘-UTR presents a miR-155
seed (Fig. S4B) and was significantly inhibited by miR-155, in
agreement with previous reports (19) (Fig. 5).
Finally, we analyzed the expression profile of NFKB1 in PMN
and monocytes stimulated with LPS at the transcript and protein
levels (Fig. 6). Interestingly, LPS rapidly induced a consistent
increase in NFKB1 transcripts in PMN and monocytes (Fig. 6A),
but the transcript up-regulation was not paralleled by a comparable increase of the corresponding protein, which showed
constant expression levels (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that
NFKB1 is subjected to a LPS-dependent regulation at the
transcriptional level and suggest that a second regulatory mechanism, acting at the posttranscriptional level, is also operative. In
agreement with this finding, monocytes overexpressing miR-9
(Fig. 6C) showed a reduced expression of the endogenous
NFKB1/p105 protein (Fig. 6D). Conversely, transfection of
monocytes with either the pcDNA3 empty vector or with the
miR-155-encoding vector (Fig. 6C) did not alter the levels of
expression of the endogenous NFKB1/p105 protein (Fig. 6D),
confirming the specificity of the effect of miR-9.
Discussion
In the last few years, miRNAs have emerged as a class of gene
expression regulators involved in a variety of biological processes
(7, 20), and recent evidence indicates that they also play a major
role in immunity (21). In particular, miRNAs have been involved
in myeloid and lymphoid differentiation (22–25), as well as in the
induction of an appropriate adaptive immune response (25–27).

A rapid increase in the expression of selected miRNAs has also
been recently observed during the activation of an innate
immune response (10–12), but the relevance of miRNAs in this
process is just beginning to be explored.
In this study, we investigated the potential involvement of
miRNAs in the regulation of innate immune response by evaluating the profile of miRNAs expressed in human PMN and
monocytes after TLR engagement or cytokine activation. An
RT-qPCR-based screening on human monocytes exposed to
LPS not only confirmed the induction of miRNAs previously
described in monocytic cell lines or mouse macrophages, namely
of miR-146 (10), miR-155 (11, 12), and miR-132 (10), but also

uncovered the induction of previously unrecognized miRNAs,
including miR-187, the miR-125a/miR-99b/let-7e cluster, and
miR-9/9*. Interestingly, out of the 365 tested, miR-9/9* was the
only miRNA induced by LPS also in human PMN.
Initially identified as a brain-specific miRNA, miR-9 has been
implicated in mammalian neuronal development and function,
notably by inhibiting expression of antineurogenic transcription
factor-encoding genes (28, 29). Outside the central nervous
system, miR-9 was subsequently found to play a critical role in
the control of the secretory function of insulin-producing cells by
maintaining appropriate levels of the transcription factor Onecut2 (30), and more recently it was shown to down-regulate the
transcription factor PRDM1/Blimp-1 in Hodgkin/ReedSternberg cells, thus interfering with normal B-cell terminal
differentiation and contributing to the pathogenesis of Hodgkin
lymphoma (31). To our knowledge, the identification of miR-9
as an LPS-responsive miRNA in primary human PMN and
monocytes represents the first evidence linking miR-9 to the
innate immune response.
Several lines of evidence support the notion that miR-9 is
directly induced by LPS via the MyD88/NF-␬B-dependent pathway. First, LPS efficiently up-regulated miR-9 expression in
human PMN, in which TRL4 engagement does not activate the
TRIF-dependent pathway (32). Second, activation of TLR3, the
only TLR known to transduce its signal independently from
MyD88 (1), does not modulate miR-9 expression. This observation supports the conclusion that in monocytes the induction
of miR-9 proceeds in a MyD88-dependent manner, even though
in these cells both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent signaling
pathways can be simultaneously activated downstream TLR4. By
contrast, activation of TRIF-dependent pathway downstream of
TLR3 is sufficient to induce miR-155 expression in monocytes as
previously reported (11). Finally, activation of TLR2 and
TLR7/8, known to engage only the MyD88-dependent pathway,
led to increased miR-9 expression in both PMN and monocytes.
Taken together, these data rule out any contribution of the
TRIF-dependent pathway downstream of TLR4 to LPS-induced
miR-9 expression. TLR4 activation also leads to the production
of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF␣ and IL-1␤, in both
PMN and monocytes and to the production of antiviral type I
IFN in monocytes. In turn, these mediators can signal through
their receptor in an autocrine fashion. However, we provide
demonstrations indicating that induction of miR-9 by LPS occurs
in a direct manner, without the involvement of endogenous
mediators. First, activation of PMN and monocytes with IFN␤
does not promote miR-9 expression. Secondly, even though
TNF␣ is able to induce miR-9 expression, its presence is not
required for TLR4-mediated production of miR-9 because incubation of PMN and monocytes with anti-TNF␣ antibodies
before LPS stimulation did not suppress the up-regulation of
miR-9 expression. Finally, inhibition of protein secretion by
brefeldin A does not impair LPS-induced miR-9 up-regulation,
ruling out the involvement of any LPS-induced endogenous
mediator.
In the human genome, 3 distinct genes encode different
pri-miR-9 leading to the generation of identical mature miR-9.
Notwithstanding, quantitative analysis of the levels of expression
of each pri-miR-9 demonstrated that miR-9 accumulation in
response to LPS entirely derived from the pri-miR-9–1. A
detailed analysis of EST database revealed the existence in the
C1orf61 locus of 2 transcriptional units regulated by independent
promoters. Both transcriptional units were activated by LPS, and
inspection of the upstream promoter regions of miR-9–1, together with the analysis of miR-9 induction in the presence of
different signaling pathway inhibitors, showed that NF-␬B activation is involved in the induction of this miRNA.
One model for miRNA-based regulation of gene expression
envisages a global effect on the cell transcriptome mediated by

a direct effect of the miRNA on a large number of target
transcripts, which are diminished to negligible levels. In agreement with this model, an overrepresentation of the seeds of
miRNAs induced in a defined experimental condition in the
3⬘-UTR of genes down-regulated in the same condition has been
demonstrated, as in the case of the miR-155 seed in LPS-downregulated genes (26). An alternative mechanism, also sustained
by the frequent observation of a complex cross-talk between
miRNAs and transcription factors (19, 22, 24, 26), foresees an
indirect effect of miRNAs on the cell transcriptome mediated by
the control of transcripts encoding for key transcription regulators. As this mechanism has also been previously reported for
miR-9 (30, 31), among predicted miR-9 targets we focused our
attention on genes directly involved in the control of transcription under inflammatory conditions. Cotransfection experiments of miR-9 with 3⬘UTR luciferase reporters identified
NFKB1 as miR-9 target. Interestingly, the nfkb1 gene encodes 2
functional proteins (p50 and its precursor p105) with distinct
biological activities during LPS responses (33). The active nfkb1
gene product (p50) can form heterodimers with other NF-␬B
subunits, which function as transcriptional activators. Alternatively, p50 can form homodimers that have been shown to fulfill
an anti-inflammatory role by attenuating transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and by activating IL-10 expression (34,
35). Notably, the relative amount of each of the NF-␬B family
members may affect the outcome of the innate immune response
(34, 35). Unbalanced expression of p50 has been observed under
pathological conditions in which negative pathways of regulation
prevail such as LPS tolerance, chronic inflammatory conditions,
and cancer (36, 37). Analysis of the endogenous levels of this
miR-9 target showed that NFKB1 mRNA rapidly and transiently
increased during the initial hours of the LPS response, while the
NFKB1/p105 protein levels remained constant for up to 24 h.
This behavior perfectly fits the ‘‘micromanaging model,’’ according to which miRNAs contribute to maintain the optimal
level of expression of some genes, particularly regulatory genes,
that might have a narrow window of optimal expression (20).
Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that miR-9overexpressing monocytes display decreased NFKB1/p105 levels. Conversely, variations in NFKB1/p105 expression were not
observed after transfecting miR-155, indicating that this effect is
specific for miR-9. Since NF-␬B is a key regulator of inflammation, the NFKB1 levels are likely to be a strictly controlled and
timely regulated event of relevance for the proper progression of
the inflammatory response. On the basis of our observations it
is tempting to propose a model in which the parallel NF-␬Bdependent induction of NFKB1 and miR-9 provides a mean to
smooth out the fluctuations in gene expression and fine tune the
synthesis of this key transcription factor, thus allowing the
proinflammatory phase of the LPS response to correctly proceed. It will be important to assess how pathological conditions
in which regulatory circuits of inflammation prevail, such as the
systemic anti-inflammatory response syndrome associated with
LPS tolerance and cancer, affect the miR-9 regulatory axis.
In summary, the results reported here extend to freshly
isolated human monocytes and PMN previous observations on
the induction of miRNAs by LPS in mouse macrophages and cell
lines. In addition to the classic miR-155 and miR-146, a new set
of miRNAs (miR-9, miR-187, miR-125a, miR-99b, and let-7e)
were found to be LPS-responsive miRNAs in human monocytes.
Among these, only miR-9 was also induced in neutrophils.
Induction of miR-9 was also mediated by the proinflammatory
cytokines IL-1␤ and TNF-␣, but not by IFN␥. Interestingly,
NFKB1/p105/p50 was identified in silico and experimentally as
a miR-9 target. Given the regulatory function of p50 homodimers these results suggest a model whereby induction of
miR-9 acts a tuning mechanism to prevent negative regulation by

Northern Blot. Small RNA fraction was purified from PMN and monocytes and
processed for Northern blot analysis as described (39) and detailed in SI
Materials and Methods.

Materials and Methods

Cell Purification and Culture. Human PMN and monocytes were purified and
cultured as described in SI Materials and Methods. The HEK293 cell line was
grown in DMEM (Cambrex) supplemented with 10% FCS (Euroclone), 100 U/ml
penicillin/streptomycin (Cambrex), and 2 mM L-glutammine (Cambrex).
Quantification of miRNAs Expression Level. PMN and monocytes were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 8 h and the RNA fraction that is highly enriched
for small RNA species (ⱕ 200 bp) was isolated by using the mirVana isolation
kit (Ambion, Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The small RNA fractions were reverse transcribed and the analysis of the
expression level of 365 miRNA was performed using a TaqMan-based Low
Density Array. Details on reverse transcription as well as TaqMan Array are
presented in SI Materials and Methods. Experimental data were then analyzed by SDS2.2.2 software and the relative miRNA expression values were
calculated using RNU44 as endogenous control (38). miRNAs with a threshold
cycle ⬍33 that showed a fold change ⬎2 or ⬍0.5 in samples treated with LPS
as compared to control samples were considered as differentially expressed.

Constructs Generation and Luciferase Reporter Assay. Generation of miR-9-,
miR-155-encoding vectors, luc-fos, luc-NFKB1 and luc-mut-NFKB1 together
with the luciferase reporter assay are described in SI Materials and Methods.
The oligonucleotides used to generate the constructs are listed in Table S1.
Monocytes Transfection. Freshly purified monocytes (6 ⫻ 106) were transfected
with 5 ␮g of plasmid DNA (pcDNA3 empty vector, pcDNA3-miR-155, or
pcDNA3-miR-9) using the Amaxa Nuclofector and the Human Monocyte
Nucleofector kit (Amaxa), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells
were then cultured and processed as detailed in SI Materials and Methods.
Western Blot. Preparation of cell lysates and Western blot analysis were
conducted as previously described (40) and described in details in SI Materials
and Methods.
Statistical Analysis. Data are expressed as means ⫾ SD. Statistical changes in
luciferase expression were determined using the one-way ANOVA with ␣ set
to 0.05 according to the Newman-Keuls test.

Real Time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). miRNAs differentially expressed were validated
using individual TaqMan miRNA Assay (Applied Biosystems) as described in
details in SI Materials and Methods. The expression of miR-9 precursors
(pri-miR-9 –1, pri-miR-9 –2 and pri-miR-9 –3), CROC-4a, CROC-4b and NFKB1
was quantified by RT-qPCR (see SI Materials and Methods for details). The
primers and probes used are described in Table S1.
