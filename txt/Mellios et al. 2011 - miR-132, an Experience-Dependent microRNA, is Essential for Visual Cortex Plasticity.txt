Using quantitative analyses, we identified microRNAs (miRNAs)
that were abundantly expressed in visual cortex and that
responded to dark rearing and/or monocular deprivation. The
most substantially altered miRNA, miR-132, was rapidly
upregulated after eye opening and was delayed by dark rearing.
In vivo inhibition of miR-132 in mice prevented ocular dominance
plasticity in identified neurons following monocular deprivation
and affected the maturation of dendritic spines, demonstrating its
critical role in the plasticity of visual cortex circuits.
miRNAs are small, noncoding RNAs that are known to orchestrate the
expression of protein-coding genes1. They are particularly enriched in
the nervous system and have been shown to influence neuronal development and function2–4. However, little is known about their role in
experience-dependent cortical plasticity. We used molecular analyses
to examine changes in the expression of miRNAs in the primary visual
cortex (V1) of mice that were visually deprived5,6, either by dark rearing, with complete absence of light from birth, or by monocular deprivation, with suture of one eyelid during the critical period of heightened
ocular dominance plasticity7. The expression of a subset of miRNAs was
substantially altered by visual deprivation. Using structural and functional analyses, we found that the most robustly experience-dependent
miRNA, miR-132, is a crucial regulator of visual cortex plasticity.
To screen for miRNAs that respond to visual deprivation, we compared their expression in RNA extracted from V1 of three groups of
mice that were age-matched to the peak of the critical period5: postnatal day 28 (P28) control mice reared with a normal light/dark cycle,
P28 mice reared in darkness from birth, and P28 monocularly deprived
mice, reared with their eyelid sutured from P24–28 (Supplementary
Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1). All animal experiments were
approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Statistical analysis of microarray data8
revealed 21 differentially expressed miRNAs, the majority of which
were affected in a similar manner by dark rearing and monocular
deprivation (Supplementary Figs. 1–3 and Supplementary Table 1).

related (P < 0.0001) (Supplementary Fig. 4a). qRT-PCR confirmed the
altered expression of nine miRNAs, with decreases in miR-132, miR212 and miR-690 and increases in miR-497 and miR-551b expression
being observed after both dark rearing (miR-132, P < 0.0001; miR-212,
P = 0.0010; miR-690, P = 0.0245; miR-497, P = 0.0432; miR-551b,
P = 0.0489) and monocular deprivation (miR-132, P = 0.0004;
miR-212, P = 0.0139; miR-690, P = 0.0245; miR-497, P = 0.0337; miR-551b,
P = 0.0264) (Fig. 1a). Expression of two control brain-enriched miRNAs
(miR-124a and miR-125b) was unaffected, consistent with our micro­array
results (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, no significant changes (P > 0.10) were
observed in the ipsilateral V1 areas of monocular deprivation–altered
miRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 4b). In addition, qRT-PCR of primary
miRNA precursors (pri-miRNAs) indicated that their changes mirrored those of six out of nine mature miRNAs, which is suggestive of a
transcriptional mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 5). We also combined
in silico miRNA target prediction and pathway analysis and found that
multiple pathways linked to synaptic plasticity were predicted to be
highly targeted by experience-dependent miRNAs (Supplementary
Tables 2 and 3). Thus, our microarray and qRT-PCR analyses revealed
a set of miRNAs in V1 that are reliably regulated by visual experience
and are predicted to target plasticity-related molecular pathways.
Focusing on the most highly affected miRNA, miR-132, we found,
using qRT-PCR, that it was robustly increased after eye opening and
through the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity, and that
its diminished expression after dark rearing was gradually ­normalized
after light exposure (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, using locked nucleic acid
(LNA) in situ hybridization, we found that expression of miR-132 was
reduced in cortical layers 2–4 of V1 after both dark ­rearing and monocular deprivation (Fig. 1c,d and Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7), which
are sites of rapid ocular dominance ­plasticity9. Given these observations, we reasoned that miR-132 is well ­positioned to orchestrate the
molecular components of experience-dependent plasticity in V1.
To manipulate miR-132 function in vivo, we injected wild-type
or GFP-S mice with a mCherry–miR-132 competitive inhibitor
(sponge)–expressing lentivirus that predominantly infects neurons and
results in specific ‘sequestering’ of endogenous miR-132 (refs. 4,10)
(Supplementary Fig. 8). We then measured the expression of
p250GAP, a GTPase that is targeted by miR-132 and is known to
affect spine growth and morphology11–13, and examined ­structural
changes in transfected pyramidal neurons at P28. We found increased
p250GAP in mCherry–miR-132 sponge–expressing pyramidal

significant reduction in mEPSC amplitude in sponge-infected neurons
(P = 0.0385) (Fig. 2j). These effects of miR-132 inhibition are consistent with delayed synaptic maturation of pyramidal V1 neurons.
To directly examine the influence of miR-132 on ocular dominance plasticity, we used two-photon calcium imaging to measure the
strength of neuronal responses to contralateral and ipsilateral eye stimulation in the binocular area of V1, contralateral to the deprived eye,
following neonatal injection of mCherry–miR-132 sponge–expressing
virus (Fig. 3a). The relative strength of contralateral eye– and ipsilateral eye–driven responses was quantified by calculating the ocular
dominance index (ODI) for each neuron (Fig. 3b). We found that
in vivo miR-132 inhibition disrupted the ocular dominance shift that
was normally present after 4 d of monocular deprivation (Fig. 3c,d).
Analysis of eye-specific responses revealed that the observed blockade
of plasticity was mainly due to prevention of monocular deprivation

remaining normal after both P5 and P16 injections (Fig. 2a–h and

spines (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Fig. 9i), mainly by reducing the
percentage of mushroom spines and increasing the proportion of
immature filopodia (Supplementary Fig. 9j). We assayed for accompanying physiological synaptic changes in sponge-infected neurons
by measuring AMPA receptor–dependent spontaneous miniature
excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), using whole-cell recordings from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (Fig. 2j and Supplementary
Fig. 10). We found no change in mEPSC frequency, but there was a

Top right, confocal microscopy images showing mCherry expression in cortical layers 1–3 at P28 following neonatal injection (arrow) of mCherry–miR-132
sponge–expressing lentivirus. Bottom, two-photon microscopy image showing mCherry expression alone (left) and its overlay with OGB (green)
fluorescence (right) in an injected mouse that underwent monocular deprivation; selected neurons used in b are circled and numbered. Scale bars
represent 40 µm. (b) Example of contralateral eye– and ipsilateral eye–driven calcium responses of the neurons shown in a that express high (neuron 1)
or low (neuron 2) levels of mCherry–miR-132 sponge. Pink shaded area indicates period with visual stimulus. Calculated ODIs were 0.73 (neuron 1)
and 0.55 (neuron 2). (c) ODI values (ODI = (contralateral – ipsilateral) / (contralateral + ipsilateral); mean ± s.e.m.) derived from peak visual responses
obtained by two-photon calcium imaging in mice injected with mCherry–miR-132 sponge–expressing lentivirus. Black bars indicate mice subjected
to 4 d of monocular deprivation and light gray bars indicate mice that were not subjected to monocular deprivation (miR-132 sponge non–monocular
deprivation, five mice, 290 neurons; miR-132 sponge monocular deprivation, four mice, 232 neurons; control non–monocular deprivation; three
mice, 120 neurons; control monocular deprivation, three mice, 177 neurons). The ODI did not shift following monocular deprivation in mice that were
injected with miR-132 sponge, but not control, virus. A significantly larger ocular dominance shift was seen in control monocularly deprived mice than
in any of the other conditions (**P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney test comparing neurons; P < 0.05 treating each mouse as a single datum). (d) Cumulative
histogram of ODI data shown in c. There was a significant difference between control monocular deprivation and non–monocular deprivation neurons
(black and light gray dashed lines, respectively), but not between miR-132 sponge–infected monocular deprivation and non–monocular deprivation
neurons (black and light gray lines, respectively) (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).

effects on contralateral responses (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12).
As expected, neurons that were transfected with the control virus (containing mCherry without the miR-132 sponge sequence) did show
a shift in ocular dominance toward the undeprived eye (Fig. 3c,d).
Notably, neurons expressing low levels of miR-132 sponge (as judged by
mCherry load) that were present in the proximity of neurons expressing higher levels displayed a shift in their ODI that was comparable
to that of control mono­cularly deprived animals (Supplementary
Fig. 13a–d), as did uninfected neurons that were located adjacent to
sponge-infected ones (Supplementary Fig. 13e), suggesting a potential threshold for the degree of miR-132 inhibition needed to abrogate
ocular dominance plasticity. Thus, miR-132 expression in V1 neurons
is essential for plasticity of their responses and underlying circuits.
Ocular dominance plasticity following monocular deprivation during the critical period leads to coordinated changes in the functional
responses of neurons and structural properties of spines7,14,15. Given
that miR-132 is upregulated after eye opening in a time window that
parallels the critical period and that dark rearing prevents this upregulation, we hypothesize that light-induced, and thus activity-induced,
elevation of miR-132 expression is crucial for the initiation of ocular
dominance plasticity. Indeed, sequestering miR-132 levels before eye
opening and extending through the critical period prevented both
monocular deprivation–induced functional plasticity and structural
maturation of spines. The failure of miR-132 sponge–expressing neurons to exhibit ocular dominance plasticity at P28 likely reflects a shift
of the critical period to a later age, effectively by maintaining the cortex
in a earlier developmental stage (see also Supplementary Discussion).
We conclude that experience-dependent upregulation of miR-132 contributes fundamentally to the sensitive period of cortical plasticity.
