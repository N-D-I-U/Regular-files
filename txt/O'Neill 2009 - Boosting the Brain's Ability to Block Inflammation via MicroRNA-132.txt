The brain-immune axis continues to fascinate. In this issue of Immunity, Shaked et al. (2009) describe how
miR-132 mediates an anti-inflammatory effect via the targeting of acetylcholinesterase, leading to an
increase in the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as
yet another determining set of regulators
of immunity and inflammation. They have
roles in B cell development, T cell polarization, and macrophage function on a
par with that of cytokines (Sheedy and
O’Neill, 2008). miRNAs bind to mRNA
targets via sequence complementarity
and either repress translation or cause
degradation of the mRNA (Ambros, 2004).
Overall, therefore, their role is to downregulate responses. This can have an
inhibitory effect, if the target is required
for the response, or a stimulatory effect,
if the target is an inhibitor. Among the
best characterized in innate immunity
are miR-146a, which targets the signaling
molecule Traf6 and thereby limits Toll-like
receptor signaling (Taganov et al., 2006),
and miR-155, which targets the lipid
phosphatase SHIP1 (O’Connell et al.,
2009), an important signal for macrophage activation. miR-155-deficient mice
have a profound immune phenotype
because of enhanced T helper 2 (Th2)
cell responses (Rodriguez et al., 2007).
The mechanism here appears to be the
ability of miR-155 to additionally target
the 30 UTR in the mRNA encoding c-Maf.
The miR-155-deficient mouse therefore
has elevated c-Maf, leading to overproduction of the cytokine IL-4 and the
enhanced Th2 cellular response. In this
issue of Immunity, Shaked et al. (2009)
provide evidence that miR-132 has antiinflammatory effects via the targeting
of the mRNA encoding acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (Shaked et al., 2009). This
enzyme limits the level of acetylcholine
(ACh), an important inhibitor of peripheral
inflammation, and one of the better-characterized mediators of the neuroimmune
axis (Sternberg, 2006). By targeting the
mRNA encoding AChE, an increase in

ACh occurs, leading to an anti-inflammatory effect. miR-132 is therefore acting
as an inhibitor of an enzyme that blocks
an inhibitor of inflammation. The net result
is decreased inflammation, with miR-132
acting as an important regulator of the
brain-to-body resolution of the inflammatory response.
The study began with a demonstration
that treatment of murine splenocytes
with the TLR4 ligand LPS led to a downregulation of AChE. A decrease in serum
AChE was also observed upon injection
of LPS intraperitoneally. The authors
explored whether miRNAs might be
involved in the downregulation of AChE
and found that two miRNAs known to
be induced by LPS—miR-132 and the
miR-182 subtype miR-182*—had complimentary sites in the 30 UTR of the mRNA
for AChE. Mice were then injected with
an antisense oligonucleotide that targets miR-132. This treatment led to an
increase in AChE protein expression
in vivo, indicating that miR-132 is a major
systemic regulator of AChE. The opposite
approach of overexpressing miR-132
downregulated AChE activity, confirming
that miR-132 can regulate AChE expression.
The authors then tested a transgenic
mouse that had an AChE gene lacking
the miR-132 target sequence. Intestinal
explants from the mice had elevated
AChE activity and protein expression, in
spite of robust amounts of miR-132. The
mice also had higher basal amounts of
IL-1b and IL6 in their circulation. AChE
expression in the intestine from the
transgenic mice reached similar amounts
as those in the anti-132-treated mice.
Furthermore, injection of the mice with
LPS led to a hyperthermia, and macrophages from the mice overproduced the

cytokines IL-6, IL-12, and TNF when challenged with LPS. The mice also displayed
increased leukocyte recruitment in the
peritoneum after thioglycolate injection.
The excessive inflammatory response in
the mice could be overcome by nicotine,
which is not metabolized by AChE. This
study therefore indicates that AChE is
under the control of miR-132. The targeting of AChE by miR-132 leads to an elevation in the anti-inflammatory neuromodulator ACh, the net effect of miR-132
being the suppression of inflammation
via inhibition of AChE production, as
shown in Figure 1.
This study emphasizes the importance
of ACh in the control of inflammation and
of miRNA—miR-132—in promoting this
anti-inflammatory effect. The mechanism
here is the targeting of the ACh-metabolizing enzyme AChE via a decrease in
mRNA translation mediated by miR-132,
which has a net anti-inflammatory effect
via the stabilizing of ACh amounts. This
process is likely to be important for the
brain’s ability to control inflammation via
cholinergic signaling. Activation of this
‘‘cholinergic’’ reflex inhibits inflammation,
although precisely how the reflex is triggered is not known. Early in an inflammatory response, AChE expression will be
high, and this in turn will limit ACh and
thereby promote inflammation. From this
study, we can infer that miR-132 expression will rise in response to inflammatory
stimuli such as LPS. This in turn will inhibit
the production of AChE, allowing ACh
expression to rise and exert anti-inflammatory effects, in a classic negative-feedback loop. miR-132 expression may in
fact be the key promoter of the antiinflammatory effect of ACh.
Might this process be amenable
to therapeutic manipulation? Several

approaches are currently being investigated that might modulate miRNA
amounts or affect their targets. If the
effect of miR-132 on AChE were to be
blocked, a decrease in ACh would be
expected, which would have a proinflammatory effect. This could be useful in
vaccine adjuvancy in infectious diseases
or in cancer. On the other hand, if miR132 were to be enhanced, this would
lead to an increase in ACh, which in turn
would have an anti-inflammatory effect.
The observation of the role of miR-132
here adds to a growing and important
literature on the control of immunity and
inflammation by miRNAs. Further analyses are required to determine the
importance of miR-132 in human inflammatory diseases and whether this neuroimmune axis might lend itself to therapeutic targeting.

Figure 1. Targeting of Acetylcholinesterase by miR-132 Limits Inflammation
Top: Stimuli such as LPS promote inflammation via the induction of cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF via
TLR signaling. Acetylcholine (ACh) from the vagus nerve can block this response. The enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) controls the amount of ACh, allowing inflammation to proceed. Bottom: LPS also
induces miR-132, which targets the mRNA encoding AChE, leading to decreased production of the
enzyme. This in turn leads to an elevation in ACh, which has an anti-inflammatory effect.
