MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that control the translation of target messenger RNAs, thereby regulating
critical aspects of plant and animal development. In the mammalian nervous system, the spatiotemporal control of
mRNA translation has an important role in synaptic development and plasticity. Although a number of microRNAs have
been isolated from the mammalian brain, neither the specific microRNAs that regulate synapse function nor their target
mRNAs have been identified. Here we show that a brain-specific microRNA, miR-134, is localized to the synaptodendritic compartment of rat hippocampal neurons and negatively regulates the size of dendritic spines—postsynaptic
sites of excitatory synaptic transmission. This effect is mediated by miR-134 inhibition of the translation of an mRNA
encoding a protein kinase, Limk1, that controls spine development. Exposure of neurons to extracellular stimuli such as
brain-derived neurotrophic factor relieves miR-134 inhibition of Limk1 translation and in this way may contribute to
synaptic development, maturation and/or plasticity.
Highly orchestrated programmes of gene expression act to shape the
developing nervous system. This tight regulation is mediated by a
variety of transcriptional and post-transcriptional events that control
the expression of individual gene products1,2. The discovery of small,
non-coding RNAs has greatly expanded our understanding of the
cellular mechanisms that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act by binding to target
mRNAs and initiating either cleavage or a reduction in the translational efficiency of the target mRNA, depending on the degree
of sequence complementarity3–5. Biochemical and genetic studies
have revealed important functions for specific miRNAs in a variety
of cellular processes, including differentiation, apoptosis and
metabolism6–10.
A number of miRNAs have been isolated from the vertebrate
nervous system11–13, and a recent study has demonstrated a crucial
role for the miRNA pathway in early zebrafish brain development14.
Expression analysis also supports a role for miRNAs in later stages of
neuronal maturation and synapse development12,15,16. A potential
role for miRNAs in synaptic function is particularly intriguing given
the evidence that selected mRNAs in neurons are transported to sites
of synaptic contact that are quite distant from the cell body17–19.
Within dendrites, and at synapses, the translation of these mRNAs
may be inhibited until neurons are exposed to appropriate extracellular stimuli such as a neurotrophic factor (for example, brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)) or neurotransmitter release at
the synapse. Local translation of these previously dormant mRNAs
has been hypothesized to have a key role in synaptic development and
plasticity20–22. Whether miRNAs might inhibit the translation of
synaptically localized mRNAs in neurons until their translation is
activated by neurotrophic factors or neuronal activity remains to be
investigated.
miR-134 expression during synapse development
To identify miRNAs that might function in dendritic and/or synaptic
development, we investigated the expression and localization of

candidate miRNAs that had been previously isolated from mouse
brain13. Both northern blotting and an RNase protection assay (RPA)
revealed that the expression of microRNA-134 (miR-134) is
restricted to the brain, similar to the expression pattern of the
previously characterized miR-124a (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig.
1a, b). Unlike miR-124a, however, miR-134 levels in the hippocampus gradually increase with development, reaching maximum
levels at postnatal day 13 (P13), the time at which synaptic maturation occurs (Fig. 1b). A similar developmental expression profile
was also observed in dissociated hippocampal neurons that were
allowed to mature over time in culture (Fig. 1c). Moreover, membrane depolarization of cortical neurons induced a significant
increase in the level of the miR-134 precursor (Supplementary Fig.
1c). Taken together, these results suggested a potential role for miR134 in dendritic and/or synaptic development.
We used an in situ hybridization (ISH) protocol to examine the
subcellular localization of the miR-134 RNA within cultured hippocampal neurons. Unlike the mismatch control probe, hybridization
with the miR-134-specific probe revealed the presence of miR-134
within dendrites, where it is present in a punctate pattern (Fig. 1d and
Supplementary Fig. 1d). Quantification of the two signal intensities
(miR-134-specific versus the mismatch probe) along the length of
multiple dendrites confirmed significantly higher levels of miR-134specific signal within dendrites as compared to that obtained with the
mismatch control (Supplementary Fig. 1e) or the U6 small nuclear
(sn)RNA (data not shown). A substantial fraction of the dendritic miR134 was found to partially co-localize with synapsin immunostaining,
indicating that miR-134 is present near synaptic sites on dendrites
(Fig. 1d, lower panel and inset at higher magnification). The presence
of miR-134 in synaptic compartments was also corroborated by
subcellular fractionation experiments; miR-134 was enriched in synaptoneurosome preparations (Fig. 1e), which represent membrane
preparations highly enriched for synaptic terminals23. The presence of
miR-134 within dendrites near synapses suggested a possible functional role for this miRNA at post-synaptic sites.

miR-134 regulates dendritic spine morphology
To investigate a possible function of miR-134 at the synapse, we
examined the effects of modulating miR-134 activity on dendritic
spine development. Dendritic spines are actin-rich protrusions from
the dendritic shaft and represent the major sites of excitatory synaptic
contact24,25. The size of dendritic spines is a good correlate of the
strength of excitatory synapses26–28. To achieve miR-134 overexpression, we designed a vector that permits efficient expression of
exogenous miR-134 (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Alternatively, miR134 function in neurons was suppressed by introducing a 2 0 -Omethylated antisense oligonucleotide that interferes with endogenous miR-134 activity in a sequence-specific manner29,30. The efficacy
of these approaches was confirmed in neurons using a previously
described miRNA sensor assay (Supplementary Fig. 2b)31.
An analysis of dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons
(cultured for a total of 18 days, transfected at day 8: 8 þ 10 days
in vitro (DIV)) overexpressing miR-134 showed a significantly
decreased spine volume as compared to the spines of neurons
transfected with empty vector or overexpressing the unrelated let7c miRNA (Fig. 2a (bottom panel), b (bottom panel), e and
Supplementary Fig. 3a–c).
Further analysis revealed that this decrease in spine volume was
mainly a consequence of a reduction in spine width (216.9 ^ 5.8%,
n ¼ 3, P ¼ 0.02) as opposed to a change in spine length
(23.5 ^ 7.1%, n ¼ 3, P ¼ 0.23, Fig. 2f). A similar reduction in

dendritic spine size was observed when synthetic miR-134 was
introduced into neurons at a later stage (15 DIV) and for shorter
times (72 h, Supplementary Fig. 3d). Because hippocampal neurons
at 15 DIV have already developed the vast majority of their spines,
these findings suggest that miR-134 may perturb the morphology of
pre-existing spines.
In contrast to the effect of miR-134 overexpression, sequencespecific inhibition of endogenous miR-134 function using a 2 0 -Omethylated antisense oligonucleotide29,30 (2 0 -O-Me-134) led to small
but statistically significant increases in spine volume and width
(7.6 ^ 3.7%, n ¼ 3, P ¼ 0.03) when compared to neurons transfected with an unrelated 2 0 -O-Me-control oligonucleotide (Fig. 2c
(bottom panel), d (bottom panel), e, f). No significant effects on
spine length were observed in the presence of 2 0 -O-Me-134
(2.6 ^ 5.6%, n ¼ 3, P ¼ 0.25). Neither miR-134 overexpression
nor the use of 2 0 -O-methylated oligonucleotides had any measurable
effect on spine density or overall dendritic complexity (Supplementary Fig. 3e, f). We conclude that miR-134 acts as a negative regulator
of dendritic spine volume in hippocampal neurons, raising the
possibility that miR-134 may be involved in the regulation of synapse
development and/or function.
miR-134 inhibits translation of Limk1 mRNA
To gain insight into the mechanisms by which miR-134 regulates
dendritic spine morphology, we sought to identify miR-134 target
mRNAs. Towards this end, we scanned the 3 0 untranslated regions
(UTRs) of mRNAs for potential miR-134 binding sites. For this
analysis, we focused on a set of 48 genes that we recently identified in
a screen for mRNAs for which translation is enhanced in neurons
upon treatment with BDNF32. As BDNF promotes dendritic spine
growth33 and regulates synaptic function, at least in part, by activating dendritic protein synthesis21, we reasoned that mRNAs for which
translation is regulated by BDNF might also represent miR-134
targets. Three of the BDNF-regulated mRNAs (discs large homologue 2 (DLG2), Neurod2 and Lim-domain-containing protein kinase
1 (Limk1)) were found to contain conserved 3 0 UTR sequence
elements that were partially complementary to mouse miR-134
(Fig. 3a and data not shown). Among these potential miR-134 target
mRNAs, Limk1 was of particular interest. Limk1 regulates actin
filament dynamics through inhibition of ADF/cofilin34, and Limk1
knockout mice show abnormalities in dendritic spine structure
similar to those observed upon miR-134 overexpression35.
Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we demonstrated
that Limk1 mRNA and miR-134 interact in vitro (Supplementary
Fig. 4). We next determined whether the Limk1 mRNA co-localized
with miR-134 within dendrites of live neurons. Fluorescently labelled
miR-134 was introduced into hippocampal neurons by micro-injection together with a fluorescent Limk1 3 0 UTR that contains the miR134 binding site. Both miR-134 and the Limk1 3 0 UTR, in contrast to
the non-dendritic Gapdh and histone H3 mRNAs, were found to be
present within dendrites in a granular pattern (Fig. 3b, upper two
panels and data not shown). Moreover, miR-134- and Limk1 3 0
UTR-positive granules were co-localized within dendrites (Fig. 3b,
lower panel). Furthermore, efficient co-localization of miR-134 and
Limk1 mRNA required the presence of an intact miR-134 binding site
within the Limk1 3 0 UTR (Fig. 3b, bar graph). The dendritic
localization of endogenous Limk1 mRNA was further confirmed
by ISH in cultured neurons and by subcellular fractionation
(Supplementary Fig. 5a, b).
In mammalian cells, miRNAs are thought to regulate the
expression of target mRNAs predominantly through the inhibition
of productive translation3. We therefore hypothesized that miR-134
binding to the Limk1 mRNA might act to inhibit Limk1 translation.
In support of this idea, miR-134 overexpression in both 293T cells
and primary neurons was found to decrease specifically the activity of
a luciferase reporter gene fused to the wild-type Limk1 3 0 UTR,
whereas expression of the unrelated let-7c miRNA had no significant

effect on the expression of this reporter construct (Fig. 4a and
Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). The steady-state levels of the reporter
gene mRNA were unaffected by miR-134 overexpression, suggesting
that the observed effect of miR-134 on luciferase expression does not
reflect a change in the stability of the luciferase mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 6c). The effect of miR-134 on translation of the luciferase
mRNA is dependent on the presence of the miR-134 cognate binding
site within the 3 0 UTR, as expression of a luciferase reporter containing the mutant m191 Limk1 3 0 UTR (that is, with a mutated miR-134
binding site) was unaffected by the presence of exogenous miR-134
(Fig. 4a, white bars). In contrast to the effect on Limk1 mRNA
translation, mutation of the miR-134 binding site did not affect
dendritic targeting of a Gfp–Limk1 reporter RNA (Supplementary
Fig. 5c).
The inhibition of endogenous miR-134 in neurons by 2 0 -O-Me134 led to a statistically significant increase in the expression of the
luciferase reporter fused to the wild-type Limk1 3 0 UTR (Fig. 4b,
black bars), but had no significant effect on expression of the m191
mutant reporter that is incapable of binding miR-134 (Fig. 4b, white
bars). By contrast, an antisense oligonucleotide directed against let7c (2 0 -O-Me-let-7c) had no effect on Limk1 reporter gene activity.
Peptide-mediated delivery of miR-134 into neurons led to a dosedependent decrease in the level of endogenous Limk1 protein,
whereas delivery of its inhibitor 2 0 -O-Me-134 led to an increase in
protein level (Fig. 4c, d), suggesting that miR-134 inhibits translation
of the endogenous Limk1 mRNA. Taken together, these data suggest
that endogenous miR-134 inhibits Limk1 mRNA translation in
neurons by binding to a single site present in the Limk1 3 0 UTR.
Although these studies provide evidence that miR-134 acts to
repress Limk1 mRNA translation, they do not distinguish whether
the inhibition occurs within the cell body and/or dendrites. To
address this issue, we generated a GFP-based protein synthesis
reporter (myr-d1Gfp) with limited diffusion and a shortened halflife (1 h). Results from a previous study using a similar construct

demonstrated that GFP expressed from the reporter gene allows for
the study of local protein synthesis within intact dendrites36. The
myr-d1GFP reporter was fused to either wild-type or m191 mutant
Limk1 3 0 UTR and introduced into hippocampal neurons. GFP
expression was monitored by confocal microscopy, and the intensity
of the GFP signal was determined in the dendrites of many neurons at
varying distances from the cell body (Fig. 4e). This analysis revealed
that the average expression of the wild-type Limk1 reporter was
significantly reduced (by 18–28%) along the entire length of the
dendrites compared to that of the m191 reporter (Fig. 4f). Given the
dendritic localization of endogenous Limk1 mRNA and miR-134,
these findings suggest that miR-134 partially inhibits Limk1 mRNA
translation locally within dendrites.
miR-134 regulates spine size through Limk1
Because both overexpression of miR-134 and disruption of Limk1
function lead to decreased spine size35, we next investigated whether
miR-134-mediated repression of Limk1 mRNA translation might be
an explanation for the observed reduction in dendritic spine size
upon miR-134 overexpression. Towards this end, we expressed miR134 in hippocampal neurons together with constructs expressing
either a wild-type Limk1 mRNA or mutant m191 Limk1 mRNA, and
monitored dendritic spine size (Fig. 5a). We reasoned that if the effect
of miR-134 on spine morphology occurs through suppression of
endogenous Limk1 mRNA translation, ectopically expressed Limk1
mRNA that is incapable of interacting with miR-134 (m191) should
be able to rescue the spine defect. In contrast, co-expression of the
wild-type Limk1 mRNA, which is still subject to miR-134-mediated
translational inhibition, might be expected to prove less effective in
the rescue of the dendritic spine phenotype caused by miR-134

overexpression. Consistent with this idea, we found that the m191
mutant Limk1 mRNA efficiently rescued both the spine volume and
width decrease imposed by miR-134 overexpression, whereas the
wild-type Limk1 mRNA was not as effective at rescuing the decrease
in spine volume and width (Fig. 5a, upper and lower left panels).
Both Limk1 constructs had no effect on dendritic spine length (Fig.
5a, lower right). In addition, the observed difference between the
effect of the wild-type and m191 mutant Limk1 mRNA on spine
width was not due to intrinsic differences in the ability of the two
mRNAs to be translated, because in the absence of miR-134, Limk1
protein levels were equivalent in 293Tcells transfected with the wildtype and mutant Limk1 constructs (Fig. 5b). Immunohistochemistry
revealed that in neurons, overexpressed Limk1 protein was targeted
to synaptic sites within spines (Fig. 5c), consistent with the possibility
that an increased level of Limk1 protein within spines might be
responsible for the rescue of the spine morphology phenotype. Taken
together, these results suggest that Limk1 is a downstream effector of
miR-134 in the control of dendritic spine development.
miR-134 functions in BDNF-stimulated Limk1 synthesis
Dendritic mRNAs are transported to the synapto-dendritic compartment within RNA granules. During their transport and once they
have arrived at synaptic sites, the translation of dendritic mRNAs
may be suppressed until extracellular factors such as those released
upon synaptic stimulation activate the translation of these dormant
mRNAs17,19. We asked whether the suppression of Limk1 translation
by miR-134 is relieved by extracellular stimuli such as BDNF. We first
assessed whether the translation of Limk1 mRNA is regulated by
BDNF. Towards this end, synaptoneurosomes prepared from P15 rat
brain were incubated with 35S-methionine to label newly synthesized

translation assay in hippocampal neurons (12 þ 2 DIV) using destabilized,
membrane-anchored myr-d1GFP reporter genes (green) harbouring

proteins, and the amount of newly synthesized Limk1 protein
was monitored by radio-immunoprecipitation. BDNF treatment
significantly increased synthesis of Limk1 protein within isolated
synaptoneurosomes as indicated by an increase in 35S-methioninelabelled protein in Limk1 immunoprecipitates. This increase was
sensitive to treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR
kinase pathway, which we and others have shown to mediate BDNF
signalling to the translational machinery (Fig. 6a)32,37.
We next asked whether the ability of BDNF to induce Limk1
mRNA translation reflects the ability of BDNF to relieve miR-134dependent repression of Limk1 translation. Towards this end, we
examined the effect of BDNF treatment on the translation of a Limk1
3 0 UTR luciferase reporter mRNA in neurons at a time when
endogenous miR-134 is highly expressed (14 DIV). When cells
were transfected with luciferase mRNA fused to the wild-type
Limk1 3 0 UTR, BDNF led to a statistically significant induction of

translation of the reporter mRNA (Fig. 6b). Expression of the m191
luciferase reporter mRNA was derepressed relative to the wild-type
reporter in the absence of BDNF treatment, presumably due to the
failure of endogenous miR-134 to bind to the m191 reporter gene
(Fig. 6b). BDNF treatment did not lead to a further increase in the
expression of the m191 reporter gene. To investigate the effect of
miR-134 on BDNF-induced Limk1 translation more directly, we
introduced synthetic miR-134 into neurons that express little
endogenous miR-134 (4 DIV, Fig. 1c). We found that miR-134
partially interferes with BDNF induction of the wild-type, but not
the m191 mutant, reporter mRNA (Fig. 6c). These findings suggest
that miR-134 represses Limk1 mRNA translation and that BDNF
treatment relieves this repression. However, the observation that
there is still residual BDNF induction of reporter mRNA translation

when miR-134 cannot bind to the Limk1 3 0 UTR suggests an
involvement of additional miR-134-independent mechanism(s) in
BDNF-induced Limk1 translation.
Discussion
We have identified a dendritically localized miRNA that regulates the
expression of the synaptic Limk1 protein, thereby controlling dendritic spine size. We hypothesize that the association of Limk1 mRNA
with miR-134 keeps the Limk1 mRNA in a dormant state while it is
being transported within dendrites to synaptic sites (Fig. 6d). In the
absence of synaptic activity, miR-134 may recruit a silencing complex
that has a key role in repressing Limk1 mRNA translation. This then
limits the synthesis of new Limk1 protein and restricts the growth of
dendritic spines. Upon synaptic stimulation, the release of BDNF
may trigger activation of the TrkB/mTOR signalling pathway, which
inactivates the miR-134-associated silencing complex by an as-yetunknown mechanism, leading to enhanced Limk1 protein synthesis
and spine growth. Our preliminary finding that miR-134 moves to
the polysome-associated mRNA pool upon BDNF stimulation (G.S.
and M.E.G., unpublished observations) suggests that miR-134 itself
may not dissociate from the Limk1 mRNA upon exposure of neurons
to BDNF. Instead, we speculate that BDNF alters the activity of other
translational regulators within the miR-134-containing complex. In
addition to miR-134, other neuronal miRNAs have been predicted to
bind the Limk1 3 0 UTR38. Therefore, the combinatorial action of
multiple miRNAs on the Limk1 3 0 UTR might explain our observation that miR-134 only partially inhibits Limk1 mRNA translation
(Fig. 4).
A recent bioinformatics approach predicted several additional
neuronal mRNAs that may also represent miR-134 targets39. Given
that BDNF has important roles at multiple steps of synaptic development40,41, it is possible that miR-134 regulates distinct sets of target
genes involved in the formation, maturation or plasticity of synapses.
We propose that miRNA regulation of the translation of a variety
of neuronal mRNAs will be found to contribute in an important way
to synaptic function42. It is tempting to speculate that miRNAs act
locally at individual synapses, thereby contributing to synapsespecific modifications that occur during synaptic plasticity. A future
challenge will be to identify the full complement of dendritic
miRNAs as well as their target mRNAs, and to determine their role
in synaptic development.
METHODS
DNA constructs. The rat Limk1 3 0 UTR (1,171 base pairs) was amplified by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from rat brain cDNA (P15). Mutation of the
miR-134 binding site (m191) was achieved using the Quick Change site directed
mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). PCR products were cloned into pGL3 basic
(Promega), pBSK (Stratagene) or myr-d1GFP (gift of B. Sabatini) for constructs
used in luciferase assay, in vitro transcription, or local reporter assay, respectively.
For Limk1 expression constructs, the Limk1 cDNA (gift of K. Mizuno) was
cloned into pcDNA3 (Promega) together with rat Limk1 3 0 UTR (wild type or
m191). For the miR-134 expression construct, a genomic sequence spanning
150 base pairs 3 0 and 5 0 of the miR-134 sequence (Supplementary Fig. S1c) was
PCR-amplified and cloned into pcDNA3. See Supplementary Information for
further details.
Cell culture, transfection and stimulation. Cultures of dissociated primary
cortical and hippocampal neurons were prepared as described32. Hippocampal
neurons were maintained in Neurobasal plus B27 supplement; cortical neurons
in Basal Medium Eagle plus 5% FBS. Neuronal transfections were performed
with LipofectAmine 2000 (Invitrogen). For BDNF stimulation, neurons were
starved overnight in the presence of UO126 (1 mM) and then treated with BDNF
(Preprotech, 100 ng ml21) for 4 h before cell harvest.
Northern blotting and RNase protection assays. RNA was isolated from
synaptoneurosomes or cultured neurons by phenol/chloroform extraction
using RNA Stat-60 (Tel-Test). For northern blots, 30 mg of total RNA was
resolved on 15% urea/polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond Nþ
membrane (Amersham). See Supplementary Information for further details.
RNase protection assays were performed with the mirVana miRNA detection kit
(Ambion) as per the manufacturers’ recommendations.

In situ hybridization. In situ hybridization of endogenous mRNAs and GFP
reporter mRNAs was as described32. For the detection of small RNAs, a
digoxigenin tail was added to antisense-locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligonucleotides (Exiqon) with the DIG tailing kit (Roche). Tailed LNA oligonucleotides
were purified and used for overnight hybridization at 42 8C. All other steps were
the same as for mRNAs.
Microinjection. Mature hippocampal neurons43 were microinjected using an
AIS2 microinjection system (Cellbiology Trading) attached to a Zeiss Axiovert
200M. Annealed 3 0 -end labelled (Alexa-546) sense and unmodified antisense
strands of miR-134 (IBA) were used at 100 ng ml21. Limk1 RNA was labelled by in
vitro transcription in the presence of Alexa-488-5 0 UTP (Molecular Probes) and
used at 200 ng ml21. Microinjection needles with a tip size between 0.2 and
0.3 mm were used (P-87, Sutter Instruments) with a holding pressure of 40 hPa
and an injection pressure of 80 hPa. Cells were imaged 20 min after injection, and
randomly selected images were analysed by three independent observers in a
blind manner.
Peptide-mediated delivery. Double-stranded small RNA or 2 0 -O-methylated
DNA oligonucleotides containing a 5 0 thiol group (80 mm, IDT) were reduced
with TCEP (80 mm, Sigma) at room temperature for 15 min. Penetratin (80 mm,
Qbiogene) was added and the mixture was incubated at 65 8C followed by 1 h at
37 8C. Coupled oligonucleotides were heated at 65 8C for 15 min before adding to
cells at the indicated concentrations for 4 h. Neurons were harvested for western
analysis 48 h after transduction.
Image analysis. For spine analysis, neurons were transfected at 8 DIV or 15 DIV
with indicated expression plasmids in combination with EGFP and processed for
confocal microscopy at 18 DIV. See Supplementary Information for further
details on spine analysis.
For Sholl analysis, a series of concentric circles of 10-mm increments was
manually drawn around the cell body, and the number of dendritic intersections
at each individual circle was counted. At least ten individual neurons were
measured for each experimental condition. To quantify dendritic GFP levels in
the local reporter assay, random dendrites were selected based on dsRed staining
and plot profiles of the GFP intensity of the same dendrites were derived using
ImageJ (NIH). The obtained values were background corrected and normalized
to the respective signal in the red channel. At least 20 dendrites per experimental
condition of a total of three independent experiments were measured.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a
Taq-Man (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) using the SYBR-green-containing PCR kit
(PE Applied Biosystems) as described32.
Preparation of synaptoneurosomes and radio-immunoprecipitation. Synaptoneurosomes were prepared from P15 long-Evans rat pups (Charles River)
as described32. For radio-immunoprecipitation, a mouse monoclonal antiLimk1 antibody (Pharmingen) was used.
Immunocytochemistry. Hippocampal neurons (18 DIV) were immunostained
as described32, using a mouse monoclonal anti-Limk1 (Pharmingen) or a rabbit
anti-synapsin (Chemicon) antibody as primary antibody.
Luciferase assay. Cortical neurons were transfected at 4 DIV or 12 DIV, and
luciferase assays were performed 2 days later with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega).
