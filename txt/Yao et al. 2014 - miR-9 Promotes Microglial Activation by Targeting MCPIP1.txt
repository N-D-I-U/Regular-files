Microglia participate in innate inﬂammatory responses within the central nervous system.
The highly conserved microRNA-9 (miR-9) plays critical roles in neurogenesis as well as
axonal extension. Its role in microglial inﬂammatory responses, however, remains poorly
understood. Here we identify a unique role of miR-9 in mediating the microglial inﬂammatory
response via distinct signalling pathways. MiR-9-mediated regulation of cellular activation
involved downregulated expression of the target protein, monocyte chemotactic proteininduced protein 1 (MCPIP1) that is crucial for controlling inﬂammation. Results indicate that
miR-9-mediated cellular activation involved signalling via the NF-kB pathway, but not the
b-catenin pathway.

icroglia, cells of the myeloid lineage in the central
nervous system (CNS), play an important role in
immune surveillance and are known to be actively
involved in various neurologic pathologies. Under normal CNS
homeostasis, microglia manifest a ramiﬁed phenotype with highly
branched, motile cell processes1,2. In response to pathological
stimuli, these cells undergo phenotypic changes, elicit
inﬂammatory responses and migrate towards the toxic stimuli.
Paradoxically, these cells while crucial for host defence, can also
contribute to neuropathology if the inﬂammatory response
remains unchecked3. The role of the activated microglia in
neuroinﬂammation is intrinsic in various neurodegenerative
disorders such as multiple sclerosis4,5, Parkinson’s Disease6,
Alzheimer’s disease7, NeuroAIDS8, stroke and traumatic brain
injury9. Understanding the regulation of microglial activation is
thus critical to comprehend the inﬂammatory processes extant in
the CNS pathology.
In keeping with the emerging interest in molecular mechanisms controlling the magnitude of microglia-mediated inﬂammatory responses in the CNS, a new and exciting aspect of gene
regulation has gained attention in recent years with the discovery
of mammalian microRNAs (miRNAs)10–12. MiRNAs are small,
evolutionarily conserved noncoding RNAs that are derived
from much larger primary transcripts. Recent studies have
demonstrated that miRNAs expressed by immune cells can
target proteins regulating inﬂammation, and consequently affect
the magnitude of the immune response13. MiRNAs are becoming
increasingly recognized as important regulators of cell functions
including glial activation13–19. While microRNA-9 (miR-9) has a
well-established role in proliferation/migration of neuronal
precursors20–22 and axon extension/branching23, its role in
mediating microglial activation remains poorly understood.
In recent years, monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein
1 (MCPIP1) was reported to control inﬂammation24,25. It was
shown that MCPIP1 was a negative regulator of macrophage
activation25 and that this anti-inﬂammatory role was mediated
via the inhibition of expression of key proinﬂammatory cytokines.
MCPIP1 was also induced by various inﬂammatory stimuli
including MCP-1 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a variety of cell
types26–29. Regulation of MCPIP1 expression by noncoding
RNAs, however, has never been explored. To identify the
miRNAs targeting evolutionary conserved sequences in the
MCPIP1 gene (ZC3H12A), computational algorithm such as
TargetScan was employed and it was found that miR-9 that is
conserved among the vertebrates was predicted to target MCPIP1.
In the present study, we report that miR-9 downregulates
MCPIP1 expression and induces the activation of microglia.
Results
MiR-9 promotes microglial activation in in vitro and in vivo.
We ﬁrst demonstrated the expression of miR-9 in primary rat
microglia using ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization (FISH; Fig. 1a).
To explore the role of miR-9 in microglial activation, primary
mouse microglia were transduced with the lentivirus expressing
miR-9 precursor (Supplementary Fig. 13) and assessed for
upregulation of the activation marker CD11b by ﬂow cytometry
analysis using anti-mouse CD11b antibody (Fig. 1b). MiR-9
mediated activation skewed the cells to an M1 phenotype with the
upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and interleukin-1b
(IL-1b) and a concomitant downregulation of the M2a phenotype
(arginase I, transforming growth factor-b and Mrc). There was no
change in the M2c phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 1a) in primary
rat microglia. These ﬁndings were also validated at the protein
level using western blots for representative proteins of the
microglial phenotypes (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The effect of
2

miR-9 on microglial activation was further conﬁrmed using
Luminex and Nitrite assays demonstrating increased expression
of the proinﬂammatory cytokines (IL-1b, tumour-necrosis factora (TNF-a), IL-6 & MCP-1; Fig. 1c) and NO (Fig. 1d) in primary
rat microglia. Reciprocally, transducing cells with the miRNA
inhibitor, miR-9-5p-locker but not miR-9-3p-locker, had the
opposing effects (Fig. 1e,f; Supplementary Fig. 1c). The extent of
miR-9 overexpression and knockdown was assessed by Northern
blot assay (Supplementary Fig. 2). Our ﬁndings demonstrated
that miR-9 was critical for the activation of microglia. It must be
stated that one of the unavoidable caveats of the in vitro study
involving primary microglia is their inherent ability to become
activated during culturing conditions. We therefore sought to
validate in vivo the role of miR-9 by microinjecting lentivirus
miR-9 into the substantia nigra (SNr) of CX3CR1-GFP mice,
which resulted in an increased microglial activation compared
with the miR-control injected group (Fig. 1g).
MiR-9 regulates MCPIP1 expression in microglia. Having
determined the role of miR-9 in microglial activation, we
then sought to investigate the mechanism(s) underlying this
effect. The next step was to predict the target of miR-9 using the
TargetScan algorithm. MCPIP1, a CCCH zinc-ﬁnger ribonuclease
(ZC3H12A) that has a conserved miR-9 binding site within its
30 -untranslated region (UTR) in most species, was identiﬁed as
the putative target of miR-9 (Fig. 2a). MCPIP1 is a novel protein
that plays a fundamental role in immune regulation29,30.
Intriguingly, co-transfecting miR-9 overexpressing vector and
pmiR-GLO plasmid with the MCPIP1 wild-type 30 -UTR resulted
in downregulation of luciferase activity, with amelioration of
this effect in BV-2 cells transfected with mutated MCPIP1
30 -UTR (Fig. 2b). In addition, the inhibition of endogenous
miR-9 expression in cells transduced with anti-miR-9 resulted in
an increased luciferase activity (Fig. 2c). In line with
this ﬁnding, miR-9 regulated the expression of both MCPIP1
mRNA (Fig. 2d) and protein (Fig. 2e) in primary rat microglia.
To further conﬁrm whether the effect of miR-9 on MCPIP1 was a
direct one, primary microglia were co-transfected with miR-9 in
the presence of either a target protector oligo (TP-MCPIP1) that
speciﬁcally protected the miR-9 binding site on the endogenous
MCPIP 30 -UTR or a scramble target protector oligo. As shown
in Fig. 2f, in the presence of a target protector oligo speciﬁc for
miR-9 binding site, miR-9 failed to downregulate the expression
of MCPIP1, a phenotype that was similar to cells transfected with
the anti-miR-9 (Fig. 2e).
MCPIP1 as a functional target of miR-9. To determine whether
miR-9-mediated functional effects depend speciﬁcally on
MCPIP1 suppression, an expression construct encoding the
entire MCPIP1 coding sequence but lacking the 30 UTR, yielding
an mRNA resistant to miRNA-mediated suppression, was generated. In primary rat microglia transfected with the MCPIP1
construct lacking the UTRs (MCPIP1-D30 UTR), and therefore
not targeted by miR-9, there was a failure of miR-9 to induce
inﬂammatory cytokines associated with microglial activation
(Fig. 3a) as well as the dominant M1 phenotype (Supplementary
Fig. 3). Consistent with this ﬁnding, transfection of primary
microglia with the TP-MCPIP1 speciﬁc for miR-9 binding site
resulted in amelioration of miR-9 mediated induction of
inﬂammatory cytokines (Fig. 3b).
Involvement of NF-jB in miR-9-mediated microglial activation. The next step was to determine the intracellular signalling
pathways involved in miR-9-induced microglial activation. The
effect of miR-9 on activation of NF-kB, AP-1 and STAT-1 was

examined. BV-2 cells were transiently co-transfected with luciferase reporter constructs NF-kB-TK-Luc, AP-1-TK-Luc, or
GAS-TK-luc and miR-9. In the presence of miR-9, there was an
increased activation of NF-kB but not AP-1 or STAT-1 (Fig. 4a),
and this effect was ameliorated in cells overexpressing MCPIP1
(Fig. 4b). Since miR-9 is known to target E-cadherin/b-catenin31,
we next sought to examine whether overexpression with
MCPIP1-D30 UTR could abrogate this effect. Primary rat
microglia transfected with miR-9 exhibited increased the
activity of b-catenin (Fig. 4c) and overexpression of MCPIP1
abrogated this effect (Fig. 4d). Further validation of miR-9mediated nuclear translocation of NF-kB and b-catenin was
demonstrated by western blot analysis (Fig. 4e). Reciprocally, cotransfection of primary microglia with the miR-9 construct and
the TP-MCPIP1 oligo resulted in failure of miR-9 to induce
activation of NF-kB and b-catenin (Fig. 4f). To further conﬁrm
the role of NF-kB and b-catenin as miR-9 downstream target

genes, primary rat microglia were transduced with anti-miR-9-5p
followed by stimulation with LPS and assessed for nuclear
translocation of NF-kB (Fig. 4g) and b-catenin (Fig. 4h). As
shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, cells transduced with anti miR-95p, failed to exhibit LPS-mediated nuclear translocation of NF-kB
and b-catenin, thereby underpinning their role as miR-9
downstream target genes.
We next validated the role of downstream transcription
factors (NF-kB versus b-catenin) in miR-9-mediated microglial
activation in the presence or absence of LPS stimulation. As
shown in Fig. 5a, pretreatment of primary rat microglia with
Ikk-2 inhibitor SC514 (5 mM) signiﬁcantly decreased miR-9mediated induction of proinﬂammatory cytokines. Intriguingly,
miR-9 potentiated the LPS-mediated activation of microglial
cells and, this effect was dampened in cells pretreated with the
Ikk-2 inhibitor (Fig. 5b). This was further conﬁrmed by the fact
that transfection of primary rat microglia with mutant IkB

resulted in amelioration of miR-9-mediated induction of
proinﬂammatory cytokines (Fig. 5c). In contrast, knock down
of b-catenin failed to exert signiﬁcant effect on miR-9-mediated
induction of proinﬂammatory cytokines (Fig. 5d). Taken
together, these data implied that MCPIP1/NF-kB, but not the
MCPIP1/b-catenin pathway was involved in miR-9-mediated
activation of microglia.

Kinetics of LPS-mediated regulation of miR-9 and MCPIP1.
The next step was to determine whether LPS mediated its
effects via induction of miR-9 and also to assess the kinetics of
the LPS response. Primary rat microglial cells exposed to LPS
resulted in a biphasic response leading to early but signiﬁcant
and transient repression of miR-9 at 1 h (Fig. 6a), with a
concomitant upregulation of MCPIP1. This was followed by

a sustained and signiﬁcant upregulation of miR-9 at 24 h
(Fig. 6b). LPS-mediated regulation of miR-9 and MCPIP1 was
further validated in primary rat microglial cells using Northern
blotting (Fig. 6c), FISH (Fig. 6d) and immunoblot analyses,
respectively (Fig. 6e).
LPS-induced microglial activation involves miR-9/MCPIP1
axis. To further assess whether miR-9 could further potentiate
microglial activation induced by LPS, cells were exposed to LPS in
the presence of miR-9 and assessed for proinﬂammatory cytokines. As shown in Fig. 7a,b, miR-9 potentiated the LPS-mediated
induction of cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, and MCP-1 and NO).
Interestingly, and as expected, LPS-induced induction of cytokines and NO was ameliorated in cells transfected with the miR-9
inhibitor, miR-9 5P, but not 3P (Fig. 7c,d). Further validation of
these ﬁndings was carried out in cells transfected with the TPMCPIP1 oligo and exposed to LPS. As shown in Fig. 7e, the
LPS-mediated activation of microglia was dampened in cells
transfected with the target protector oligo speciﬁc for miR-9
binding site (TP-MCPIP1) compared with cells transfected with
the scrambled oligo. Reciprocally, cells transfected with the miR-9
precursor demonstrated potentiation of the LPS-mediated activation of NF-kB/b-catenin pathways (Fig. 7f,g). Since LPS mediates translocation of NF-kB into the nucleus and since the
promoter of miR-9-1 has a binding site for NF-kB17, we next
sought to determine whether miR-9 mediated potentiation of
LPS-induced microglial activation was regulated via a feedback
loop between NF-kB p65 and miR-9 in primary rat microglia.
Pharmacological blocking of NF-kB in microglial cells resulted in
reduced ability of LPS to induce miR-9 (Supplementary Fig. 5a).
Though NF-kB is a known downstream target of miR-9 (ref. 17),
expression of p65 remained unaltered in the presence of miR-9
(Supplementary Fig. 5b).
Since microglial activation is a common deﬁning feature in
various neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s
disease and HAND, we also ascertained whether stimuli
other than LPS such as the neurotoxins, HIV Tat or MPP þ
could also induce miR-9 and downregulate the expression
of MCPIP1. As shown in Supplementary Figs 6,7, both Tat
and MPP þ induced the expression of miR-9 and downregulated
the expression of MCPIP in primary rat microglia. In
concordance with these ﬁndings, Tat and MPP þ also upregulated expression of proinﬂammatory cytokines, which was
ameliorated in cells transduced with lentivirus expressing antimiR-9 (Supplementary Figs 6,7).

Anti-miR-9 inhibited microglial activation in vivo. To investigate the role of miR-9 in the LPS-mediated microglial activation
in vivo, C57/BL6 mice were microinjected with either the control
GFP lentivirus or the GFP-lentivirus-anti-miR-9 5P in the SNr
and monitored for microglial activation in response to LPS. It was
however, important ﬁrst to determine the efﬁcacy of GFP-lentivirus-anti-miR-9 5P transduction in vivo. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. 8, GFP expression was largely restricted
within the SNr. Two weeks following lentivirus injections, mice
were administered LPS daily for 4 days followed by assessment of
Iba-1-positive cells in the SNr. As shown in Fig. 8a and as
expected, GFP-lentivirus-microinjected mice exhibited increased
microglial activation in the presence of LPS as evidenced by
increased Iba-1-positive cells compared with saline-injected animals. Intriguingly, LPS-mediated increase in microglial activation
was ameliorated in mice pre-treated with GFP-lentivirus-antimiR-9 5P (Fig. 8a).
Further analysis of microglia in the healthy and LPS-treated
brain was performed by injecting mice bilaterally with either anti
miR-control or anti-miR-9 in the SNr followed by LPS injection
(ip) 2 weeks later. Five days following LPS injection microglia
were isolated by Percoll gradient method and assessed by ﬂow
cytometry (CD11b þ /CD45dim population). As shown in
Fig. 8b, anti-miR-9 treatment resulted in decreased percentage
of CD11b þ /CD45dim population in the presence of LPS. The
expression of miR-9 in microglia was further conﬁrmed by the
fact that LPS treatment increased miR-9 expression in sorted
CD11b þ /CD45dim cell population (Fig. 8c). Similar ﬁndings
were also obtained in mice injected bilaterally with anti-miRcontrol or anti-miR-9 in the hippocampus (Supplementary
Fig. 9). These ﬁndings thus underpin the role of miR-9 in
regulating the LPS-mediated microglial activation in vivo.
Discussion
Our study provides new insights into the role of miR-9 in
regulating microglial activation via the common suppression of
MCPIP1 and the distinct downstream activation of NF-kB, but
not the b-catenin pathway. Modulation of miR-9/MCPIP1 can be
envisioned as a therapeutic intervention for dampening microglial activation in inﬂammatory neurodegenerative conditions.
MicroRNAs (miRs) have emerged as key regulators of the posttranscriptional control of gene expression. Previous reviews have
elegantly described the pathways by which mature miRs are
produced from their respective pri-miRs via nuclear cleavage and
cytoplamic processing32. Mature miRs can mediate regulation of

gene expression at the post transcriptional level by binding to
either the speciﬁc sites in the 30 UTR of target mRNAs or in the
coding regions of their target mRNAs, resulting in degradation or
translational block, depending on the complementarity between
the miRNAs and their binding sites33,34.
MiR-9, a highly conserved microRNA, is expressed predominantly in the CNS of the developing embryo35 exhibiting a prodifferentiation function20,21,36,37. MiR-9 is encoded by three
distinct genomic loci miR-9-1,9-2 and 9-3 that give rise to mature
miR-9 species with identical sequences. A recent study has
implicated the role of mature miR-9 in controlling the stability of
Hes1 mRNA and as an important player in the Hes1 ultradian
oscillations38. MiR-9 is known to promote proliferation of
neuronal progenitors by targeting stathimin, which increases
microtubule instability20. Recent study has also reported the miR9-mediated regulation of axonal extension and branching via
targeting Map1b in mouse cortical neurons23. In addition to its
involvement in neurogenesis, miR-9 expression also plays a role
in gastric adenocarcinoma39. While most cells of the CNS express
miR-9, a recent study indicates the lack of miR-9 activity in
murine microglia under basal conditions40. In agreement with the
ﬁndings of Akerblom et al., our study also demonstrated no
expression of miR-9 RNA in microglial cells in brain
sections from control mice, however, following LPS injection,
there was induction of mature miR-9 in Iba-1 positive
microglia (Supplementary Fig. 10). Lending credence to LPSmediated induction of miR-9 is the ﬁnding by Bazzoni et. al.17,

demonstrating upregulated expression of miR-9 in LPS-exposed
monocytes. Consistent with this ﬁnding17, our study also
demonstrated that exposure to LPS resulted in induced
expression of pre-miR-9-1 at 6 and 12 h (2.55- and 3.85-fold),
respectively (Supplementary Fig. 11). There was no change in
pre-miR-9-2/3 following LPS treatment. On the basis of this, the
focus of our study was on the mature miR-9. Our ﬁndings for the
ﬁrst time demonstrate that LPS induced the expression of miR-9
in primary cultured microglia and also regulated microglial
activation, both in vitro and in vivo in response to inﬂammatory
stimuli. One possible explanation for the expression of miR-9 in
untreated, cultured microglial primary cells and cell lines could be
attributed to the inherent ability of these cells to become activated
during cultured conditions. Taken together, our ﬁndings
implicate miR-9 as a regulator of microglial activation via its
suppression of the target anti-inﬂammatory gene MCPIP1. In
pathological events such as brain inﬂammation, when miR-9 is
upregulated, treatment with anti-miR-9 may have a beneﬁcial
effect by dampening microglial activation, thus leading to
reduction of neuroinﬂammation. Indeed, we observed that
microinjecting anti-miR-9 into the CNS resulted in deactivation
and suppression of LPS-induced microglial activation.
Another novel ﬁnding of this study was that MCPIP1, a novel
anti-inﬂammatory molecule was a target of miR-9-mediated
microglial activation, and these ﬁndings were conﬁrmed
in primary microglia inhibited for miR-9 activity. Brieﬂy,
knocking down of miR-9 activity via the miR-9 inhibitor or

MCPIP1-target protector oligo approaches, resulted in failure of
miR-9 to activate the microglia, thereby underpinning MCPIP1
as a downstream target of miR-9 mediated induction of
inﬂammatory cytokines. These data lend credence to previous
reports indicating the involvement of MCPIP1 signalling in
regulating inﬂammatory responses via its functioning as an
RNase to promote the degradation of inﬂammatory mRNAs
such as IL-6 and IL-1b27 and owing to its ability to function as a
deubiquitinase that negatively regulates JNK and NF-kB
signalling by targeting TNF receptor-associated factors29.
In addition, elegant studies by Liang et al.30 have
also demonstrated that MCPIP1 can negatively regulate
inﬂammatory responses as evidenced by the fact that there is
increased microglial activation in MCPIP1 KO compared with
the WT mice. In this study, MCPIP1 deﬁciency resulted in
increased infarct size following ischaemic stroke30. Consistent
with this study, our ﬁndings also suggest the role of MCPIP1 as
an anti-inﬂammatory factor. While Liang et al.30 observed an
increased expression of MCPIP1 that was time dependent
following exposure to LPS, our ﬁndings indicated a biphasic
response to LPS. This discrepancy could be attributed to the
strain and concentration of LPS and the conditions used in the
two studies. In our study, lower concentration of LPS
(10 ng ml  1) demonstrated a sustained increase in the
expression of MCPIP1 (Supplementary Fig. 12).

Our ﬁndings suggested that transduction of primary microglia
with miR-9 resulted in the upregulation of microglial activation
markers CD11b and proinﬂammatory cytokines/chemokines
(IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-6 and MCP-1). Intriguingly, miR-9 further
potentiated LPS-induced microglial activation as evidenced by
increased cytokine production. Reciprocally, inhibition of miR-9
activity via either the anti-miR-9 or the target protector oligo of
MCPIP1 resulted in a dampened inﬂammatory response in the
presence of LPS. These ﬁndings further underscore the role of
miR-9/MCPIP1 axis in mediating LPS-induced generation of
inﬂammatory cytokines. It must be noted that miR-9 was not the
only pathway of LPS-mediated activation of microglia since
blocking this signalling pathway did not fully abrogate the
cytokine response. A possible explanation for this could be that
activation of various other signalling pathways such as the TLRs
could be functional in the presence of LPS. Another interesting
ﬁnding of this study was that diverse activation stimuli such as
HIV Tat or MPP þ also mediated microglial activation via the
miR-9/MCPIP1 axis thereby underscoring the role of this
pathway as a common mechanism of neuroinﬂammation
involving microglia.
Using both pharmacological and genetic approaches, we
demonstrated that NF-kB activation was involved in miR-9mediated microglia activation since Ikk-2 inhibitor and transfection of microglia with mutant IkB ameliorated miR-9-mediated

microglial activation. Our results are in agreement with previous
reports that NF-kB activation was involved in microglial
activation. Another interesting ﬁnding herein was the observation
that inhibition of NF-kB resulted in failure of LPS to induce miR9 expression. It can thus be postulated that there was a positive
feedback loop between NF-kB activation and miR-9 expression
since the pre-miR-9-1 promoter has a NF-kB binding site17.
MCPIP1 is known to exert its action by inhibition of activation of
NF-kB29. However, whether miR-9 regulates NF-kB p65
activation is unclear though NF-kB1 (p50/105) was a direct
target of miR-9 (ref. 17). Herein we report that transduction of
microglial cells with miR-9 resulted in the downregulation of
MCPIP1 levels and nuclear translocation of NF-kB leading to
microglial activation.
These ﬁndings were also validated in vivo wherein a genetic
approach using the lenti-anti-miR-9 was employed. Microinjection of lenti-anti-miR-9 into the hippocampus/SNr of mice
followed by LPS injection, resulted in restoration of microglial
activation thus validating the role of miR-9 in microglial
activation.
In summary, miR-9 plays a crucial role in microglial
activation via suppression of MCPIP1 expression and subsequent downstream activation of NF-kB but not the b-catenin
pathway. MiR-9/MCPIP1 axis thus mediates a regulatory
pathway critical for eliciting innate immune responses in
microglia. Speciﬁc blocking of the miR-9 could be considered
as a potential therapeutic target for treating neuroinﬂammatory
conditions involving microgliosis.

Methods
Reagents. The miR-9 overexpression has-miR-9-1 and miR-control and miR-9
inhibitor hsa-miR-9-5p-locker/hsa-miR-9-3p-locker and miR-locker-control plasmids and lentiviruses were purchased from Biosettia (San Diego). HIV-1 Tat1-72
was ordered from the UK College of Medicine, Lexington, KY. LPS (Escherichia coli
055:B5), MPP þ and Ikk-2 inhibitor-SC514 were purchased from Sigma Chemicals.
Animals. C57BL/6N mice (male, 6–8 weeks) were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). CX3CR1-GFP homozygous mice were
obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbour, Maine) and function by
targeted deletion of CX3CR1 and GFP reporter insertion. These mice are known to
exhibit a rapid microglial response injury as shown by Davalos et al.1,41 in response
to ATP. All the animals were housed under conditions of constant temperature and
humidity on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle, with lights on at 0700 h. Food and water
were available ad libitum. Animals were deeply anaesthetized by overdose of
isoﬂurane followed by pneumothorax before perfusion. All animal procedures were
performed according to the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
Cell cultures. Primary microglia cells were obtained from 1 to 3-day-old C57BL/
6N or Sprague–Dawley newborn pups from Charles River Laboratories, Inc.. After
digestion and dissociation of the dissected brain cortices in Hank’s buffered salt
solution supplemented with trypsin (1 mg ml  1), mixed glial cultures were prepared by resuspending the cell suspension in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium,
supplemented with 10% heated inactivated fetal bovine serum and 10 mg ml  1
gentamicin. Cells were plated at 20  106 cells per ﬂask density onto 75 cm2 cell
culture ﬂasks. The cell medium was replaced each 5 days and, after the ﬁrst
medium change, M-CSF (0.25 ng ml  1, macrophage colony-stimulating factor;
PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) was added to the ﬂasks to promote microglial proliferation. After achieving 90% conﬂuency mixed glial cultures were subjected to
shaking at 37 °C at 220 g for 2 h, to promote microglia detachment from the ﬂasks.
The cell medium, containing the released microglia cells, was collected from each
ﬂask and centrifuged at 100 g for 5 min to collect cells and plated cell culture plates.

BV-2 immortalized cells (a kind gift from Dr Sanjay Maggirwar, University of
Rochester, Medical Center, Rochester, NY) were grown and routinely maintained
in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium (4.5 g l  1 glucose; 2% fetal bovine serum;
50 mg ml  1 gentamycin) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. BV-2 cells were
used up to passage 20. Both primary rat and mouse microglial cells were used to
examine the role of miR-9 in microglial activation in vitro study. For in vivo
assessment of microglial activation, primary mouse microglial cells were used. Only
for the luciferase study, BV-2 cell line was used to examine the regulation of miR-9
on the transcription factors.
Flow cytometry. Primary mouse microglia were assayed for surface antigens by
ﬂow cytometry according to a previous report42. Brieﬂy, Fc receptors were blocked
with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 antibody (1:100, eBioscience). Microglial cells were
stained with Alexa Fluor 488 Rat anti-mouse isotope IgG or CD11b (1:100, BD
Pharmingen). LSR II (BD Biosciences) was used for ﬂuorescence acquisition and
data were analysed with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). For each antibody,
gating was determined based on the appropriate negative isotope stained controls.
Cytokine and chemokine analysis by Luminex. Expression of cytokines/
chemokines in supernatants collected from treated and untreated microglia was
measured using MilliplexTM MAP kit (Rat Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead
Panel) from Millipore as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Brieﬂy, this is a beadbased suspension array using the Luminex MAP technology in which ﬂuorescentcoded beads have cytokine capture antibodies on the bead surface to bind the
proteins. Detailed information about the Nitrite assay can be found in
Supplementary Information online.
Nitrite assay. Nitrite levels, a stable end product resulting from the reaction of
NO with molecular oxygen, were determined in rat primary microglia by adding
50 ml of cell culture medium with 50 ml of Griess reagent (0.1% naphtyletylenediamine dihydrochloride, 1% sulphanilamide, 2.5% phosphoric acid, all from
Sigma) in a 96-well plate. The absorbance at 550 nm was measured by Synergy Mx
10

ﬂuorescence plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments) and nitrite concentrations were
calculated using a standard curve with sodium nitrite (NaNO2, Sigma, level of
sensitivity, 0.4 mM).
Luciferase activity assays. The 804 bp human MCPIP1 30 UTR containing the
putative miR-9 target site was PCR ampliﬁed from human genomic DNA by using
the forward 50 -ctcgctagcctcgagtctaggctgcctgtggctggcaagggcagcacccc-30 and reverse
50 -gcctgcaggtcgactctagagaaagggctcacaatgattgtactttattg-30 primers and the DNA
fragment was cloned into the XhoI and XbaI sites on the 30 end of the luc2 gene on
the pmirGLO vector. For pmirGLO-MCPIP1 30 UTR-miR-9-target-mutant vector,
the miR-9 target site (accaaag) within the MCPIP1 30 UTR was changed to ctttgtt by
PCR mutagenesis with primers MCPIP1-miR-9T-F, 50 -gtcgggaaggaaacccacaactttgttatactgtaggattggttctggcccatgcag-30 and MCPIP1-miR-9T-R, 50 -cagaaccaatcctacagtataacaaagttgtgggtttccttcccgacttgaatcctc-30 . Brieﬂy, the BV-2 cells were
transfected with miR-9 overexpression pLV-(hsa-miR-9-1) vector and the target
plasmid pmirGLO-MCPIP1-30 UTR or pmirGLO-MCPIP1 30 UTR-miR-9-targetmutant in a molar ratio 50:1. The miRNA control pLV-(miR-control) plasmid was
used as a negative control. The luciferase activity was determined 24 h post
transfection and the reporter assay was followed the manufacturer’s protocol
(Promega). Renilla luciferase activity was normalized to ﬁreﬂy luciferase and
expressed as a percentage of the control (n43, performed in ﬁve wells each time).
Oligos and plasmid transfection. The LNA control (Scramble sequence:TAACACGTCTATACGCCCA; catalogue number480001-00) and custom-designed
MCPIP1-Target Protector (TP-MCPIP1; sequence:TGGTATCTTTGGTTTGAG)
were purchased from Exiqon (Woburn, MA). TP-MCPIP1 oligo selectively
protects MCPIP from being targeted by miR-9, without affecting endogenous levels
of miR-9 or its interaction with other mRNA targets. Microglia were transfected
with 20 nmol l  1 short interfering RNAs speciﬁc for b-catenin (GAACAACGCC
AGCGACAUU) were obtained from Thermo Scientiﬁc Dharmacon RNAi
Technologies (Accell SMART Pool). Flag/Flag-MCPIP1, Vector/mutant IkB
plasmids were transected using the SiIMPORTERTM (Millipore, Temecula, CS)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The knockdown and transfect efﬁciency

of short interfering RNA was determined 2 days post transfection by reverse
transcriptase–PCR and western blot analysis, respectively.

week later, mice were perfused and sectioned followed by assessment of number of
processes for GFP þ microglia from four mice per group.

Western blotting. Treated cells were lysed using the Mammalian Cell Lysis kit
(Sigma-Aldrich). Equal amounts of the proteins were electrophoresed in a sodium
dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel (12%) under reducing conditions followed by
transfer to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes. The blots were blocked with 5%
non-fat dry milk in PBS. The western blots were then probed with antibodies
recognizing the MCPIP1 (1:1,000, Santa Cruz), b-actin (1:1,000, Sigma-Aldrich)
p65 NF-kB (1:200, Cell Signalling), b-catenin (1:200, Cell Signalling), Lamin B
(1:1,000, Santa Cruz) The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidaseconjugated to goat anti mouse/rabbit IgG (1:5,000) as described previously43.
Full blots can be found in Supplementary Fig. 14.

Anti-miR-9 ameliorated microglial activation in vivo. Eight-week-old C57BL/6N
mice were divided into four groups of 20 mice with each group (n ¼ 5; male)
treated with either: (1) Saline þ anti-miR-control lentivirus; (2) Saline þ anti-miR-9
lentivirus; (3) LPS þ anti-miR-control lentivirus; (4) LPS þ anti-miR-9 lentivirus.
The lentiviruses were microinjected into the SNr of mice (1 ml of 109 viral genomes
per ml) using the microinjection parameters (coordinates 2.8 mm behind the
bregma, 1.7 mm lateral from the sagittal midline at a depth of 4.5 mm to skull
surface). Another set of animals were microinjected with lentiviruses into hippocampus of mice (1 ml of 109 viral genomes per ml) using the microinjection parameters (coordinates 2.06 mm behind the bregma, ±1.5 mm lateral from the
sagittal midline at a depth of 1.7 mm to skull surface). To reduce the volume of
inoculation and increase the precision, a 10-ml Hamilton syringe with a 33G needle
was utilized for intra-SNr/hippocampus injections as described. Two weeks later,
mice were injected with LPS (1 mg kg  1, i.p.) for 5 days. To evaluate the effect of
miR-9-5p-locker on microglial activation-induced by LPS, groups of 20 mice were
divided as described above, perfused and sections followed by Iba-1 staining for the
assessment of microglial activation.

Real-time PCR. For quantitative analysis of mRNA expression, comparative realtime PCR was performed with the use of the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems). The sequences for the ampliﬁcation of rat MCPIP1 were:
50 -TGCCTATCACAGACCAGCAC-30 (forward) and 50 -TGTCATTGGAC
ACCACCACTC-30 (reverse). The primer sequences for the ampliﬁcation of
GAPDH were as follows: 50 -GCCAAAAGGGTCATCATCTC-30 (forward); 50 -GG
CATGGACTGTGGTCATGAG-30 (reverse). For the analysis of miR-9, total RNA
was isolated from cells as described above. Comparative real-time PCR was performed using the Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).
Speciﬁc primers and probes for mature miR-9 and snRNA RNU6B were obtained
from Applied Biosystems. The primer sequences for the ampliﬁcation of different
miR-9 were as follows: mouse miR-9-1: 50 -GGTCCTGGATCC CATCTTTT-30
(forward) and 50 -GCGCAGTGTATGGGGTTATT-30 (reverse); mouse miR-9-2:
50 -AAGCTTAAACGCGGCAAGTA-30 (forward) and 50 -TCGGTGACCTTGAAGGAGTT-30 (reverse); mouse miR-9-3: 50 -GGAGTCCGTGTGTCTGTGT
G-30 (forward) and 50 -GCTTTATGA CGGCTCTGTGG-30 (reverse). All reactions
were run in triplicate. The amount of miR-9 was obtained by normalizing to
snRNA RNU6B and relative to control as previously reported44.
In situ hybridization and immunostaining. Primary rat microglia (d12 in vitro) or
mouse brain sections were ﬁxed and were prehybridized in hybridization buffer
(50% formamide, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mg ml  1 yeast tRNA, 1  Denhardt’s solution, 600 mM NaCl, 0.25% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Dextran sulphate)
at a concentration of 9 pM for the commercially available digoxigenin-labelled
miR-9 probe (Exiqon). LNA-modiﬁed miR-9, labelled at both the 50 and 30 ends
with digoxigenin (Exiqon), were diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 2 pM in
hybridization buffer, heated to 65 °C for 5 min and separately hybridized to the
sections at 37 °C overnight. The slides were then washed twice in hybridization
buffer (without probe) at 37 °C, followed by washing three times in 2  SSC and
twice in 0.2  SSC at 42 °C. They were then blocked with 1% bovine serum
albumin, 3% normal goat serum in 1  PBS for 1 h at room temperature and
incubated with anti-digoxigenin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:100,
Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and anti-Iba-1 (1:250, Dako) antibodies
overnight at 4 °C. The slides were washed twice with PBS and incubated with Alexa
Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) antibody for 1 h at
room temperature. This was followed by two PBS washes and signal ampliﬁcation
(for the in situ, now labelled with horseradish peroxidase) using TSA Cy5 kit
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The slides
were mounted in Prolong gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). The
speciﬁcity of the miR-9 signal in FISH experiments was conﬁrmed when compared
with a scrambled control. Unlike the miR-9, the scramble probe showed no signal
in microglia.
Northern blots. Total RNA was extracted from primary rat microglia treated with
LPS for 24 h using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and run on a 15% Tris/Borate/EDTA
(90 mM Tris/64.6 mM boric acid/2.5 mM EDTA (pH8.3)) Urea gel (Invitrogen)
and transferred to a Nytran nylon transfer membrane (Ambion, Austin, TX). The
membranes were cross linked and prehybridized for at least 1h with Ultra-Hyb
solution (Ambion), followed by hybridization to the LNA DIG-probe for miRNA-9
(Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) or the snRNA RNU6B probe according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Transduction of primary mouse microglia with miR-9 lentivirus. Primary
mouse microglia were transduced with miR-Control, miR-9 lentivirus with multiplicity of infection of 100, followed by gentle swirling, incubation and replacement of fresh feed medium. The transduction efﬁciency was determined by
detecting red ﬂuorescent protein-positive microglia at 4 days post transduction
(Supplementary Fig. 13).
MiR-9-induced microglial activation in vivo. MiR-control or miR-9 lentivirus
were microinjected into SNr in CX3CR1-GFP mice (1 ml of 109 viral genomes per
ml) using the microinjection parameters (coordinates 2.8 mm behind the bregma,
1.7 mm lateral from the sagittal midline at a depth of 4.5 mm to skull surface). Two

Mouse microglia isolation. Groups of mice were microinjected bilaterally either
with miR-control or anti-miR-9 followed by LPS injection (described above). Five
days post LPS injection, microglia were isolated from whole brain homogenates by
Percoll gradient centrifugation according the previous reports45,46 with slight
modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, the brains were homogenized in PBS (pH 7.4) by passing
through a 70-mm nylon cell strainer. Resulting homogenates were centrifuged at
600g for 6 min. Supernatants were removed and cell pellets were resuspended in
70% isotonicPercoll (GE-healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) at room temperature. A
discontinuous Percoll density gradient was layered as follows: 70, 50, 35 and 0%
isotonic Percoll. The gradient was centrifuged for 20 min at 2,000 g and microglia
were collected from the interphase between the 70 and 50% Percoll layers. Cells
were washed and then resuspended in sterile PBS followed by Flow cytometry
analysis by gating the myeloid cells for the CD11b þ /CD45dim population.
Immunostaining and image analysis. For Iba-1 immunostaining, sections
encompassing the entire midbrain were sectioned at 12 mm on a cryostat. Slides
were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 45 min at room temperature followed by
permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS followed by incubation with H2O2
for 10 min. Sections were incubated with a blocking buffer containing 10% NGS in
PBS for 1 h at room temperature followed by addition of rabbit anti-Iba-1 (1:250;
Wako) antibody and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Next day, sections were washed
followed by incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G
(1:200) in immunoblocking buffer at RT for 1 h and incubated with an avidinbiotin-peroxidase kit for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase reaction product was visualized with enhanced DAB peroxidase substrate kit. Every sixth section from each
mouse was used to quantify Iba-1-positive cells in the midbrain and hippocampus.
The immunostaining signals were quantitatively analysed using the Optical
Fractionator method with Microbrightﬁeld Stereo-Investigator software (Stereo
Investigator software, Microbrightﬁeld, VT, USA). The total number of Iba-1
microglia in entire area of SNpc was counted from four or ﬁve samples per group.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t-test or
one-way analysis of variance followed by Holm–Sidak test (SigmaPlot 11.0). The
appropriate test was clariﬁed in the ﬁgure legends. Results were judged statistically
signiﬁcant if Po0.05 by analysis of variance.
