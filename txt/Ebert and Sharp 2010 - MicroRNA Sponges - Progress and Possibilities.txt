ABSTRACT
The microRNA (miRNA) ‘‘sponge’’ method was introduced three years ago as a means to create continuous miRNA loss of
function in cell lines and transgenic organisms. Sponge RNAs contain complementary binding sites to a miRNA of interest, and
are produced from transgenes within cells. As with most miRNA target genes, a sponge’s binding sites are specific to the miRNA
seed region, which allows them to block a whole family of related miRNAs. This transgenic approach has proven to be a useful
tool to probe miRNA functions in a variety of experimental systems. Here we will discuss the ways sponge and related
constructs can be optimized and review recent applications of this method with particular emphasis on stable expression in
cancer studies and in transgenic animals.

INTRODUCTION
The widespread involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in
regulating developmental processes, physiological responses,
and pathological conditions in animals has been amply
demonstrated (He and Hannon 2004; Bushati and Cohen
2007; Bartel 2009). Nonetheless, the specific functions of
each miRNA in the various contexts in which it is expressed
are only beginning to be discovered. The typical miRNA is
computationally predicted to regulate hundreds of target
genes (Friedman et al. 2009), and while there has been
progress in compiling sets of predicted targets into pathways
(Tsang et al. 2010), every prediction still needs to be
experimentally validated. The best experimental approaches
create a loss of function in the miRNA of interest. Lossof-function approaches are superior because they reveal functions that depend on physiological miRNA levels; by contrast, adding exogenous miRNA to the system can result in
repression of nonphysiological target mRNAs since miRNA–
target interaction is strongly concentration-dependent
(S Mukherji, MS Ebert, GZ Zheng, JS Tsang, PA Sharp, A
van Oudenaarden, in prep.).
There are three general methods for miRNA lossof-function studies: genetic knockouts, antisense oligonucleotide inhibitors (Meister et al. 2004; Krützfeldt et al. 2005;
Ørom et al. 2006) and sponges (Ebert et al. 2007). The sponge

mRNA, which contains multiple target sites complementary
to a miRNA of interest, is a dominant negative method (see
Fig. 1). When the sponge is expressed at high levels, it
specifically inhibits the activity of a family of miRNAs sharing
a common seed (miRNA nucleotides 2–7, the major specificity determinant for target recognition [Lewis et al. 2003]).
While deleting the gene encoding a miRNA is the only way to
guarantee complete loss of its activity, the sponge method
offers several advantages. First is the convenience of making
dominant negative transgenics over knockouts, and the
applicability to a broader range of model organisms and cell
lines. Second, many miRNAs have seed family members
encoded at multiple distant loci; due to this functional
redundancy, these miRNAs would have to be knocked out
individually and the animals bred to generate the complete
knockout strain. Furthermore, some miRNA precursors are
transcribed in clusters; the proximity of the miRNAs within
a cluster may make it difficult to cleanly delete one miRNA
without affecting the processing of the others. Since sponges
interact with the mature miRNA, their effectiveness is unaffected by the clustering of miRNA precursors.
Sponges also offer advantages over chemically modified
antisense oligonucleotide inhibitors for many research
applications. First, these antisense inhibitors appear to be
specific for one miRNA as they depend upon extensive
sequence complementarity beyond the seed region (Davis
et al. 2006; Esau 2008). Thus, to neutralize a family of
miRNAs may require the delivery of a mixture of perfectly
complementary oligonucleotides. In addition, many cells
both in vitro and in vivo are resistant to the uptake of
oligonucleotides. By contrast, for difficult-to-transfect cell

lines or cells in vivo, the sponge transgene can be delivered
by a viral vector. Inclusion of an open reading frame for a
selectable marker or reporter gene in the vector allows for
selection or screening, fluorescence-activated cell sorting,
or even laser capture microdissection of cells strongly
expressing the sponge. This makes it possible to isolate
a fraction of cells in which the family of miRNAs is strongly
inhibited, which can reveal even subtle changes in target
gene expression. In principle, one could include regulatory
elements in the sponge promoter to make it drug-inducible
or tissue-specific for the tissue of choice. By contrast, the
cholesterol-modified ‘‘antagomir’’ oligonucleotides that can
be injected into the mouse cannot access all tissues, and
mostly accumulate in the liver (Krützfeldt et al. 2005).
Finally, antagomirs require repeated administration in large
doses to inhibit a miRNA over long durations, whereas one
could generate germline transgenic sponge-expressing animals to continuously inhibit the miRNA of interest for the
lifetime of the animal.
Although sponge technology has advantages in more
biological experiments, antisense type technology is more
promising from the perspective of therapeutically inhibiting
miRNAs. This promise depends on continued development
of oligonucleotide chemistries and improvement in the
delivery of antisense oligonucleotides to cells and tissues.
SPONGE DESIGN
Variations of miRNA sponge type constructs have been
described as target mimics (Franco-Zorrilla et al. 2007),

decoys (Carè et al. 2007), miRNA target (miRT) sequences
(Gentner et al. 2009), miRNA erasers (Sayed et al. 2008),
and lentivirus-mediated antagomirs (Scherr et al. 2007; for
currently available miRNA sponge constructs and their
intended applications, see Table 1). The miRNA binding
sites in these constructs are either perfectly antisense or
contain mismatches in the middle positions, which if
perfectly base-paired would be vulnerable to Ago2-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage. Sponges with sites perfectly
complementary to the miRNA show some inhibitory
activity (Carè et al. 2007; Ebert et al. 2007; Scherr et al.
2007; Bonci et al. 2008; Sayed et al. 2008; Gentner et al. 2009;
Haraguchi et al. 2009; Horie et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2010;
Papapetrou et al. 2010), perhaps because miRNAs complexed with the catalytically inactive Argonautes 1, 3, and 4
can still be titrated by these sites without cleavage of the
sponge RNA. More effective are sponges containing bulged
sites that are mispaired opposite miRNA positions 9–12
(Ebert et al. 2007, Gentner et al. 2009), presumably because
they form a more stable interaction with the miRNA, including miRNA complexed with Ago2.
Typical sponge constructs contain four to 10 binding sites
separated by a few nucleotides each. Increasing the number
of binding sites may have diminishing marginal utility, as
each site increases the probability of sponge RNA degradation. Variations in the bulged mismatches and the spacers
can be introduced to reduce the risk of recombination
during cloning and to reduce the risk of introducing
unintended binding motifs for other regulatory factors. Sites
are normally placed in an unstructured, noncoding region of
the RNA. For PolIII-generated sponge RNAs, which lack a
59 cap and 39 poly(A) tail, terminal stem–loops can be included
as stabilizing elements (Ebert et al. 2007). Another type of
transgenic antisense inhibitor, TuD (‘‘tough decoy’’) RNAs,
place the miRNA binding site or sites in the single-stranded
regions of short stem–loops, precisely presenting them for
binding to miRNA complexes (Haraguchi et al. 2009).
The efficacy of a miRNA sponge depends not just on the
affinity and avidity of binding sites, but also on the
concentration of sponge RNAs relative to the concentration
of the miRNA. To maximize sponge expression, the strongest available promoter for the cell type of interest should be
used, e.g., a CMV promoter in many mammalian cell lines.
For transient assays, plasmid transfection can deliver the
highest dose of the sponge transgene. For viral delivery of
sponges, transduction with high multiplicity of infection
should be performed. Since random integration of the
sponge transgene may disrupt an endogenous gene, it is
advisable to generate multiple clonal lines or make polyclonal lines. The choice of viral vector can contribute to
DNA copy number and to cell-type specificity. Sponges
delivered in vivo can also make use of tissue-specific
promoters in cases where the miRNA of interest is expressed
in multiple cell types that could confound an observed
loss-of-function phenotype. In principle, stably propagated

episomal vectors (Kimchi 1999) should be an effective alternative to chromosomally inserted sponge transgenes.
For inclusion of a reporter in the sponge construct, any
protein-coding gene that can be tolerated at high expression
levels is allowable. Preferably it is placed directly upstream
of the miRNA binding sites (as opposed to being in
a separate cistron in the same vector), such that the protein
expression directly represents sponge RNA expression. Drug
resistance markers allow for stringent selection of high
sponge-expressing clones. Fluorescent reporters enable
quantitative analysis and sorting of individual live cells,
and can be diversified with different colors representing
different miRNA sponges.
LIMITATIONS OF THE SPONGE METHOD
It should be noted that optimized sponges may still exhibit
different degrees of inhibition in different contexts. Where
miRNA concentration is very high, complete titration
demands a very high and possibly unachievable dose of
sponge RNA. On the other hand, in cells expressing a large
pool of endogenous targets for the miRNA family of
interest, there should be less free miRNA available (Arvey
et al. 2010), so a lower dose of sponge RNA should suffice
to give strong inhibition. High expression levels of sponge
transgenes such as those that express a GFP reporter are
not known to create any off-target effects, but such effects
should be ruled out by comparing phenotypes and gene
expression profiles not only between the miRNA sponge
and an empty or nonspecific control vector treatment, but
also between the control vector treatment and no treatment.
Determining whether a sponge treatment is successfully
inhibiting the miRNA of interest is more challenging than
validating the success of genetic miRNA deletion, which
results in a clean loss of the mature miRNA. The efficacy of
sponge constructs can be validated in cell culture by reporter
assay or assays for the expression of known target genes.
Typically a luciferase reporter fused to miRNA binding sites
or a confirmed target 39 UTR is measured in the presence of
the miRNA sponge or a negative control sponge containing
no binding sites or nonspecific sites. In the presence of the
miRNA of interest, the luciferase reporter should be significantly derepressed by the miRNA sponge. In this case it is
also difficult to assess whether inhibition of different seed
family members occurs to the same degree, as a given target
reporter is regulated by all of the expressed members of the
seed family.
TRANSIENT APPLICATIONS FOR miRNA SPONGES
The immediate application of miRNA sponges as first
described was transient treatment and assay in cell culture
models. A number of reports demonstrate the flexibility of
the method with respect to cell type, promoter, vector,
2046

reporter gene, and type of miRNA targeted (see Table 1).
Sponges were transfected or transduced into human, mouse,
and rat cell lines such as nonsmall cell lung cancer (Kumar
et al. 2008), B cell lymphoma (Bolisetty et al. 2009), embryonic neural stem cells (Rybak et al. 2008), and dissociated
hippocampal neurons (Edbauer et al. 2010). Sponge RNAs
were transcribed from strong promoters such as CMV
(Rybak et al. 2008; Elcheva et al. 2009), U6 (Sayed et al.
2008), and viral LTRs (Kumar et al. 2008). The most
commonly used vectors were plasmids (Kumar et al. 2008;
Rybak et al. 2008; Elcheva et al. 2009; Edbauer et al. 2010),
but some used retroviruses (Bolisetty et al. 2009), lentiviruses
(Horie et al. 2009; Nachmani et al. 2009) or adenovirus
(Sayed et al. 2008). Individual miRNAs, e.g., miR-155
(Bolisetty et al. 2009), or large seed families, e.g., let-7
(Kumar et al. 2008), were successfully targeted. The most
common reporter gene was eGFP (Rybak et al. 2008;
Bolisetty et al. 2009; Elcheva et al. 2009; Nachmani et al.
2009), but mCherry (Edbauer et al. 2010) and luciferase
(Horie et al. 2009) were also used. Typically, cellular assays
and target validation assays (visualization of derepressed
target protein or 39 UTR reporter expression) were performed 24–72 h after introduction of the sponge construct.
One fortuitous aspect of sponge treatment is that it may
cause a significant and specific reduction in the miRNA
level (Rybak et al. 2008; Sayed et al. 2008; Horie et al.
2009), in some cases even to an extent that the miRNA is
undetectable by Northern blot (Sayed et al. 2008). This may
indicate that miRNA–target interaction stimulates degradation of the miRNA. Target reporter sites with extensive
complementarity to the 39 end of the miRNA appear to accelerate exonucleolytic trimming of the miRNA in fruitflies
and mammalian cells (Ameres et al. 2010). This phenomenon may occur at both centrally bulged and perfect sponge
sites. Another positive outcome is the absence of any
feedback response that would up-regulate the miRNA upon
introduction of increased target sites in the form of the
miRNA sponge. Even though early results with transiently
introduced sponges were encouraging, it was not certain
that sponge mRNAs would be able to accumulate to levels
sufficient to inhibit miRNA in stable expression formats.
Recent results indicate that this is possible.
STABLE miRNA SPONGE EXPRESSION
Continuous expression of the sponge inhibitor makes it
possible to perform long-term miRNA loss-of-function
studies in cell culture and in vivo assays, such as bone
marrow reconstitution and cancer xenografts. Several groups
have achieved stable miRNA sponge activity by expressing
the transgene from chromosomal integrations (Scherr et al.
2007; Bonci et al. 2008; Gentner et al. 2009; Haraguchi
et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2010; Valastyan et al. 2009; Barbato
et al. 2010; Gatt et al. 2010; Gottwein and Cullen 2010; Ma
et al. 2010a,b; Papapetrou et al. 2010; Starczynowski et al.

MicroRNA sponges: Progress and possibilities

2010; see Table 1). The challenge for stable expression is to
produce a sufficient dose of sponge mRNA given much
lower transgene copy numbers compared to transient
plasmid transfection. The good news from recent reports
is that even partial miRNA inhibition can yield measurable
and interesting phenotypes.
One of the applications of stable sponge expression is to
probe the roles of miRNAs in differentiation pathways.
Barbato et al. used a lentiviral sponge in post-mitotic
primary cerebellar granule neurons to assay the effect of
miR-92, which is down-regulated over the course of neuronal maturation. At 6 d in vitro, the sponge-expressing
neurons showed derepression of the potassium chloride
cotransporter KCC2 and electrophysiological changes in
response to GABA treatment (Barbato et al. 2010). Similarly,
Huang et al. used a stably expressed retroviral sponge in
mesenchymal stem cells to assay the role of miR-204 in an in
vitro differentiation time-course lasting 10 d. Continuous
inhibition of miR-204 strongly reduced adipogenic differentiation while increasing markers of osteogenic differentiation (Huang et al. 2010). Papapetrou et al. sought to probe
the role of the erythroid-specific, closely clustered miRNAs,
miR-144 and miR-451, in blood cell development. To this
end they used lentiviral sponges marked with a different
color fluorescent reporter for each miRNA to dissect their
relative contributions in erythropoiesis (Papapetrou et al.
2010). Bone marrow reconstitution was performed with a
1:1 mixture of a green control sponge with a red (miR-144)
or a yellow (miR-451) sponge, or both. Three to four weeks
after transplantation, the competitive repopulation of the
chimeric blood was analyzed by flow cytometry. Both
miRNAs were found to be required for normal progression through the first stage of erythroblast maturation, and
their simultaneous inhibition showed that they act additively.
One of the most common applications of stably expressed sponges is to mimic the down-regulation of specific
miRNAs that are aberrantly expressed in certain disease states.
For example, by screening miRNA expression and metastatic
potential of a panel of mammary cell lines, Valastyan et al.
identified miR-31 as strongly down-regulated in aggressive
metastatic cancer (Valastyan et al. 2009). They set up an
experimental model wherein human nonmetastatic breast
cancer cells transduced with retroviral eGFP sponges for
miR-31 or an irrelevant sequence were orthotopically implanted in mouse mammary fat pads. Primary tumor size
was not significantly affected by the inhibition of miR-31,
but, while the control sponge tumors did not metastasize,
miR-31 sponge tumors metastasized to the lungs, forming 10
times more lesions (easily identifiable by their GFP fluorescence). This result allowed the investigators to identify
miR-31 as a suppressor of metastasis. A similar approach
was taken to show that miR-10b (Ma et al. 2010a) and miR-9
(Ma et al. 2010b) promote breast cancer metastasis. The
recent finding that reduction in the expression of a tumor

suppressor by a mere 20% can promote the development
of cancer (Alimonti et al. 2010) suggests that screens with
sponges, which may alter target gene expression to a similar
extent, could be generally informative.
A related experiment is the application of a sponge to
mimic the genetic state of patients with a genomic deletion
of a particular miRNA or miRNA cluster. For example, the
miR-15a-16-1 cluster is located within a region of chromosome 13q14 that is frequently deleted in leukemia, prostate
cancer, and other malignancies (Bottoni et al. 2005; Bonci
et al. 2008; Bandi et al. 2009; Hanlon et al. 2009; Corthals
et al. 2010; Gatt et al. 2010). Bonci et al. and Gatt et al. used
lentiviral GFP sponges with sites for miR-15a and miR-16,
respectively, and tested transduced human prostate cancer
and multiple myeloma cell lines by xenograft assay. In both
cases the miR-15/16-inhibited cancers developed larger,
more invasive tumors than their negative controls; in the
multiple myeloma study, the animals showed substantially
decreased survival, from a median of 80 to 31 d. Analysis of
the tumors implicated several signaling pathways in which
the miR-15/16 family acts to suppress survival, proliferation, and invasiveness (Gatt et al. 2010).
Another instance of a disease-associated miRNA cluster
deletion occurs in the 5q- subtype of myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) (Starczynowski et al. 2010). In this case
the miRNAs in the cluster, miR-145 and miR-146a, have different seeds. To model the partial loss of these two miRNAs
in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, Starczynowski
et al. used a combination sponge containing eight to nine
bulged sites for each miRNA. Cells transduced with retroviral YFP sponges were transplanted into lethally irradiated
recipient mice, and were mixed with wild-type cells to
mimic the chimerism of human 5q- patients. Eight weeks
post-transplantation, the animals’ blood cells manifested
most of the features of MDS. Observation over the long
term proved the benefit of including a fluorescent reporter
in the competition assay: Over the course of several months,
YFP+ cells were depleted from the blood of the spongetransduced (but not vector control) recipients, yet thrombocytosis was still evident, indicating a cell nonautonomous
effect of miRNA depletion. This correlated with an increased serum IL-6 concentration attributable to the
derepression of miR-146 target gene TRAF6. Sustained,
systemic phenotypes may result from transient miRNA
perturbation in a subset of cells if secreted cytokines
operate in a positive feedback loop, as in the recently
described inflammatory cascade driven by IL6, let-7
down-regulation, and NF-kB (Iliopoulos et al. 2009). As
in the case of miR-15a-16-1 depletion in cancer, the ability
of the stable sponge to partially knock down miRNA
activity provides a good mimic for the partial loss of
miRNA expression in patients with a heterozygous deletion. The miR-145-146a miRNA cluster was shown to be
haploinsufficient in conferring protection against disease
(Starczynowski et al. 2010).

IN VIVO APPLICATIONS FOR miRNA SPONGES
Delivery of sponge constructs to tissue in live mice is feasible
with the use of viral vectors. Carè et al. used an adenoviral
eGFP sponge to inhibit miR-133 in cardiac myocytes in vivo
in a mouse model of cardiac hypertrophy (Carè et al. 2007).
Du et al. used a lentiviral miR-326 sponge with tropism for
CD4+ T-cells and delivered it to the blood system by a tailvein injection of mice with experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis.
Sponge treatment reduced the development of autoimmune
IL-17 secreting TH-17 cells and ameliorated the histological
signs of EAE (Du et al. 2009). Adeno-associated virus (AAV)
vectors are another delivery option suitable for long-term
sponge treatment: They can infect nondividing cells and give
continuous high expression from a nonrandom integration
site (Kotin et al. 1990). Krol et al. used an AAV vector to
deliver sponges to mice subretinally. In this case, the eGFP
sponge was driven by the rhodopsin promoter to allow for
specific expression in photoreceptor cells, and each animal
received a combination sponge for three light-regulated
miRNAs (miR-182, -96, and -183) in one eye and an empty
control vector (lacking miRNA binding sites) in the other
(Krol et al. 2010). Three weeks post-injection, retinas were
isolated and dissected into retinal layers using laser capture
microdissection for eGFP-expressing cells. Western blotting
revealed strong derepression for the target glutamate transporter SLC1A1.
The first transgenic organisms made to express miRNA
sponges were plants (Franco-Zorrilla et al. 2007). These
incorporated a single bulged binding site for the miRNA of
interest in the context of an overexpressed noncoding RNA,
and successfully generated phenotypes opposite those of the
corresponding miRNA-overexpressing plants.
Stable, germline miRNA sponge expression in an animal
model organism was first achieved in Drosophila using the
Gal4-UAS (Upstream Activation Sequence) system (Loya
et al. 2009; see Fig. 2). The sponge constructs consist of five
UAS elements, a fluorescent reporter, and ten bulged
miRNA binding sites in the 39 UTR. Gal4 expressed from
a tissue-specific promoter drives high expression of the
sponge transgene. These inhibitors were able to completely
suppress a neomorphic phenotype caused by an overexpressed miRNA in the eye, and to largely rescue expression
of a target UTR reporter regulated by an endogenous
miRNA in the wing imaginal disc. Hypomorphic phenotypes
were enhanced by means of a sensitized background: the
heterozygous miRNA deletion mutant, which has a reduced
level of the miRNA but no detectable phenotype on its own.
In this background, the sponge transgenics could phenocopy
miRNA-null mutant flies. Varying the number of transgene
copies also modulated the inhibitory effect, which could be
used in combination with the miRNA genetic background to
generate allelic series. The power of the Gal4 inducible
system to dissect a null phenotype was shown by inhibiting

Dissection of a complex phenotype using tissue-specific sponges. A
developmental defect in the axonal branching and synaptic boutons of
neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) was observed in the miR-8 knockout
(second panel) and in miR-8 heterozygous flies expressing a miR-8
sponge inhibitor specifically in muscle ( fourth panel). Wild-type
appearance of the NMJ is seen in the miR-8 heterozygote ( first panel)
and in miR-8 heterozygous flies expressing a miR-8 sponge specifically
in neurons (third panel). Sponge expression is indicated by GFP
fluorescence (shown in green).

a miRNA’s activity in specific subtypes of cells. It is known
that the miR-8 knockout has neuromuscular junction defects; activating the expression of a miR-8 sponge specifically
in neurons or in muscle cells revealed the locally required
activity (and regulation of the target gene Ena) in the postsynaptic muscle cell, even though miR-8 is present in both
pre- and post-synaptic cells. The ability to probe the miRNA
function in restricted subsets of cells could be critical, as
there are cases of miRNA–target interactions restricted to
one cell type; an extreme example is miR-273 repressing the
transcription factor die-1 in the right chemosensory ASE
neuron, and lsy-6 repressing cog-1 in the left chemosensory
ASE neuron in Caenorhabditis elegans (Chang et al. 2004).
OUTLOOK
Transgenic vertebrates expressing sponges are a work in
progress. The recent development of the Tol2 transposon
system and various Gal4 strains should facilitate the introduction of sponge transgenes for tissue-specific expression in zebrafish (Asakawa and Kawakami 2008). In the
mouse, an inducible sponge could be created by means
of the Cre-lox system (to remove a transcriptional stop
cassette with tissue-specific recombinase expression) or with
a tet-responsive element driving the sponge and tissuespecific reverse tet transactivator (rtTA) expression in combination with feeding the animal doxycycline. A sensitized
background of DGCR8 and/or Dicer heterozygosity, which

MicroRNA sponges: Progress and possibilities

shows partially reduced levels for some miRNAs (Murchison
et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2007), might enhance the loss of
function. It should be noted, however, that the Dicer
heterozygous state can accelerate the development of tumors
in mouse models (Kumar et al. 2009). It remains to be
shown whether in vivo sponge expression will provide a
faithful alternative to genetic knockouts of miRNA families.
For the miR-15/16 and miR-144/451 clusters, their respective roles as suppressors of tumor growth and promoters of
erythropoiesis are supported by deletion experiments (Klein
et al. 2010; Rasmussen et al. 2010). For miR-133 on the
other hand, the knockout mouse does not develop cardiac
hypertrophy (Liu et al. 2008) as is observed when a viral
sponge construct or antagomirs are delivered to the heart
(Carè et al. 2007). Further experiments will be necessary to
clarify this discrepancy and to prove the utility of the sponge
method in vivo.
