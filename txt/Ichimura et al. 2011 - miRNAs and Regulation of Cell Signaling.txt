MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by
binding to target mRNAs in a sequence-speciﬁc manner. A large number
of genes appear to be the target of miRNAs, and an essential role for
miRNAs in the regulation of various conserved cell signaling cascades,
such as mitogen-activated protein kinase, Notch and Hedgehog, is emerging. Extensive studies have also revealed the spatial and temporal regulation of miRNA expression by various cell signaling cascades. The insights
gained in such studies support the idea that miRNAs are involved in the
highly complex network of cell signaling pathways. In this minireview, we
present an overview of these complex networks by providing examples of
recent ﬁndings.

Introduction
In higher organisms, the regulation of the transcriptome is extremely complicated. Traditionally, regulation of the transcriptome referred mainly to the
activation or repression of gene expression by transcription factors. However, gene expression in higher
organisms is now known to be controlled by a multilayered regulatory network that includes epigenetic
modiﬁcation of the genome and post-translational
modiﬁcation of gene products. The discovery of
microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate gene expression
post-transcriptionally, has added to the complexity of
transcriptional regulation. At present, the expression of
miRNAs can be proﬁled using various available platforms, which are based on microarrays, high-throughput sequencing or quantitative real-time PCR. Many
studies have reported that miRNAs show speciﬁc spatiotemporal patterns of expression. Expression proﬁling

studies have identiﬁed miRNAs that are speciﬁc to particular organs or cell lines and have revealed an inverse
correlation between the expression of a miRNA and
that of its target mRNAs [1]. Several previous studies
have revealed that miRNAs play an important role in
various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and development [2]. The negative regulation of gene expression by miRNAs has been
reported to contribute to the ﬁne regulation of important physiological and pathological responses, such as
oligodendrocyte cell differentiation [3], epigenetic modiﬁcation [4] and DNA damage response [5], as well as
embryonic stem cell function and fate [6]. Further studies have demonstrated that a large number of miRNAs
are under the control of various important signal transduction cascades. These miRNAs appear to contribute
to the regulation of different signaling pathways via the

repression of their target genes, which results in the regulation and modulation of signal transduction [7].
However, the precise mechanisms that regulate miRNA
expression remain unclear.
In this minireview, we describe the role of miRNAs
with respect to the complicated regulation of the transcriptome and signal transduction. Although miRNAs
and well-established cell signaling pathways have been
the subject of recent reviews [7–10], few have focused
upon the role of miRNAs in regulatory network of
various cell signaling pathways. We summarize the
current knowledge of the interdependence of miRNA
and cell signaling pathways, which results in highly
complicated networks for the regulation of the transcriptome. Current ﬁndings on the role of miRNAs in
cardiac diseases [11] and recent discoveries involving
the miRNA–epigenetics regulatory network [12] are
reviewed in the accompanying minireviews.

miRNAs are involved in various signal
cascades
First, we focus on the roles of miRNAs in various conserved signaling pathways. Many miRNAs are induced
by the action of conserved signaling pathways but, in
turn, the induced miRNAs regulate these pathways by
repressing the expression of components of the signaling pathways and, in some cases, components of other
signaling pathways, thus forming a complex regulatory
network (Fig. 1).
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is a highly conserved module that is
involved in various cellular functions, including cell
proliferation, differentiation and migration [13].
Recently, the mechanisms of transcription and the functional roles of miRNAs associated with MAPK signaling have been revealed. miR-21 is one of the most
interesting examples of an miRNA that is associated
with the MAPK signaling pathway. Thum et al. [14]
reported that miR-21 regulates the extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) ⁄ MAPK signaling pathway in
cardiac ﬁbroblasts [14]. The expression of miR-21 is
increased selectively in ﬁbroblasts of the failing heart,
which augments ERK ⁄ MAPK activity through the
inhibition of sprouty homolog 1, a negative regulator
of MAPK [15]. Furthermore, it has been reported that
miR-21 is upregulated during cardiac hypertrophic
growth and represses the expression of Sprouty 2
(Spry2), which negatively regulates ERK1 ⁄ 2 [16].
Hence, miR-21 increases the basal activity of ERK1 ⁄ 2
by repressing Spry2. Recently, Huang et al. [17]
reported that the expression of miR-21 is upregulated
via the ERK1 ⁄ 2 pathway upon stimulation of

miRNAs and cell signaling

HER2 ⁄ neu signaling and that miR-21 suppresses the
metastasis suppressor protein PDCD4 (programmed
cell death 4) in breast cancer cells. The expression of
miR-21 is also upregulated by overexpression of other
ERK1 ⁄ 2 activators, such as RASV12 and ID-1, in
HER2 ⁄ neu-negative breast cancer cells. Moreover, Fujita et al. [18] have reported the activation of miR-21
expression by 4b-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in
HL60 cells [18]. The transcription factor activation protein 1 (AP-1) triggers the expression of miR-21 through
binding to several AP-1 binding sites that are found in
the promoter of the gene for miR-21. Taken together,
these studies suggest that miR-21 acts as a positivefeedback regulator of the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway because miR-21 is both induced by the activation
of ERK1 ⁄ 2 and enhances the activity of ERK1 ⁄ 2 by
repressing negative regulators of the ERK ⁄ MAPK signaling pathway.
Some other miRNAs are also reported to be induced
by the MAPK signaling pathway. In the human B-cell
line Ramos, miR-155 is induced by signaling by the
B-cell receptor through the ERK and c-Jun N-terminal
kinase pathways but not by the p38 pathway. The
induction of miR-155 depends on a conserved AP-1
site that is approximately 40 bp upstream from the site
of initiation of miR-155 transcription [19]. We previously reported that simulation with nerve growth factor induced the expression of miR-221 and miR-222 in
PC12 cells, and that this induction is dependent on
sustained activation of the ERK1 ⁄ 2 pathway [20].
Furthermore, the induction of miR-34a depends on the
activation of ERK1 ⁄ 2 in K562 cells [21,22]. We have
demonstrated that the activation of MEK ⁄ ERK signaling by 4b-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induces the
expression of miR-34a, which then inhibits MEK1
expression, and leads to the repression of cell proliferation during megakaryocytic differentiation in K562
cells [21]. In addition, miR-34c is induced under the
control of both p53 and p38-MAPK, and prevents
Myc-dependent DNA replication by targeting c-Myc
[23]. Kawashima et al. [24] reported that brain-derived
neurotrophic factor upregulates miR-132 expression
via the ERK-MAPK pathway, which results in the
upregulation of glutamate receptors in cultured cortical
neurons. These studies indicate that many miRNAs
are involved in the MAPK signaling pathway and
these miRNAs have important roles in various cellular
functions. Because a single miRNA usually targets
many genes, the inﬂuence of miRNAs on the components of different signaling pathways could be complex. Many studies in various model organisms,
including Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, have
provided evidence to support this scenario.

The Notch signaling pathway plays an essential
role in a variety of biological processes in multicellular organisms. In Drosophila, two large families of
Notch target genes are clustered at two genomic locations. These families are named the bearded and
enhancer of split complexes. These Notch target
genes contain conserved motifs, which are named the
GY-box, Brd-box and K-box, in their 3¢ UTR. The
members of three different families of miRNAs
(miR-2, miR-4, miR-7, miR-11 and miR-79) have
been shown to regulate the Notch target genes, negatively, by binding to these motifs. This negative regulation prevents the aberrant activation of Notch
signaling [25]. In C. elegans, miR-61 is a direct
transcriptional target of lin-12 ⁄ Notch. In addition,
miR-61 targets Vav-1, which is a negative regulator
of LIN-12, and hence functions in a positive-feedback
manner [26].
A steroid receptor signaling pathway in ﬂies is also
reported to be regulated by an miRNA. Ecdysone
receptor (EcR) signaling constitutes an autoregulatory
loop, in which the activation of EcR induces the
expression of EcR itself. miR-14 targets EcR mRNA
and modulates this loop. Interestingly, EcR signaling
reciprocally regulates transcription of the genes for
miR-14 and EcR. This prevents activation of the loop
by transient transcriptional noise [27].
The Hippo signaling pathway, which is involved in
the control of tissue growth, has been studied extensively in Drosophila and recently emerged as an
important contributor to turmorigenesis in vertebrates. The Drosophila miRNA bantam is a direct
transcriptional target of the Hippo signaling pathway,
and it has been shown to promote growth and inhibit
apoptosis [28,29]. The Drosophila miR-278 plays
a role in the control of energy homeostasis. This
miRNA is also known to target and regulate a component of the Hippo signaling pathway [30,31]. However, no homologs of bantam or miR-278 are found
in vertebrates and no functionally equivalent miRNAs
have been found to date. In humans, miR-372 and
miR-373, which have been implicated as oncogenes in
tumors of testicular germ cells, have been reported to
target and regulate LATS2, which is a homolog of a
component of the Hippo signaling pathway [32].
An interesting ﬁnding concerning the biogenesis of
miRNAs has been reported with respect to signaling by
members of the transforming growth factor b (TGF-b)
family [33]. Receptor-regulated SMADs (R-smads) are
involved in the processing of pri-miRNAs. Stimulation
by an appropriate ligand causes the recruitment of
R-smads to speciﬁc pri-miRNAs that are bound to
the Drosha–DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8

miRNAs and cell signaling

complex and RNA helicase p68. The recruitment of
the R-smads stimulates the production of these miRNAs and thus represses the expression of their target
genes. TGF-b signaling is known to be involved in
the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). The
transcription factors ZEB1 and ZEB2 are downstream mediators of TGF-b signaling and negatively
regulate the expression of E-cadherin. The miR-200
family is reported to target ZEB1 and ZEB2, which
results in the inhibition of EMT in vertebrate cell
lines [34–36]. The miR-200 family is markedly
decreased in cells that have undergone EMT as a
result of stimulation with TGF-b [35]. Interestingly,
ZEB1 reciprocally represses the expression of the
miR-200 cluster and hence promotes EMT in a feedforward manner [37].
The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has a pivotal
role in animal development and functions as a master
regulator of cerebellar granule cell progenitors (GPCs).
Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common pediatric
brain malignancy and is caused by the disruption of
Hh signaling. Microarray analysis of human MBs with
high levels of Hh signaling identiﬁed miRNAs that
had been downregulated. Some of these miRNAs
(miR-125b, miR-326 and miR-324-5p) target activator
components of the Hh signaling pathway and suppress
Hh signaling, which suggests that these miRNAs are
involved in MB. miR-324-5p also targets a downstream transcriptional regulator of Hh signaling and,
interestingly, is located in a genomic region whose
deletion is associated with MB. Moreover, the abovementioned miRNAs are upregulated during GPC differentiation, which suggests that they might function
in vivo by inhibiting Hh activity during the differentiation of GPCs [38].
With respect to the Wnt signaling pathway, a screening assay has identiﬁed miRNAs that modulate Wnt
signaling [39]. In Drosophila, miR-8 negatively regulates Wnt signaling at multiple levels, targeting the
downstream component T cell factor and two
upstream positive components, including Wntless,
which is required for the secretion of Wnt. Mammalian
homologs of miR-8 were also shown to inhibit Wnt
signaling in a cell culture model [39].
Taken together, the results show that the transcriptional hierarchy downstream of various important signal cascades appears to include multiple miRNAs.
miRNAs may mediate cross-talk between various signaling pathways via the repression of their target genes.
Indeed, several examples of feedback regulation that
involve miRNAs have been reported. Below, we attempt
to summarize our recent understanding of feedback
regulation of signal cascades that involve miRNAs.

miRNAs act as feedback regulators of
signal cascades
miR-34a is one of the most interesting examples of an
miRNA that is associated with a complicated regulatory mechanism of gene expression. Initially, miR-34a
was identiﬁed as a putative tumor suppressor that regulates the E2F signaling pathway and induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells [40]. Moreover, it was
reported that the direct transactivation of miR-34a
contributes to p53-mediated apoptosis in various
tumors [41–44]. Subsequently, SIRT1, which is a regulator of p53 activation, was reported to be a target of
miR-34a, which suggests that miR-34a participates in
a double-negative-feedback loop and contributes to the
ﬁne-tuning of p53 activity [45,46]. miR-34a is also
induced by a p53-independent pathway: ELK1, which
is a member of the ETS family of transcription factors,
mediates the induction of miR-34a during cell senescence caused by the constitutive activation of the
kinase B-RAF [47]. In addition, both ourselves [21]
and Navarro et al. [22] identiﬁed TPA-dependent
transactivation of miR-34a during megakaryocytic
differentiation of K562, which is a p53-null chronic
myelocytic leukemia cell line. The ﬁnding that TPAinduced upregulation of miR-34a depends on the activation of the ERK signal cascade and that miR-34a
downregulates MEK1, which is one of the main regulators of ERK signaling, indicates that miR-34a is
involved in negative-feedback regulation of the ERK
signal cascade. These studies indicate that a complicated regulatory network maintains the expression of
the signaling molecules and miR-34a; at least three signalling pathways affect the expression of miR-34a and
two of their components are negatively regulated by
miR-34a (Fig. 2).
Some other mutual regulatory relationships between
miRNAs and various signaling pathways have been
reported. Xu et al. [48] proposed the existence of a
double-negative-feedback loop controlled by miR-145
and three factors that regulate self-renewal and pluripotency: OCT4, SOX2 and KLF4. Castellano et al.
[49] revealed that the expression of estrogen receptor-a
(ERa) is autoregulated by miR-18a, -19b and -20b,
which in turn are upregulated by the activation of
ERa. This mechanism of regulation provides a wide
range of coordinated cellular responses to estrogen
[49]. In the self-renewal of neural stem cells, miR-9
acts with the nuclear receptor TLX to provide a
feedback regulatory loop that controls the balance
between neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation [50]. miR-9 is induced by lipopolysaccharide via
the activation of the receptor TLR4 and also is

reported that members of a cluster of miRNAs, called
miR-17-92, form a negative-feedback loop that is
involved in cancer. The expression of miR-17-92 is
induced by the transcription factors E2F and Myc but,
in turn, miR-17-92 downregulates the expression of
E2F and Myc [52]. In tumor progression, the transcription repressors ZEB1 and SIP1 and the miR-200
family of miRNAs provide a double-negative-feedback
loop that regulates the phenotype of cells [53]. Furthermore, in human breast tumors and cell lines, miR-175p and miR-20a are induced in a manner that depends
on cyclin D1 and repress the expression of cyclin D1.
Hence, miR-17-5p ⁄ 20a and cyclin D1 form a feedback
loop and have a regulatory role in oncogenesis
[54]. miR-206 and ERa repress the expression of each
other reciprocally in the human breast cancer cell line
MCF-7 in a double-negative-feedback loop [55].
Various other examples of feedback regulation that
involve miRNAs have been reported for several important biological processes. The miRNAs that are known
to be involved in feedback regulation, their target
genes and the signal cascades affected are summarized
in Table 1. Such studies demonstrate the highly complex regulation of signal cascades and the physiological
and pathological roles of miRNAs. Hence, further
investigations aiming to elucidate the mechanisms
and signal cascades that regulate the expression of
miRNAs should reveal complicated and multilayered
cell signaling networks.

Conclusions
Considering the broad range of miRNA targets, it is
possible that regulatory networks for the control of
gene transcription will become much more complex as

additional research is carried out [56,57]. Yu et al. [58]
investigated the cross-talk between miRNAs and transcription factors using mathematical modeling and
revealed the existence of two classes of miRNAs with
distinct network topological properties. Although this
analysis demonstrated extensive interaction between
miRNAs and transcription factors, biological validation of mathematical models is very challenging. However, recent advances with respect to high-throughput
sequencing technologies have enabled, in combination
with chromatin immunoprecipitation, the cost-effective
functional genome-wide investigation of transcription
factor binding sites [59]. Argonaute high-throughput
sequencing of RNAs from in vivo cross-linking and
immunoprecipitation also provides genome-wide interaction maps for miRNAs and mRNAs, which enables
comprehensive identiﬁcation of miRNA targets [60].
By integrating mRNA and miRNA sequence and
expression data with these comparative genomic data,
we will be able to gain global, and yet speciﬁc, insights
into the function and evolution of a broad layer of
post-transcriptional control. These comprehensive
analyses will yield many additional examples of functionally relevant regulatory roles of miRNAs in cell
signaling pathways. The elucidation of these examples
will clarify novel functions and biological roles of
miRNAs.
