Soon after its discovery, microRNA-9 (miR-9) attracted the attention of neurobiologists,
since it is one of the most highly expressed microRNAs in the developing and adult
vertebrate brain. Functional analyses in different vertebrate species have revealed a
prominent role of this microRNA in balancing proliferation in embryonic neural progenitor
populations. Key transcriptional regulators such as FoxG1, Hes1 or Tlx, were identified as
direct targets of miR-9, placing it at the core of the gene network controlling the progenitor
state. Recent data also suggest that this function could extend to adult neural stem cells.
Other studies point to a role of miR-9 in differentiated neurons. Moreover miR-9 has
been implicated in human brain pathologies, either displaying a protective role, such as
in Progeria, or participating in disease progression in brain cancers. Altogether functional
studies highlight a prominent feature of this highly conserved microRNA, its functional
versatility, both along its evolutionary history and across cellular contexts.

microRNAs are small regulatory RNAs that modulate, generally
negatively, the translation and/or stability of mRNA targets
through complementary binding to their 3 untranslated region
(3 UTR; Bartel, 2009). microRNA genes are transcribed as
primary transcripts (pri-miR), which are cleaved in the nucleus
to generate precursor transcripts (pre-miR) (Yang and Lai, 2011).
One characteristic of pre-miR is that they form a secondary
hairpin structure. Pre-miR are exported to the cytoplasm where
they are further cleaved by the enzyme Dicer. This cleavage gives
rise to a duplex of short RNA strands (the 5 and 3 strands),
one of which is then loaded into the RNA-induced silencing
complex (RISC). The discovery of microRNAs unraveled a new
layer of complexity of gene regulatory networks. Computational
and experimental approaches have demonstrated that a single
microRNA can regulate the expression of hundreds of mRNA
targets. However, despite their large spectrum of action, loss
of microRNA function often results in paradoxically subtle
phenotypes, some of which are only apparent in a sensitized
genomic or environmental context (Li et al., 2009). In the light of
these findings, microRNAs are hypothesized to confer robustness
to developmental programs, and to facilitate transitions between
different cellular states (Takacs and Giraldez, 2010; Ebert and
Sharp, 2012). Therefore, studying their implication during neurogenesis, which implies the transition of a neural progenitor to
a differentiated neuronal cell, might shed new light on regulation
of this process. microRNA-9 (miR-9) captured the attention of
neurobiologists because of its high sequence conservation in
bilaterian animals, and its high and specific expression in the
central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates. As its function and
spectrum of action begins to be unraveled, this microRNA proves
to be highly versatile, exerting various and sometimes opposite
activities depending on the species and cellular context.

EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF miR-9 GENES
STRUCTURAL EVOLUTION OF THE miR-9 GENE FAMILY

The miR-9 gene is ancient in animal evolution, as it appeared
at the transition towards triploblasty (Wheeler et al., 2009). The
genome of some extant animal species contains several copies of
this gene (Figure 1A). In Vertebrates, the amplification of miR-9
genes parallels the whole genome duplication events that occurred
in the phylum and thus likely results from them. Independent
duplications events also occurred in other phyla such as arthropods. This led in particular to the presence of five miR-9 genes
in Drosophila, three of which are clustered in the same gene
complex (Lai et al., 2004). The level of sequence conservation
of pre-miR-9 among animals is strikingly high, in particular
at the level of both 5 and 3 mature microRNA strands. For
instance the 5 strand of drosophila miR-9a gene is identical to
the one in human genes (Figure 1B). The retention in vertebrate
genomes of multiple independent copies of a gene generating
identical microRNA forms is quite surprising. It could be linked
to differential expression of paralogous miR-9 genes, leading to
subfunctionalization between copies (Berezikov, 2011).
There is in contrast a high variability in strand preference
among miR-9 copies (see Figure 1A). Upon association of
microRNA duplexes with the RISC complex, only one strand is
retained while the other is discarded. For most microRNAs, one
of the two arms, either the 5 or 3 , is preferentially selected at
this step (sometimes called guide strand), while the other tends
to be used more infrequently (passenger strand or star strand). In
the case of miR-9 genes, the guide strand can be generated either
from the 5 (miR-9-5p) or the 3 arm (miR-9-3p) depending on
the gene considered. In deuterostomes, miR-9 genes always show
a preferential usage of the 5 strand (miR-9-5p), although the 3
strand (miR-9-3p) is still present at detectable levels. This explains

preferred microRNA strand is represented in red, while the non-preferred (or
“star”) is represented in black. No miR-9 gene has been recovered so far
from genomes of cnidarian species, such as the sea anemone or hydra,
suggesting that the emergence of a miR-9 gene occurred at the transition
towards triploblasty. At the origin of jawed vertebrates, two rounds of whole

genome duplications (WGD) have occurred. An additional WGD occurred in
the teleost lineage. These duplication events likely account for the presence
of multiple miR-9 genes in vertebrates. Eutherian mammals lost one class of
miR-9 genes (corresponding to miR-9-4, also called miR-9b). (B) Alignment of

why miR-9-5p is often referred to as miR-9, while miR-9-3p is
referred to as miR-9*. In Drosophila and nematode the strand bias
is different for the different copies (Lim et al., 2003; Lai et al.,
2004). For instance, for 3 of the 5 fly genes (miR-9a, miR-9b and
miR-9c) the preferred strand is the 5 strand, while it is the 3
strand in the other two genes (miR-4 and miR-79) (Lai et al.,
2004). The bias in strand usage in this species is incidentally
reflected in the gene nomenclature. Yet a different situation is
observed in the marine snail Aplysia californica. In this species
of mollusk there is only one miR-9 gene with no preferential
strand usage, mature microRNAs being equally recovered from
both 5 and 3 strands of the duplex (Rajasethupathy et al.,
2009). Altogether these data show that strand preference in miR-9
genes has been quite labile during the course of evolution which
certainly influenced the regulation and functional evolution of the
gene family.

FUNCTIONAL EVOLUTION OF miR-9: IMPLICATION OF miR-9a IN FLY
NEUROGENESIS

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

Large scale analysis of microRNAs expression revealed that miR-9
is highly enriched in both the developing and mature nervous
system of vertebrates (Miska et al., 2004; Sempere et al., 2004;
Wienholds et al., 2005; Heimberg et al., 2010). Functional analyses
in vertebrate model species have highlighted a prominent role of
miR-9 in regulating the behavior of neural progenitors, as well
as the differentiation of some neuronal populations (see further
sections). The expression of miR-9/9* in human fibroblasts, in
synergy with miR-124, is sufficient to convert them into neurons,
placing miR-9/9* at the core of the gene network controlling the
neural fate (Yoo et al., 2011). The presence of miR-9 in nervous
cells might be an ancestral characteristic of bilaterian animals,
as it has been observed in cephalochordate and annelid species
(Christodoulou et al., 2010; Candiani et al., 2011).
However, in Drosophila, although miR-9a does influence
the development of peripheral nervous system sensory organs,
its function is encoded negatively, through miR-9 restricted

expression in non-neural epidermal cells (Li et al., 2006). In wildtype flies sensory precursor (SOP) cells are specified in invariable
numbers among ectodermal epithelial cells in a two-step process
(Skeath and Carroll, 1994; Figure 2A). First, small groups of cells,
the proneural clusters, acquire neural competence via the induction of proneural genes encoding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
proteins such as Achaete and Scute (Ac/Sc). Among cells of the

FIGURE 2 | Role of miR-9 in the development of drosophila sensory
organs. (A) Different steps of the formation of sensory organs. Among
the ectodermal tissue, groups of cells, called proneural clusters (green),
acquire neural competence via the induction of proneural genes. The
dLMO protein participates in the acquisition of this competence. Among
competent cells, one will maintain high levels of proneural genes
expression, notably of the sense gene, and become a SOP cell (SOP,
yellow). Concomitantly the neural fate is inhibited in the neighboring cells
(non-SOP, blue). The SOP cell later divides to give rise to a sensory organ.
miR-9a is present in all ectodermal cells except the SOP cell, and inhibits
dLMO and Sens protein expression. (B) Role of miR-9a in SOP cell

proneural cluster, as a consequence of a lateral inhibition mechanism via the Notch signaling pathway, one cell will express higher
levels of proneural genes and become a SOP (Figure 2B). Mutant
miR-9a flies display a few ectopic sensory neurons in the embryo
and in the adult, a phenotype resulting from the specification of
an excessive number of SOP cells (Li et al., 2006). miR-9a mutant
phenotype is however quite mild, and its penetrance is influenced

cells. This interaction leads to Notch cleavage, which releases Notch
intracellular domain (Nintra ) in non-SOP cells. Nintra interacts with the
transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless Su(H), which induces E(spl)
gene expression. E(spl) genes encode transcriptional repressors inhibiting
the expression of proneural genes and in particular sens. In the SOP cell,
in the absence of Nintra , Su(H) has an inhibitory effect on the transcription
of E(spl) genes which allows for the expression of sens. Sens activates
the expression of proneural genes of the ac/scute complex (ac/sc) which
specify the SOP cell fate. miR-9a, expressed in non-SOP cells, prevents
ectopic expression of sens, thereby conferring robustness to the
developmental program. Other genes of the miR-9 family might also play a
role here, as miR-4 and miR-79 have been shown to regulate the
expression Notch target genes, such as E(spl) or Brd.

by the genetic background (Li et al., 2006; Bejarano et al.,
2010). miR-9a is therefore not a strong deterministic factor, but
rather confers robustness to this developmental program, a role
frequently undertaken by microRNAs (Ebert and Sharp, 2012).
Remarkably miR-9a influences both steps of SOP specification,
through the inhibition of two major targets, drosophila LIM-only
(dLMO) and senseless (sens) (Figure 2A; Li et al., 2006; Biryukova
et al., 2009; Bejarano et al., 2010). dLMO encodes a component of
a multimeric transcriptional complex shown to participate in the
initial induction of ac/sc expression in proneural clusters (Ramain
et al., 2000; Asmar et al., 2008). Like miR-9a mutants, dLMO
gain of function mutants display extra sensory bristles (Asmar
et al., 2008). These dLMO mutants lack large portions of dLMO
3 UTR, which contains a miR-9a binding site, conserved among
Drosophila species, and through which miR-9a was shown to
directly repress the production of the dLMO protein (Biryukova
et al., 2009; Bejarano et al., 2010). sens is first expressed in
proneural cluster cells and later accumulates at high levels in the
prospective SOP (Nolo et al., 2000). Sens acts as a binary switch
factor: present at low levels in proneural cluster cells, it limits the
expression of ac; in contrast, high levels of Sens activates proneural genes expression in the SOP cell, contributing to its specification (Jafar-Nejad et al., 2003). Similar to dLMO, sens 3 UTR
harbors miR-9a putative binding sites and mediates an interaction
with miR-9a, which impacts on Sens protein levels (Li et al., 2006).
Heterozygosity of either dLMO or sens can partially rescue the
excessive number of bristles in miR-9a mutants, demonstrating
that de-repression of these targets contributes to this phenotype (Bejarano et al., 2010). Little is known however about the
upstream regulators of miR-9a in flies and how its expression
becomes restricted to non-neural cells. The only known miR-9a
regulator is the RNA-binding protein transactive response DNAbinding protein 43 (TDP-43), which seems to stabilize miR-9a
pri-miR (Li et al., 2013). However, the function of other miR-9
genes, and in particular of miR-4 and miR-79, which use the
opposite strand, has yet to be directly addressed in drosophila.
Both miR-4 and miR-79 have been shown to interact with Bearded
(Brd) box, a sequence motif previously identified as enriched on
the 3 UTR of Notch target genes such as Enhancer-of-split (E(spl))
or Brd (Lai and Posakony, 1997; Lai et al., 2005; Figure 2B). One
could thus hypothesize a role of these microRNAs in neurogenesis
through the deregulation of Notch target genes.
In sharp contrast with the situation in vertebrates, studies in
drosophila thus point to an anti-neural role of miR-9a: expressed
in non-neural epithelial cells, miR-9a restricts the number of
specified SOP by dampening the expression of the proneural
genes dLMO and sens. This suggests that, despite the fact that
miR-9a sequence is strictly identical to its vertebrate counterparts,
its function and its set of targets have been profoundly remodeled
during evolution.

miR-9 REGULATION OF NEURAL PROGENITORS

miR-9 expression is preferentially associated with neurogenic
progenitors

The first large scale microRNA expression profiles performed in
vertebrates soon identified miR-9 as a brain enriched microRNA
(Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002; Krichevsky et al., 2003; Miska et al.,
2004; Sempere et al., 2004). In particular, its expression levels
were shown to be dynamically regulated during brain development, and during in vitro induced neurogenesis (Miska et al.,
2004; Sempere et al., 2004; Krichevsky et al., 2006). miR-9*,
derived from the 3 strand of miR-9 genes, is also present at
detectable levels in vertebrate neural tissues. In situ hybridization
analyses in different vertebrate model organisms have revealed
very similar spatiotemporal patterns of miR-9 expression during
(CNS) development (Darnell et al., 2006; Deo et al., 2006; Leucht
et al., 2008; Shibata et al., 2008; Walker and Harland, 2008).
miR-9 expression starts at mid-embryogenesis stages, after the
specification of the major brain subdivisions and the development
of the primary neuronal scaffold. Its expression is first induced
in the telencephalon, and later spreads to more posterior brain
regions and spinal cord. All along the CNS, miR-9 expression
is predominantly associated with ventricular neural progenitors
areas (Darnell et al., 2006; Leucht et al., 2008; Shibata et al.,
2008, 2011; Bonev et al., 2011; Coolen et al., 2012), although
some differentiated neurons also express miR-9, notably in the
dorsal telencephalon and spinal cord (Leucht et al., 2008; Otaegi
et al., 2011; Shibata et al., 2011). Its expression characterizes
active neurogenic areas and its expression is dependent on the
activity of Notch signaling (Coolen et al., 2012). In contrast,
miR-9 seems to be specifically excluded from progenitor pools
located at boundaries between brain compartments, such as the
Midbrain-Hindbrain Boundary (MHB) or rhombomeres boundaries (Figure 3A; Leucht et al., 2008; Coolen et al., 2012). In
these boundary regions, which play a role as late signaling centers, neural progenitors do not enter neurogenesis and remain
undifferentiated over long periods (Kiecker and Lumsden, 2005).
Interestingly, miR-9 expression appears similarly regulated in the
retina. There miR-9 expression is also restricted to late progenitors
(La Torre et al., 2013) and shows a dependence on Notch activity
(Georgi and Reh, 2010). Furthermore it appears to be excluded
from the progenitor pool located at the ciliary marginal zone
in non-mammalian vertebrates (Kapsimali et al., 2007). This
pool maintains undifferentiated progenitors over a long time,
reminiscent of neural tube boundary regions. miR-9 was also
detected in adult brain neurogenic areas, in both fish and mouse
(Deo et al., 2006; Kapsimali et al., 2007; Tozzini et al., 2012), and
in primary cultures of mouse adult stem cells (Zhao et al., 2009).
However a precise characterization of miR-9-positive cells in adult
brains remains to be performed.
Regulation of neural progenitors proliferation by miR-9

miR-9 REGULATION OF NEURAL DEVELOPMENT
In deuterostomes, miR-9 genes demonstrate a strong evolutionary
plasticity, in terms of strand usage and developmental function.
In contrast, studies in vertebrate model species point to highly
conserved functions of miR-9, especially in the regulation of
neural progenitor proliferation.

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

As the expression of miR-9 suggests, functional analyses uncovered a prominent role of miR-9 in the regulation of embryonic
neural progenitors states. In zebrafish embryos, miR-9 was shown
to participate in the late patterning of the midbrain/hindbrain
region. The activity of miR-9 on both sides of the MHB restricts
the extent of the pool of non-neurogenic progenitors located

is expressed in active neurogenic zones. Sagittal section through a

as revealed by in situ hybridization (blue). miR-9 is expressed at the
ventricular zone, and excluded from differentiated neurons expressing the
protein HuC (magenta). Its expression is induced in neurogenic areas,
where the expression of proneural genes such as neurogenin1 (neurog1) is
detected (green). In contrast, miR-9 is excluded specifically from boundary
regions, containing long-lasting neural progenitors, such as the MHB (big
arrowhead) or rhombomere boundaries (small arrowheads). (B) Functional
data suggest that miR-9 promotes the transition from a non-neurogenic
progenitor, expressing high levels of Hes1, to a neurogenic progenitor, in
which Hes1 levels oscillate. The miR-9 expressing neurogenic progenitor is

cues. (C) Scheme representing negative feedback loops between miR-9
and its targets, some of which promoting proliferation (purple) and others

at this boundary (Leucht et al., 2008). However, miR-9 has a
more general influence on the behavior of neurogenic progenitors
along the neural tube. Overexpression of miR-9/9* duplexes in
the zebrafish embryo (Leucht et al., 2008), mouse embryonic
cortex (Zhao et al., 2009), and chick spinal cord (Yoo et al., 2011)
leads to a reduction in the number of proliferating progenitors.
This effect is accompanied by precocious neuronal differentiation
(Leucht et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2009). miR-9/9* was also shown
to promote differentiation of adult neural stem cells in vitro,
albeit only if they were primed for differentiation beforehand
using forskolin or retinoic acid (Zhao et al., 2009). Additionally, infecting human neonatal fibroblasts with lentiviral vectors
containing miR-9/9* and miR-124 induces their conversion into
postmitotic neurons. However, this conversion is dependent on
the expression on all three microRNAs (Yoo et al., 2011). Thus,
these in vitro data show that miR-9 alone is not sufficient to induce
neuronal differentiation. Conversely, miR-9 loss-of-function consistently induces an increased proliferation of embryonic neural
progenitors (Bonev et al., 2011; Shibata et al., 2011; Coolen
et al., 2012) or mouse adult neural stem cells (Zhao et al., 2009).
However neural progenitors resume differentiation even under
miR-9 depletion conditions, their cell cycle exit being only delayed
(Shibata et al., 2011; Coolen et al., 2012). Altogether this data
suggests that miR-9 does not act as a necessary and sufficient
differentiation switch, but rather could favor the transition of
progenitors from a proliferative mode to a neurogenic mode.
Of note, in over-expression experiments or in mouse mutants,
the effects observed result from the combined gain or loss of
both miR-9 strands. In contrast, in depletion experiments using
antisense oligonucleotides, like the one performed in zebrafish
or Xenopus embros, only miR-9 (miR-9-5p) is down-regulated.
The individual role of the other miR-9* (miR-9-3p) has yet to be
assessed. Moreover, in human embryonic stem cell-derived neural
progenitors, and rat embryonic cortical progenitors, miR-9 was
shown to have a completely opposite role (Delaloy et al., 2010).
In this study, inhibition of miR-9 led to a decrease in neural
progenitor proliferation, concomitant with increased migratory
capacities. The different effects observed on neural progenitors in
culture might be linked to a different timing of miR-9 depletion
during in vitro differentiation (Zhao et al., 2009; Delaloy et al.,
2010). These results indicate that miR-9 can inversely impact
the proliferation of neural progenitors depending on the cellular
context. Differential expression of mRNA targets or the synergy
between miR-9 and other mRNA regulating factors could account
for this phenomenon. For instance the RNA binding proteins
Elavl1 and Musashi1 can synergize with miR-9 to increase the
expression of some of its targets (Shibata et al., 2011). A better
appreciation of the spatial and temporal variations of miR-9 function in vivo awaits the development of more refined conditional
knock-down tools.
miR-9 targets in neural progenitors reveal a complex interacting
network

A better understanding of miR-9 function will certainly arise
from the characterization of its set of targets and the analysis
of the impact of these interactions in vivo. In silico algorithms
predict several hundred targets for miR-9, a high figure typical

of ancient microRNAs (Bartel, 2009). So far, only a few of these
interactions have been confirmed in vitro or in vivo, but these
studies have shed light on the complex mode of action of miR-9
in neural progenitors.
A first set of miR-9 targets are members of the Hes gene
family (Leucht et al., 2008; Bonev et al., 2011, 2012; Coolen
et al., 2012). Hes genes are the main Notch signaling effectors
and encode transcriptional repressors (Kageyama et al., 2008).
Expressed in neural progenitors, they inhibit differentiation by
repressing proneural genes such as ascl1, a vertebrate homolog
of Drosophila ac/sc complex genes. Some of them are also highly
expressed at boundaries and help in maintaining slow cycling
non-neurogenic progenitors at these locations (Kageyama et al.,
2008; Stigloher et al., 2008). Among miR-9 targets is her5, which
in zebrafish embryos is specifically expressed at the MHB. In this
area miR-9 restricts the size of the MHB progenitor pool through
repressing her5 while simultaneously limiting the signaling activity of the MHB progenitors by repressing Fibroblast growth factor
(FGF) pathway genes (Leucht et al., 2008). Hes1/her6 genes also
harbor a miR-9 binding site in their 3 UTR, which is conserved
across vertebrates. In zebrafish and frog embryos, target protector
morpholinos (Choi et al., 2007) that block the miR-9 binding
site on the hes1/her6 3 UTR, induce an increased proliferation,
mimicking the effect of miR-9 blockade (Bonev et al., 2011;
Coolen et al., 2012) and thus demonstrate that miR-9 targeting
of this gene is crucial to properly balance progenitor proliferation. Interestingly, Hes1 was previously shown to be expressed
in neural progenitors both at boundary regions and inside brain
compartments. However, live imaging using a Hes1 luciferase
reporter demonstrated that at boundaries, Hes1 expression is
high and stable, whereas it displays ultradian oscillations inside
brain compartments (Shimojo et al., 2008). This difference in
Hes1 expression mode is thought to parallel the non-neurogenic
versus neurogenic properties of these two kinds of progenitors
(Kageyama et al., 2008). In an in vitro model, the dampening
of Hes1 expression by miR-9 was shown to be necessary for
oscillations of Hes1 to occur (Bonev et al., 2012; Tan et al., 2012).
miR-9 could therefore promote a transition towards neurogenesis
via influencing the mode of Hes1 expression.
Several other validated targets of miR-9 are also transcription
factors that were previously shown to promote progenitor proliferation. They include notably the forkhead transcription factor
FoxG1 (Shibata et al., 2008, 2011), the homeobox factor Gsx2
(Shibata et al., 2011), the orphan nuclear receptor Tlx/Nr2e1
(Biryukova et al., 2009; Bonev et al., 2011) and the zinc finger
transcription factor Zic5 (Coolen et al., 2012). The repression
of these transcription factors by miR-9 could explain the antiproliferative effect it exerts in neural progenitors, while their upregulation could participate in miR-9 the depletion phenotype.
Thus in miR-9-2/3 double mutant mice, the clear increase in
FoxG1 and Gsx2 protein levels could contribute to increasing
proliferation of embryonic pallial and subpallial progenitor cells
(Shibata et al., 2011). Moreover, the reduction of proliferation
induced by miR-9 can be rescued by overexpressing TLX, suggesting that the inhibition of this target could participate in this
phenotype (Zhao et al., 2009). Surprisingly however, the levels
of TLX proteins are not up-regulated but down-regulated in

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

miR-9-2/3 double mutant mice (Shibata et al., 2011). This
discrepancy could be linked to the presence of the RNA binding
proteins Elavl1 or Msi1, which were shown in vitro to be able
to convert miR-9 to an activator (Shibata et al., 2011). Alternatively, indirect effects of miR-9 depletion could also explain
the reduction of TLX protein. Zic5 belongs to a family of Zinc
finger transcription factors that act as inhibitors of neuronal
differentiation during development (Aruga, 2004). In vertebrates,
Zic5 mRNA possesses a very conserved binding site for miR-9,
and moreover, in the zebrafish embryonic hindbrain, injection of
a target protector morpholino restricting binding to this site leads
to an increase in progenitor proliferation (Coolen et al., 2012).
Other targets of miR-9 are linked with the epigenetic
machinery, which is subjected to drastic remodeling during the
course of neuronal differentiation. The 3 UTR of repressorelement-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) and the corepressor CoREST, were shown to harbor functional binding sites
for miR-9 and miR-9* respectively (Packer et al., 2008). REST
and CoREST act in a chromatin-bound protein complex, which
recruits histone modifiers to repress the expression of neuronal
genes in neural stem cells and progenitors (Ballas and Mandel,
2005). During neuronal differentiation, the complex is dismantled, which allows for the expression of neuronal genes. During the transition from progenitors to neurons, there is also
an exchange of subunits within the Switch/Sucrose non fermentable (Swi/Snf) chromatin remodeling complex: the subunit
BRG1- and BRM-associated factor 53a (BAF53a) present in neural progenitors is notably replaced by its homologous BAF53b.
Interestingly, miR-9* seems to be able to facilitate this exchange,
via repressing the expression of BAF53a (Yoo et al., 2009). miR-9
can also inhibit the expression of Sirt1, a member of the class III
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent histone
deacetylases (Delaloy et al., 2010). Sirt1 associates with different
repressor complexes and opposite influences of this factor have
been observed during in vitro neurogenesis: Sirt1 can associate
with Hes1 to repress proneural gene expression (Prozorovski et al.,
2008), however, on the other hand, Sirt1 translocation to the
nucleus was also shown to accompany neuronal differentiation of
neural stem cells in vitro and accelerate this process via repressing
Notch targets such as Hes1 (Hisahara et al., 2008). It is therefore
hard to draw a conclusion on the potential functional consequences of miR-9 repression of Sirt1 at this stage. Importantly the
significance of these microRNA-targets interactions remains to be
directly assessed in vivo. Nevertheless they suggest exciting links
between miR-9 and the epigenetic landscape of neural progenitor
cells. Interestingly miR-9 could also participate in remodeling the
microRNAs landscape in neural cells. Indeed miR-9 can inhibit
the pluripotent factors Lin28A and Lin28B, RNA binding proteins
that block the processing of some microRNAs, including let-7
(Eda et al., 2009; La Torre et al., 2013).
miR-9 can promote neural differentiation via the inhibition
of proliferation factors and progenitor specific epigenetic factors.
Surprisingly however, miR-9 was shown to also downregulate
the expression of genes with differentiation promoting activities.
For instance, using target protector morpholinos, a cryptic role
of miR-9 in inhibiting elavl3, a proneural differentiation factor,
was revealed in zebrafish embryos (Coolen et al., 2012). In doing

miR-9 and neurogenesis

this, miR-9 dampens the expression of factors favoring antagonist fates. Thereby it seems to favor an ambivalent progenitor
state, poised to respond to both progenitor maintenance and
commitment cues (Figure 3B). This ambivalent state could possibly correspond to the previously described “oscillating” neurogenic progenitors in which the levels of opposite fate determinants
like Hes1 and Ngn2 oscillate prior to commitment (Kageyama
et al., 2008). Another striking feature emerging from the analyses
of miR-9 targets is that they often exert feedback regulation on
miR-9 (Figure 3C). Transcription of miR-9 genes is repressed by
Nr2e2/Tlx, Hes1 and REST, and its effect on mRNA targets can
be modulated by Elavl proteins, also targeted by this microRNA
(Zhao et al., 2009; Laneve et al., 2010; Shibata et al., 2011;
Bonev et al., 2012). Feedback loops are recurring motifs in gene
regulatory networks involving microRNAs, and they can stabilize
cellular states and provide robustness to developmental programs
(Peláez and Carthew, 2012). Altogether the study of miR-9 targets
point to a role of this microRNA to facilitate, pace and stabilize
the transition of progenitors towards neural differentiation. To
obtain a full picture of its gene network a thorough characterization of miR-9 targets and validation of the impact of individual
interactions should be conducted. This would help understanding the phenotype resulting from its absence, which combines
the sometimes opposite effects of the deregulation of many
mRNAs.
ADDITIONAL ROLES OF miR-9 IN NEURAL DEVELOPMENT: miR-9 IN
POST-MITOTIC NEURONS

A few studies have unraveled additional functions of miR-9 at
later steps of neural development, linked to its expression in some
populations of post-mitotic neurons.
miR-9 is transiently expressed during the differentiation of
spinal cord motoneurons (MN), located in the lateral motor
column and innervating limb muscles, but not in neighboring
MN (Otaegi et al., 2011). These MN are characterized by the
expression of FoxP1 and Isl1/2, both of which are putative targets
of miR-9. In this context, manipulating miR-9 levels impairs
the differentiation and axonal projections of spinal motoneuron
lineages, possibly through a de-regulation of FoxP1 protein levels.
The paralog gene Foxp2 also possesses functional miR-9 binding sites on its 3 UTR. Foxp2 protein is expressed in the embryonic cortex, but its expression starts much later than miR-9.
Furthermore, while miR-9 expression spans most layers of the
cortex, being however enriched in ventricular progenitors, Foxp2
expression is restricted to post-migratory neurons (Shibata et al.,
2011; Clovis et al., 2012). Both miR-9 putative binding sites can
mediate the repression of a reporter transgene by endogenous
miR-9 present in the cortex (Clovis et al., 2012). This suggests that
miR-9 could prevent excessive expression of the protein FoxP2 in
the cortex, which was shown to severely impair neuronal migration. Moreover excessive expression of FoxP2 also compromises
maturation of cortical neurons.
A role of miR-9 in the maturation of cortical neurons was
more directly demonstrated by another study in which miR-9
expression could be detected in axons and dendrites of differentiated neurons (Dajas-Bailador et al., 2012). Moreover, inhibition
of miR-9 in cultured neurons increased axonal length and reduced

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

axonal branching. Specific inhibition of miR-9 binding on the
Map1b 3 UTR both in vitro and in vivo using target protectors
could mimic this effect of miR-9. Thus miR-9 regulates neuronal
maturation through modulating the expression level of this gene,
which is an important regulator of microtubules dynamics.

IMPLICATION OF miR-9 IN HUMAN PATHOLOGIES
miR-9 IN CANCER

Studies in the developing brain demonstrated that miR-9 is deeply
rooted in gene networks controlling the regulation of neural
progenitors proliferation. It is therefore not surprising to see
this microRNA implicated in the progression of brain cancers
such as medulloblastoma and glioblastoma. As in the normal
contexts, this microRNA demonstrates its versatility in the context
of tumors.
Medulloblastomas (MB) are the most frequent form of pediatric brain cancers. They originate from cerebellar progenitors.
miR-9 expression is reduced in MB samples compared to neighboring brain tissues (Ferretti et al., 2009). This could contribute
to disease progression as inhibition of miR-9 in MB cell lines
increases their proliferation. One target of miR-9, the truncated form of the neurotrophin receptor TrkC (t-TrkC), is upregulated in MB and was shown to promote proliferation of
MB cells. The deregulation of t-TrkC following down-regulation
of miR-9 could therefore play a role in sustaining proliferation of MB cells. Conversely a high expression of miR-9 was
detected in a subclass of glioblastoma, the most common but
also the most aggressive type of adult brain tumors (Kim et al.,
2011). Interestingly, miR-9 expression was particularly associated with tumor cells possessing stem-like features (Schraivogel
et al., 2011). These cells, referred to as glioblastoma stem cells
(GSC), are defined by long term self-renewal capacities thus
endowing them with greater potential for cancer initiation and
propagation (Huang et al., 2010). Several studies demonstrate
that these cells are particularly resistant to radiotherapy and
chemotherapy, and are therefore likely responsible for tumor
resistance and recurrence. Reducing miR-9 expression in glioblastoma primary culture leads to a reduction of the number of
cells with in vitro self-renewing potential (Schraivogel et al.,
2011). This effect is mediated by an up-regulation of calmodulinbinding transcription activator 1 (CAMTA1), a tumor suppressor whose 3 UTR is targeted by miR-9. However another study
suggests that miR-9* inhibits the expression of Sox2, a factor
which, in contrast to CAMTA1, confers self-renewal properties
and drug resistance to GSC (Jeon et al., 2011). miR-9 impact on
GSCs and tumor growth seems therefore to be variable among
glioblastoma samples, an observation likely to reflect the high
heterogeneity of these tumors. It would however be particularly
interesting to investigate further the link between miR-9 and GSCs
properties and compare miR-9 action in normal versus tumoral
stem cells.
Surprisingly, miR-9 was also linked with cancers originating
outside the nervous system. In some cases, miR-9 behaves like
an oncogene, in some others like a tumor suppressor. miR-9 is
highly expressed and appears to favor progression of Hodgkin
lymphomas (Leucci et al., 2012), breast cancers (Ma et al., 2010),
cervical cancers (Wilting et al., 2013), colon cancers (Lu et al.,

www.frontiersin.org

November 2013 | Volume 7 | Article 220 | 7

Coolen et al.

miR-9 and neurogenesis

2012) and stomach cancers (Rotkrua et al., 2011). The proximal
causes of miR-9 up-regulation have been identified only in a
few cases. Chromosomal amplifications can account for increased
miR-9 expression in some cervical cancers (Wilting et al., 2013),
while the up-regulation of miR-9-3 transcription is caused by the
MYC oncogene in some breast cancers (Ma et al., 2010). miR-9
has been shown to influence various tumorigenic processes,
including cellular proliferation (Rotkrua et al., 2011; Wilting et al.,
2013), migration (Ma et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2012) and inflammation (Leucci et al., 2012). A reduction of miR-9 expression
compared to normal tissue was also observed in other types of
cancer, including leukemia (Senyuk et al., 2013), lung cancers
(Heller et al., 2012) and colon cancers (Bandres et al., 2009). The
implication of miR-9 in tumorigenesis in such a variety of tissues
suggests that miR-9 may regulate general processes and define a
specific cellular state that could exist outside the nervous system.
miR-9 IN NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS

Links between neurodegenerative disorders and microRNAs,
especially brain enriched microRNAs such as miR-9, have started
to emerge in the literature (Lau and de Strooper, 2010). Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative
disease caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions in the Huntingtin gene (Htt). One hallmark of HD is an alteration of the
transcriptome of some brain regions, linked to abnormal activity
of the transcriptional repressor REST (Buckley et al., 2010). In
contrast to the wild-type HTT, mutant HTT no longer traps REST
in the cytoplasm, thus allowing it to translocate to the nucleus
and excessively represses its targets. As previously mentioned,
REST was shown to repress miR-9 transcription and REST and
its co-repressor coREST are targets of miR-9/9* (Packer et al.,
2008; Laneve et al., 2010). In the brain of HD patients, miR-9/9*

FIGURE 4 | miR-9 protects the brain from Progerin. Two alternative
transcripts are generated from the the Lamin A/C gene, encoding Lamin C
and Lamin A proteins. HGPS is caused by a mutation in exon 11, which is
specific to Lamin A encoding transcripts. The mutation generates an
additional splice site, which leads to the generation of a new transcript

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

expression decreases with increasing disease grades (Packer et al.,
2008). The down-regulation of miR-9/9* could be linked to the
excessive activity of REST and may also amplify REST activity
by increasing REST and coREST protein levels. Considering the
number of targets of miR-9/9*, their down-regulation could
also impact more widely the transcriptional landscape in HD
patients brains. miR-9 was also found to be deregulated in other
neurodegenerative disorders. It is down-regulated in the brain
of Alzheimer’s disease patients (Cogswell et al., 2008; Hébert
et al., 2008) and up-regulated in the cortex of Parkinson’s disease
patients (Kim et al., 2007). Finally, miR-9 was suggested to participate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative
disease affecting MN (Haramati et al., 2010). miR-9 was shown to
be down-regulated in a mouse model of motoneuron disease and
its over-expression can repress the expression of a neurofilament
heavy subunit previously linked to motoneuron degeneration.
Probing more directly the impact of miR-9 deregulation on neurodegenerative disease progression is a challenging task, which
will need to be addressed in the future.
miR-9 PROTECTS NEURAL TISSUE FROM DELETERIOUS PROGERIN

Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare disease
whose symptoms resemble physiological ageing. It is caused by
a de novo specific mutation in LMNA gene. This gene encodes
two components of the nuclear lamina, lamin A and lamin
C, as a result of alternative splicing (Figure 4). HGPS causing
mutations affect only lamin A-encoding transcripts and generate
a truncated form of this protein which is toxic to cells, referred
to as Progerin. While most tissues and organs are affected by
the presence of Progerin, the CNS of HGPS-affected patients is
remarkably spared. This is most likely due to a lower expression of lamin A in neural cells, but the underlying mechanism

encoding a truncated form of Lamin A. The truncated protein is referred to as
Progerin, and is toxic to cells. The presence of miR-9 in the central nervous
system can explain, at least in part, the low levels of Lamin A detected in this
tissue compared to Lamin C. In HGPS patients, miR-9 repression of Progerin
expression protects the CNS from this harmful protein.

Coolen et al.

miR-9 and neurogenesis

remained unknown. Two recent studies demonstrated a role of
miR-9 in this process (Jung et al., 2012; Nissan et al., 2012). The
first study confirmed that lamin A transcripts and proteins are
less abundant than lamin C in mouse brains, whereas they are
expressed at similar levels in other tissues (Jung et al., 2012).
Low levels of Progerin were also found in the brain of knock-in
mice harboring the HGPS mutant allele. The authors could show
that the differential levels of lamin A versus lamin C in brain
tissues was not linked to differences in alternative splicing, but
rather that it is likely linked to the presence of miR-9 in neural
tissues. Lamin A and C encoding transcripts possess different
3 UTR sequences, but only lamin A transcripts can be downregulated by miR-9 through a functional binding site. Inhibition
of miR-9 in neural cells in vitro lead to increased levels of lamin A
transcripts. These results were confirmed to be relevant in human
patients by the second study, in which neural cells differentiated
from HGPS patient-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) were
analyzed (Nissan et al., 2012). Neural stem cells and neurons
derived from patient iPSCs express lower levels of lamin A and
Progerin transcripts compared to other iPSC derived cell types.
These cells are also characterized by high levels of miR-9. Overexpression of miR-9 in mesenchymal cells of HGPS patients could
reduce the levels of lamin A and progerin, an effect mediated by
the 3 UTR of the lamin A transcripts. Altogether this suggests that
miR-9 expression may account for the low expression of lamin A
in the neural tissue, thus protecting it from the deleterious effects
of Progerin in HGPS patients. This regulation could stimulate the
development of new therapies for HGPS patients. The reason why
lamin A expression would need to be restricted by miR-9 in a
healthy brain remains to be discovered.

CONCLUSION
miR-9 is a very ancient microRNA and its function and set of
targets seem to have undergone dramatic changes during the
evolution of Bilateria. In drosophila, through its expression in
non-neural cells miR-9a confers robustness to the developmental
program of peripheral organs. In contrast, in vertebrates, miR-9
displays a conserved expression pattern in the CNS. During
vertebrate evolution, miR-9 seemingly had the time to accumulate
a large set of mRNA targets, and is deeply embedded in the
gene network controlling the behavior of neural progenitors.
Strikingly, functional studies of miR-9 point to a highly versatile
action. Conditional depletion of miR-9 in vivo, using refined
genetic tools, will help better characterizing this phenomenon
in vivo. In addition, to better understand the full repertoire of
miR-9 actions, it will be necessary to identify the set of miR-9
targets in different cellular contexts and evaluate the functional
impact of these interactions individually. This will constitute a
major challenge, especially since miR-9 targets are functionally
interconnected. For most targets studied so far in vertebrates,
miR-9 binding sites are highly conserved and are thus part of
an ancestral set of miR-9 targets. It would be interesting now
to start to explore species-specific targets of miR-9 and see how
they could participate in the diversification of the nervous system.
Finally, to investigate the variability of miR-9 actions, it will be of
interest to identify its regulators. In vertebrates, the transcription
factors that were shown to bind miR-9 promoters are all repressors

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

(Tlx, REST, Hes1); the factors that can induce miR-9 expression
are still unknown. Further studying the link between miR-9
activity and RNA binding proteins, which can either regulate
miR-9 expression and processing or alter its effect of mRNA
targets, will refine our understanding of miR-9 action (Shibata
et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013). Altogether, a comprehensive knowledge of how miR-9 function can be modulated
across different species and cellular contexts will be necessary to
unravel its contribution in human pathologies.
