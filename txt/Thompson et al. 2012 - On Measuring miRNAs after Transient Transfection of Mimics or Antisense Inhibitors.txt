Abstract
The ability to alter microRNA (miRNA) abundance is crucial for studying miRNA function. To achieve this there is widespread
use of both exogenous double-stranded miRNA mimics for transient over-expression, and single stranded antisense RNAs
(antimiRs) for miRNA inhibition. The success of these manipulations is often assessed using qPCR, but this does not
accurately report the level of functional miRNA. Here, we draw attention to this discrepancy, which is overlooked in many
published reports. We measured the functionality of exogenous miRNA by comparing the total level of transfected miRNA
in whole cell extracts to the level of miRNA bound to Argonaute following transfection and show that the
supraphysiological levels of transfected miRNA frequently seen using qPCR do not represent the functional levels, because
the majority of transfected RNA that is detected is vesicular and not accessible for loading into Argonaute as functionally
active miRNAs. In the case of microRNA inhibition by transient transfection with antisense inhibitors, there is also the
potential for discrepancy, because following cell lysis the abundant inhibitor levels from cellular vesicles can directly
interfere with the PCR reaction used to measure miRNA level.

by deep sequencing. Measurement of the transfected miRNA by
qPCR indicated miR-200a was increased by .1000- fold, to a
level vastly greater than the most abundant endogenous miRNAs,
such as miR-125b and miR-16 (Fig. 1). However, we found that
double-stranded miRNA mimics added to cell extracts post-lysis
were also detected at high level by the qPCR (Fig. 1), demonstrating that qPCR amplification alone does not necessarily
indicate functionality.
To measure the level of functional miRNA in a manner that
avoids detecting miRNA mimic trapped in non-functional
locations, we immunoprecipitated UV cross-linked RISC from
control and transfected cells and measured the amount of RISCassociated miR-200a by deep sequencing of the miRNA-sized
RNA fraction in the immunoprecipitate. This revealed that the
amount of RISC-associated miR-200a in the transfected cells was
approximately equal to the level of other abundant miRNAs
(Fig. 2A). This is proportionally much less than the level of miR200a measured by qPCR (Fig. 1, Fig. 2B), indicating most of the
transfected miRNA mimic is not bound to Argonaute and
consequently is not functional. Similar results were obtained
following transfection of a different miRNA, miR-200b (data not
shown). Thus, although qPCR is a valid technique to measure
total miRNA amount, this can be very different from the amount
of functional miRNA.
Given the majority of miRNA mimic detected by qPCR did not
represent the active Argonaute-bound population, we determined
its sub-cellular localisation by transfecting a fluorescent siRNA and
examining the transfected cells by fluorescence microscopy. The

Introduction
MicroRNAs are small endogenous RNA molecules that guide
the RNA-protein complex, RISC (RNA induced silencing
complex), to target sequences in mRNAs. The biosynthesis and
functions of miRNAs have been reviewed recently [1]. RISCloaded miRNAs bind in a sequence-specific manner to target
mRNAs, initiating their repression through a combination of
translational inhibition, RNA destabilisation (via de-capping and
de-adenylation) or, albeit rarely in mammals, direct RISCmediated mRNA cleavage [2,3,4,5,6,7]. The majority of mRNA
transcripts are subject to direct miRNA-mediated regulation,
largely via interactions with target 39 untranslated regions.
Consequently, miRNAs are directly or indirectly involved in most
biological processes and have been extensively implicated in such
areas as development, immune regulation and cancer progression.

Results and Discussion
For a miRNA to be functional, it must be incorporated into
RISC. While qPCR is a simple and commonly used method to
measure the level of a miRNA, it does not distinguish between
miRNAs in functional or non-functional pools. To assess whether
the majority of transiently transfected miRNA resides in a
functional location, we transfected miR-200a mimic into MDAMB-231 cells, which have very little endogenous miR-200a, and
measured the miR-200a level after 2 days by TaqMan qPCR
assay or by immunoprecipitation with anti-Ago antibody followed

measured by qPCR (Fig. 6A), we found that much of the apparent
decrease in miRNA was attributable to the suppressive effect of
antisense inhibitor on the PCR reaction itself. This was revealed
by the addition of the same amount of antisense inhibitor directly
to the cells after lysis by TRIzol, but prior to RNA extraction,
which appeared to give a similar decrease in the level of miR-200a
as measured by qPCR. Coupled with the fact that most of the
transfected oligonucleotide is located in vesicles, this indicates that
the qPCR may be largely measuring the inhibitory effect of the
vesicle-associated antisense inhibitors on the qPCR, rather than its
antisense activities within cells. We note that both 29-O-Methyl
and LNA (locked nucleic acid) miRNA inhibitors are similarly
subject to this phenomenon (Fig. 6A, B). This complements
previous observations that the LNA:miRNA complex interferes
with the binding of the Northern blot probe when measuring
miRNA inhibition by Northern blot [11].
Whilst miRNA mimics and antisense inhibitors are valuable
tools, our observations indicate caveats to the analysis of miRNA
and antisense inhibitor transfection that are apparently not
universally appreciated, leading to the surprisingly frequent use
in the literature (examples available on request) of qPCR for
mRNA measurement when a readout of function would be more
appropriate. Better options are the use of a miRNA reporter (such
as luciferase or a fluorescent protein under the control of miRNA
target sites) to report the relative functional level of a miRNA, or
measurement of the miRNA level following Argonaute immunoprecipitation.

transfection with miRNA mimic. miR-200a, miR-125b and miR-16
levels were quantitated by qPCR following either transfection of the
miR-200a mimic in MDA-MB-231 cells, following addition of the miRNA
mimic post lysis (doping), or after both transfection and doping.

majority of the siRNA did not co-localise with Argonaute (Fig. 3A;
Fig. 3B), which is consistent with earlier reports of transfected
siRNA localising in large cytoplasmic aggregates that are distinct
from the GW bodies that are known for their role in RNA
silencing [8]. Instead the vast majority of miRNA transfected with
either HiPerfect, (Fig. 4a), RNAi-Max (Fig. 4b) or Lipofectamine
2000 (data not shown) localised with or adjacent to lysosomes,
matching earlier reports of lipid-based siRNA transfection [9,10].
Therefore, the high level of transfected miRNA detected by qPCR
is largely attributable to their retention within vesicles and
subsequent amplification by qPCR following lysis. Hence, the
use of qPCR to measure a miRNA after transient transfection can
give the false impression that the miRNA is at massively nonphysiological level, whereas the amount of miRNA bound to
Argonaute may indeed be appropriately physiological. On the
other hand, it is conceivable that an inefficient transfection that
results in just a small proportion of cells being transfected could
appear to produce an adequate level of miRNA, if measured by
qPCR. It is more appropriate to use an assay of miRNA function
to verify the effectiveness of the transfection.
Of additional interest to users of miRNA mimics for transient
transfection, we were able to confirm from our sequencing of the
Argonaute-bound pool of small RNAs, that while a miRNA mimic
with unmodified passenger strand results in abundant incorporation of the passenger strand into RISC (Fig. 5A), raising the
potential for extensive off-target effects, a mimic that is modified to
limit the incorporation of the passenger strand into RISC does
indeed achieve this (Fig. 5B). Although the merits of modified
mimics have been previously recognised, published evidence for
this is limited to date and has been based largely on reporter assays
comparing the response of reporters that harbour a target site for
either the siRNA sense strand or passenger strand (http://
products.invitrogen.com/ivgn/product/AM17100). Our observation provides additional support for the lack of incorporation of
modified passenger strand.
qPCR is also sometimes used to verify the inhibition of a
miRNA by transiently transfected antisense inhibitor, but this can
also be problematic because the antisense inhibitor can directly
inhibit the qPCR reaction. For example, in an experiment where
transfection of miR-200a antisense inhibitor into MCF7 cells
produced an apparent ,50% decrease in miR-200a levels as

Materials and Methods
Quantitative PCR following miRNA mimic transfection or
addition post lysis
60 nM miR-200a mimic (Ambion or Genepharma) was
transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells using Lipofectamine 2000
transfection reagent (Invitrogen) or Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(Invitrogen) compared to a scrambled control miRNA. Cells were
incubated at 37uC, 5% CO2 for 48 h and harvested with TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen). Prior to RNA extraction samples were doped
(addition without transfection) with the equivalent amounts of
miR-200a mimic. qRT-PCR was performed using MultiScribe
RT and TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems) for hsa-miR-200a,
hsa-miR-16 and hsa-miR-125b. Unmodified miRNA mimics were
obtained from GenePharma and proprietary modified miRNAs
(designed for selective incorporation of the guide strand into
RISC) are from Ambion.

Argonaute: miRNA immunoprecipitation
MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in 20610 cm dishes and
transfected with 60 nM miRNA mimic (Ambion/GenePharma)
using HiPerfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). 24 h later, cells
were suspended in ice-cold PBS by scraping and subjected to UV
crosslinking at 254 nM (Stratalinker). Cell pellets were lysed (0.1%
SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% NP-40 with protease inhibitors,
Roche) for 10 mins on ice followed by RQ1 DNAse (Promega) at
37uC for 15 mins with shaking. RNAse A/T1 (Ambion) was then
added for a further 8 mins, prior to the addition of EDTA
(30 mM). Pellets were then spun (30,000 rpm) and the lysate
subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2 h with a pan-anti-Ago
antibody (2A8, kind gift of Zissimos Mourelatos) conjugated to
protein-A dynabeads (Invitrogen) using bridging rabbit anti-mouse
IgG (Jackson Immunolabs). Pellets were then successively washed
(0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% NP40 in 16 PBS; 0.1%
SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% NP40 in 56 PBS; 50 mM Tris
pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP40) and on-bead phosphatase

exposed to film at 280uC for 3 days. Complexes running at
,110 kDa were then excised with a scalpel and resuspended
(100 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 4 mg/ml
proteinase K) for 20 mins at 37uC. The sample was incubated for
an additional 20 minutes in the presence of 3.5 M urea and RNA
isolated by a phenol-chloroform extraction. Sample was then run
on a 10% denaturing (1:19) polyacrylamide gel and exposed to
