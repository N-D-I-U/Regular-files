Parkinson’s disease

| target validation | neuroprotection

P

arkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative
disease characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic
(DAergic) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), leading to
striatal dopamine (DA) deficiency (1). Current medications replenish DA and offer temporary symptomatic relief to patients;
however, chronic treatments cause serious side effects in almost
all patients, including abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs)
and dyskinesias, limiting their efficacy (2). Moreover, DA replacement does not impede neurodegeneration, and PD pathology
progresses (3). Despite considerable advances in our understanding
of PD pathophysiology, pharmacologic strategies to prevent neurodegeneration remain elusive, and the disease remains incurable.
Therefore, validation of novel targets that diminish DA replacement side effects and halt or slow disease progression is an
urgent unmet clinical need (4).
Nurr1 (NR4A2), a nuclear receptor, is a promising candidate,
implicated in both DA biosynthesis and DAergic neuron survival.
Nurr1 is expressed in developing and mature DAergic neurons and
is required for both survival and final complete DAergic differentiation (5, 6). Nurr1 enhances in vitro and in vivo transcription of
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme of DA biosynthesis, and of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH1), the first enzyme in
the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor
for TH activity (7, 8). Decreased Nurr1 levels have been strongly
associated with PD and reduced DAergic neuron survival.
Nurr1 ablation in adult mice leads to dystrophic DAergic axons (9),
loss of striatal DA (10), and behavioral features of parkinsonism

during aging (11). Nurr1 mutations decreasing its mRNA have
been found in patients with familial and sporadic PD (12, 13).
Given the role of Nurr1 in PD, we theorized that pharmacologic
activation of Nurr1 could serve as monotherapy for PD, offering
both disease modification and symptomatic relief.
Nurr1 binds to DNA as a monomer, homodimer, or heterodimer
with retinoid X receptor (RXR)α or RXRγ. Because Nurr1 heterodimerizes with RXRα in midbrain DAergic neurons (14), we
postulated that synthetic ligands that bind to the RXRα-binding
pocket would be the preferred approach. RXRα is a heterodimer
partner of several nuclear receptors, and existing synthetic RXRα
ligands activate several RXRα heterodimers (15). Two such ligands,
XCT0135908 and bexarotene (14, 16), have been shown to activate
Nurr1:RXRα as well as other RXRα heterodimers. Bexarotene, an
approved antineoplastic agent activates RXRα heterodimers with
liver X receptor (LXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
gamma (PPARγ), and Nurr1, has shown promising results in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease and PD (16, 17), but these results have not been replicated (18, 19). In vitro, XCT0135908 (14)
activates Nurr1:RXRα heterodimers and RXRα:RXRα homodimers (17), but its bioavailability is unknown.
Here we show that XCT0135908 does not reach the brain and is
essentially inactive in vivo. Rational compound design and synthetic
chemistry enabled us to design BRF110, a selective Nurr1:RXRα
agonist with combinatorial neuroprotective and symptomatic benefits in preclinical mouse models, validating Nurr1:RXRα heterodimer activation as a promising monotherapy for PD.
Significance
In Parkinson’s disease (PD), dopamine (DA)-producing neurons
gradually degenerate, leading to DA deficiency and to the main
symptoms of PD. Current medications do not impede neurodegeneration, but relieve symptoms by replenishing DA; however, their chronic use causes serious side effects. We targeted a
protein required for the development and function of DA neurons
by designing a chemical compound that, by activating this protein,
increases DA and improves symptoms without current treatment
side effects while simultaneously preventing neuron loss in PD
mice. Our findings point to a monotherapy that can both impede
PD progression and concurrently improve symptoms of PD.

NEUROSCIENCE

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in
the substantia nigra and the gradual depletion of dopamine (DA).
Current treatments replenish the DA deficit and improve symptoms but induce dyskinesias over time, and neuroprotective therapies are nonexistent. Here we report that Nuclear receptor-related 1
(Nurr1):Retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) activation has a double therapeutic potential for PD, offering both neuroprotective and symptomatic improvement. We designed BRF110, a unique in vivo active
Nurr1:RXRα-selective lead molecule, which prevents DAergic neuron
demise and striatal DAergic denervation in vivo against PD-causing
toxins in a Nurr1-dependent manner. BRF110 also protects against
PD-related genetic mutations in patient induced pluripotent stem cell
(iPSC)-derived DAergic neurons and a genetic mouse PD model. Remarkably, besides neuroprotection, BRF110 up-regulates tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), and GTP
cyclohydrolase I (GCH1) transcription; increases striatal DA in vivo;
and has symptomatic efficacy in two postneurodegeneration PD
models, without inducing dyskinesias on chronic daily treatment.
The combined neuroprotective and symptomatic effects of BRF110
identify Nurr1:RXRα activation as a potential monotherapeutic approach for PD.

Results
XCT0135908 in Vivo: Low Stability and Low Brain Penetration.

XCT0135908 was administered to mice to test its bioactivity. Intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injections of XCT0135908
(1 and 10 mg/kg) did not result in any changes in expression
of midbrain genes, such as c-jun or TH, at various time points
after administration. LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry) analysis of blood plasma or brain homogenates and targeted search of the parent compound at 1 and 2 h
after i.p. administration of XCT0135908 (1 μg/kg) indicated low
compound stability and minimal brain penetration (brain/blood
<0.03) (Fig. S1).
Discovery of the Nurr1:RXRα Activator BRF110. Because specific
Nurr1:RXRα activators do not exist (20), we confronted the
challenge to discover compounds that would be specific for
Nurr1:RXRα heterodimers, stable in vivo, and brain-penetrant.
Based on existing chemical structures and their function on
RXRα in a variety of assays, we synthesized several series of
compounds (termed BRFs). Human DAergic neuroblastoma
SHSY-5Y cells cotransfected with a DR5-luciferase reporter
construct, along with human Nurr1 and RXRα expression plasmids (Fig. 1 A and B), were treated with each of the experimental compounds at varying concentrations. Compounds active
in vitro were routinely administered i.p. in mice (at 1 μg/kg), and
brain penetration was evaluated by LC-MS/MS. This scheme and
meticulous structure–activity relation analysis resulted in the
identification of BRF110 (Fig. 1C and Figs. S2 and S3), which
activates Nurr1:RXRα heterodimers (EC50 ∼900 nM; Fig. S4).
In silico docking simulations show that BRF110 complements
the hydrophobic L-shaped binding pocket of RXRα [Protein Data
Bank (PDB) ID code 1MV9]. The carboxylic group of BRF110,
with the participation of a water molecule, forms a hydrogen bond
with the backbone amide of A327 and a salt bridge with the side
chain of R316. The phenyl ring of BRF110 participates in π–π
interactions with F346 and stabilizes the molecule in the RXRαbinding pocket, contributing to target affinity (calculated ΔG,
−16.7 kcal/mol) (Fig. 1D and Fig. S5A). These simulations were
validated by methyl or ethyl ester carboxylic group modifications,
which abolished activation, increasing EC50 by 50- to 100-fold
(Fig. S5B). In addition, halogenation of the BRF110 phenyl ring
disturbs the π–π interactions with F346 and also increases the
EC50 by approximately sevenfold (Fig. S5C).

BRF110 of DR5-luciferase reporter plasmid introduced into SHSY-5Y cells infected
with either a control retrovirus or the retrovirus carrying shNurr1 sequences.

ligand-binding domain fusions cotransfected with RXRα:vp16 fusions activated by
BRF110 at the indicated concentrations.

Specificity of BRF110 for Nurr1:RXRα Heterodimers and Brain
Penetration. BRF110 activated Nurr1:RXRα heterodimers (Fig.

1E), but did not activate Nurr1:RXRγ heterodimers (Fig. 1F), indicating that it is specific for RXRα and does not bind to Nurr1. In
naïve SHSY-5Y cells, BRF110 activated endogenous Nurr1:RXRα
heterodimers, as verified by loss of activity after knockdown of
Nurr1 by ∼60% using a retrovirus carrying shNurr1 sequences (Fig.
1G), indicating that Nurr1 is required for BRF110 activity (Fig. 1H).
To test off-target effects of BRF110 besides Nurr1:RXRα heterodimers, we fused the ligand-binding domains of Nurr1, RXRα,
and a variety of related nuclear receptors to the GAL4 DNAbinding domain to create chimeric proteins, and also fused the
ligand-binding domain of RXRα with VP16. These molecular chimeras were cotransfected in pairs with RXRα:VP16 along with
a GAL4-responsive luciferase reporter in SHSY-5Y cells stimulated
with BRF110. BRF110 strongly activated Nurr1GAL4:RXRαVP16
heterodimer chimeras, but failed to activate other RXRαVP16
heterodimer chimeras with vitamin D receptor VDRGAL4,
RXRγGAL4, PPARγGAL4, or RXRαGAL4 homodimer chimeras
(Fig. 1I). Nur77GAL4:RXRαVP16 heterodimers were partially
activated, but Nur77, unlike Nurr1, is not associated with PD, and
Nur77 knockdown enhances cell survival (21). The foregoing experiments indicate the high degree of selectivity of BRF110.
BRF110 (1 mg/kg) administered i.p. in mice reached the brain,
with an approximate half-life of ∼1.5 h in both blood and brain as
assessed by LC-MS/MS (brain/blood concentration area under
the curve ratio, 1.7; Fig. S6) and was bioactive, increasing midbrain

c-jun expression. These experiments indicate that BRF110 has the
necessary properties to test our monotherapeutic PD hypothesis of
Nurr1:RXRα heterodimer activation.
BRF110 Induces Transcription of DA Biosynthesis Genes and Protects
DAergic Cell Lines and Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived
DAergic Neurons Against PD-Associated Damage. Nurr1 regulates

the transcription of DA biosynthesis genes (7, 8); however,
whether this is mediated by Nurr1:RXRα heterodimers is unknown. In SHSY-5Y cells, BRF110 increased the expression
of the three genes required for DA biosynthesis, TH by ∼90%
(n = 6; P = 0.0374, t test), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase
(AADC) by ∼70% (n = 6; P < 0.0001, t test), and GCH1 by
∼42% (n = 6; P < 0.0001, t test) (Fig. 2A), indicating that this upregulation depends on Nurr1:RXRα heterodimer activation.
We examined the neuroprotective capability of Nurr1:RXRα
heterodimer activation in SHSY-5Y cells in which death was induced
by either oxidative stress-related H2O2 or mitochondria complex I
inhibitor 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) (Fig. 2B). BRF110
(12.5 μM) did not promote cell differentiation or cell proliferation,
but significantly increased cell survival against varying concentrations
of the toxic stimuli (P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA) in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 2C). The protection conferred by BRF110
was Nurr1-dependent, because it was abrogated by knockdown of

ANOVA; P < 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis test) (Fig. 2 M–O). During the
14-d BRF110 treatment of these cells, we did not see any effect on
TuJ1(+)/TH(−) neurons or on DAergic neurons with a WT genotype.
The foregoing experiments demonstrate the in vitro potential
of Nurr1:RXRα activation to shield human DAergic neurons
from diverse PD-related neuronal death stimuli, such as toxins
and the LRRK2-G2019S mutation.
Neuroprotection of BRF110 in Vivo in Preclinical Mouse PD Models.

We assessed the neuroprotective effects of Nurr1:RXRα heterodimer
activation in vivo in two established preclinical C57BL/6 mouse PD
models: acute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
and unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection in the SN.
Intraperitoneal injections of BRF110 (10 mg/kg) every 12 h, starting
12 h before toxin administration, were continued for 6 d in the
MPTP model and for 14 d in the 6-OHDA model. To distinguish
phenotypic effects, lasting 4–8 h (see below), from neuroprotection,
BRF110 administration was discontinued 24–36 h before behavioral and histological examination of the mice. In the MPTP model,
mice receiving BRF110 had considerably improved motor coordination (>100%) (n = 5; P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA) compared with vehicle-injected mice, as assessed by the accelerating
rotarod test (Fig. 3A). SN unbiased stereologic neuronal counting
showed that TH(+) midbrain neuron survival per side was increased by 31% (n = 5; P = 0.0003, one-way ANOVA) in BRF110treated mice, to a value not significantly different from that in
control mice (Fig. 3 B and C). In addition, BRF110 protected SN
axonal projections to the striatum, doubling the number of
remaining terminals (n = 5; P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 3
D and E). This neuroprotective effect was BRF110-dependent,

endogenous Nurr1 mRNA (Figs. 1G and 2D). The neuroprotective
effects of BRF110 extend to damage induced by the PD-associated
mutation G2019S in the leucine‐rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene,
the most common genetic defect associated with clinical PD (22).
Rat cortical neurons cotransfected with CMV-GFP (cytomegalovirus promoter-driven GFP) for identification and CMV-LRRK2G2019S cDNAs show increased apoptosis, as assessed by DAPI
staining and compared with control neurons cotransfected with a
WT LRRK2 cDNA. We did not observe neuronal differentiation
effects on BRF110 treatment, although it reduced apoptosis to
control levels, comparable to those of the LRRK2 inhibitor
GSK2578215A (P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 2 E–I).
The translational therapeutic potential of BRF110 was assessed in
human midbrain-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived DAergic neurons, as indicated by positive staining and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the neuronal markers MAP2, TH, FoxA2,
Lmx1, and En1 (Fig. S7). BRF110 doubled the number of surviving
MPP+-intoxicated neurons compared with vehicle (P < 0.0008, twoway ANOVA) (Fig. 2 J–L). The surviving control neurons had fewer
and retreating projections, indicating compromised function (Fig.
2K), whereas the neurons that received BRF110 retained a complex
network of projections and contacts (Fig. 2L).
In addition, we tested BRF110 in iPSC-derived DAergic neurons from a PD patient carrying the LRRK2-G2019S mutation.
These neurons showed contracted neurites with reduced branching, phenomena that can be reversed on correction (LRRK2GC)
of the LRRK2-G2019S mutation (22). Treatment of the LRRK2G2019S DAergic neurons with BRF110 (12.5 μM) for 14 d
(Fig. 2 M–Q) increased neurite length by 83% (P < 0.0007, oneway ANOVA; P < 0.01, Kruskal–Wallis test), neurite number by
38% (P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA; P < 0.001, Kruskal–Wallis

TH(+) and NeuN(+) midbrain neurons compared with the AAVGFP–injected side (Fig. 4 G–I and Fig. S8B). In contrast, in the
BRF110-treated AAV-ASYN–injected animals, unbiased stereology showed that the number of TH(+) midbrain neurons was
increased by ∼47% (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test; P = 0.00214, Mann–
Whitney U test) and NeuN(+) midbrain neurons (P < 0.05, Wilcoxon test; P = 0.00214, Mann–Whitney U test) compared with
AAV-ASYN–injected animals treated with vehicle (Fig. 4G).
Striatal innervation of unilaterally AAV-ASYN–injected brains
resulted in a dramatic depletion of TH(+) axons by almost 85% in
vehicle-treated mice, whereas in BRF110-treated mice, striatal
TH(+) axons were increased by more than fivefold (P < 0.001,
one-way ANOVA; P < 0.0156, Wilcoxon test) (Fig. 4 J L).

because a once-daily injection regimen (20 mg/kg) was ineffective.
BRF110 neuroprotection against MPTP toxicity was equally effective in 129sv WT mice (vehicle 2,500 ± 91 vs. BRF110 3,250 ±
92; n = 4; P = 0.000571, t test; P < 0.001, one-way ANOVA), but
was abolished in Nurr1+/− 129sv mice. The number of TH(+)
neurons was significantly lower in Nurr1+/− 129sv mice compared
with 129sv WT mice (2,710 ± 91, n = 4 vs. 3,250 ± 92, n = 4; P =
0.00298, t test), confirming that the in vivo neuroprotective effects
of BRF110 require Nurr1:RXRα heterodimers (Fig. 3F).
Nurr1:RXRα activation showed even more striking effects in
the 6-OHDA model. Mice receiving BRF110 exhibited a dramatic reduction (by approximately eightfold) in apomorphineinduced contralateral turns (n = 5; P = 0.0159, Mann–Whitney
U test) (Fig. 4A), whereas motor coordination was almost entirely restored to control levels, as evaluated by the rotarod test
(P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA; P = 0.0079, Mann–Whitney
U test) (Fig. 4B). The number of surviving TH(+) neurons in the
SN of BRF110-treated mice was increased by 47% (P < 0.05,
one-way ANOVA; P = 0.0317, Mann–Whitney U test) to the level
of complete restoration, as indicated by unbiased stereological
neuronal counting (Fig. 4 C and D). Total midbrain neuronal
determination by NueN staining showed similar results (Fig. S8A).
Striatal innervation, which was practically obliterated in the
vehicle-treated control mice, also showed a 10-fold higher
preservation of TH(+) DAergic projections (P < 0.0001, one-way
ANOVA; P = 0.0159, Mann–Whitney U test) (Fig. 4 E and F).
Because the predictive validity of toxin-based mouse PD
models for neuroprotection in humans is questionable, we proceeded to test the effect of BRF110 in a mouse model, in which
adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) overexpressing WT α-synuclein
(ASYN) under the chicken β-actin promoter were injected unilaterally, along with contralateral injections of AAV-GFP. Treatment
with BRF110 (10 mg/kg every 12 h for 2 wk) or vehicle was started

BRF110 Chronic Dosing Does Not Induce Dyskinesias. We next compared BRF110 with L-DOPA in terms of causing AIMs. Mice
treated daily with L-DOPA starting at 21 d after unilateral
6-OHDA injection exhibited severe hyperkinetic dyskinesias/AIMs
within 7 d (Fig. 5 J and K). In contrast, similar daily BRF110
(10 mg/kg) administration for at least 2 wk resulted in consistently improved motor coordination (Fig. 5 H and I) without
dyskinesias/AIMs (P = 0.0061, two-way ANOVA; P = 0.0043,
Mann–Whitney U test) (Fig. 5K). These experiments exemplify
the simultaneous symptomatic usefulness of Nurr1:RXRα activation devoid of undesirable complications.

Discussion
Drug discovery efforts for PD traditionally have been aimed either at symptomatic DA replacement treatments and alleviation
of dyskinesias or at neuroprotection (24, 25). Neuroprotective
approaches, although aimed at the core of PD pathology, so far
have not delivered the expected results (26).
We selected Nurr1 as the target for disease-modifying and
symptomatic relief for PD because it is strongly associated with
PD. Nurr1 mutations have been identified in familial and sporadic
cases of the disease (12, 13), and reduced levels of Nurr1 are associated with PD in both patients and animal models. In addition,
Nurr1 is involved in DA biosynthesis (6, 7). We chose to target
Nurr1 through its heterodimerization partner RXRα, limiting the
activation of other Nurr1 molecules. Our data indicate that activation
of Nurr1:RXRα by BRF110 can provide neuroprotection that can
halt PD-associated neuronal loss in both toxin and genetic preclinical
mouse models of PD. In addition, we have demonstrated that the

Nurr1:RXRα activation in the transcriptional regulation of DA
biosynthesis genes, we tested whether BRF110 could increase
DA levels in vivo. A single i.p. injection of BRF110 (10 mg/kg) in
WT mice increased midbrain TH gene expression (n = 4; P =
0.0396, t test) within 4 h (Fig. 5A). Striatal DA and DA metabolite levels were increased as well, and their ratio remained
constant, indicating physiological DA catabolism (Fig. 5B). Aiming
to model PD based on human genetic data, we also tested whether
BRF110 could increase DA levels in ASYN transgenic mice (23).
A single i.p. injection of BRF110 (10 mg/kg) increased striatal
DA levels (n = 4; P = 0.01069, t test) and DA metabolite levels in
the ASYN transgenic mice compared with mice receiving vehicle
(Fig. 5C). The effect of BRF110 was limited to DA biosynthesis,
because noradrenaline levels remained unaffected (Fig. 5D).
We subsequently tested whether the DA increase could
translate to symptomatic relief in postdegeneration PD mouse
models based on MPTP or 6-OHDA (Fig. 5 E and F). A single
dose of BRF110 (10 mg/kg i.p.) at 8 d after acute MPTP injection
or 5–6 wk after unilateral 6-OHDA injection significantly improved temporarily motor coordination in both models (P =
0.01 and 0.0001, respectively, one-way ANOVA) at 4 h after
dosing (Fig. 5 G and H) and induced contralateral turns in the
6-OHDA model (P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 5I), an
effect similar to that of levodopa (L-DOPA). In these models,
symptom improvement from BFF110 disappeared by 8 h after
dosing. These experiments indicate that Nurr1:RXRα activation

can indeed offer symptomatic relief in rodents, further supporting our monotherapy hypothesis.

The foregoing experiments demonstrate the DAergic neuroprotective effects of Nurr1:RXRα activation in both toxin-based
and ASYN genetic preclinical animal models of PD.

effects of BRF110 both in vitro and in vivo depend on Nurr1 expression, validating the therapeutic target. Because of the divergent
toxin and genetic insults that we used in our PD models, our data
indicate that various pathways leading to DAergic neuron demise can
be overcome by BRF110 activation, implying coordinated control of a
complex neuroprotective network by Nurr1:RXRα.
BRF110 also increases DA levels in vivo and offers symptomatic
relief in two postdegeneration PD animal models at the neuroprotective dose. This dual activity indicates that unlike most efforts
aimed at finding new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of
PD, Nurr1:RXRα activation offers a unique combined efficacy distinct from that of other targets. Moreover, as opposed to the
excessive DA stimulation induced by DA replacement therapies,
BRF110 apparently finely regulates DA production in a more
physiological manner via the transcriptional activation of the DA
biosynthesis genes (TH, GCH1, and AADC), without affecting
DA catabolism and without eliciting dyskinesias. This effect has
been corroborated by the use of a lentiviral tricistronic vector
expressing TH, GCH1, and AADC that alleviates PD symptoms
in primates without dyskinesias (27). A current phase 1/2 clinical
trial using a virtually identical lentiviral vector offers similar
symptomatic relief in PD patients (28).
Our experiments show that a single molecule activating a
single target achieves a double therapeutic advantage for PD
in vivo. Because BRF110 neuroprotection extends to PD patient
iPSC-derived DAergic neurons, Nurr1:RXRα activation has the
potential to benefit PD patients. We believe that our findings
strongly support the use of Nurr1:RXRα activation as a monotherapy for PD.

In Vitro Studies in Neuroblastoma Cell Lines. Naive SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma
cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 and 10% FBS and harvested at indicated
time points. Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) for 4–6 h in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen).
Mice. Mice were housed at the Animal Care Facilities of the Academy of
Athens in a pathogen-free room under a controlled 12-h light/12-h dark cycle
and with free access to food and water. Animal breeding and handling were
performed in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive
86/609/EEC guidelines, and all animal procedures were approved by the
Academy of Athens Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (certified
with ISO 9001:2008). PD mouse models for MPTP, 0.6-OHDA, and ASYN AAV
were generated following established protocols. In brief, we used an acute
MPTP regimen of four 20-mg/kg MPTP injections given 2 h apart. 6-OHDAHCl in saline containing 0.02% ascorbic acid was injected intracerebrally and
unilaterally at the level of the median forebrain bundle (MFB) in anesthetized mice. Recombinant AAVs (AAV-ASYN and AAV-GFP) were injected
stereotactically into the right and left SN, respectively. Experimenters were
blinded to the animal groups for all animal experiments and analyses.
Statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 4. Significance was assessed with one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post
hoc test and by the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test or Kruskal–Wallis
test unless indicated otherwise. A P value <0.05 was considered significant.
In the figures, error bars represent ± SEM, and *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and
***P < 0.001.

The materials and methods used in these experiments are described in detail
in SI Materials and Methods.
