Viral Vector-Based Models of Parkinson’s
Disease
Anke Van der Perren, Chris Van den Haute and Veerle Baekelandt

Abstract In order to study the molecular pathways of Parkinson’s disease (PD)
and to develop novel therapeutic strategies, scientific investigators rely on animal
models. The identification of PD-associated genes has led to the development of
genetic PD models as an alternative to toxin-based models. Viral vector-mediated
loco-regional gene delivery provides an attractive way to express transgenes in the
central nervous system. Several vector systems based on various viruses have
been developed. In this chapter, we give an overview of the different viral
vector systems used for targeting the CNS. Further, we describe the different viral
vector-based PD models currently available based on overexpression strategies for
autosomal dominant genes such as a-synuclein and LRRK2, and knockout or
knockdown strategies for autosomal recessive genes, such as parkin, DJ-1, and
PINK1. Models based on overexpression of a-synuclein are the most prevalent and
extensively studied, and therefore the main focus of this chapter. Many efforts
have been made to increase the expression levels of a-synuclein in the dopaminergic neurons. The best a-synuclein models currently available have been
developed from a combined approach using newer AAV serotypes and optimized
vector constructs, production, and purification methods. These third-generation
a-synuclein models show improved face and predictive validity, and therefore
offer the possibility to reliably test novel therapeutics.

1 Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common age-related movement disorder. It is estimated that PD affects 1 % of the population at 65 years of age,
which increases to 4–5 % in 85-year olds. To date, more than 4.5 million people
suffer from PD worldwide, and this number is expected to double to 9 million in
the next 20 years due to the improved living conditions and the increased life
expectancy (Wirdefeldt et al. 2011). PD is a slowly progressing disorder that
affects the dopaminergic neurons (DN) of the substantia nigra pars compacta
(SNpc), a small nucleus in the midbrain. The loss of dopaminergic innervation
leads to hyperactivity of the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus, resulting
in the progressive decline of movement control, which closely correlates with the
degree of SNpc cell loss (Ma et al. 1997). At the onset of the motor symptoms, the
striatal dopamine (DA) levels are already depleted by 80 % and approximately
50–70 % of the DN in the SNpc has been lost (Dauer and Przedborski 2003).
However, the traditional view that the neuropathology of PD is restricted to nigral
degeneration has been abandoned. For instance, Braak and colleagues define a sixstage pathological process where PD pathology starts in the olfactory bulb and the
dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve and extends to the midbrain and other
brainstem regions in the later stages of the disease process (Braak et al. 2003;
Hawkes et al. 2010). Next to the selective loss of the DN in the SN, PD is
characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) in
the surviving neurons. These cytoplasmic aggregates are predominantly composed
of fibrillar forms of the protein a-synuclein, and can be found in several affected
brain regions of most PD patients (Spillantini et al. 1997; Shults 2006). Currently,
most treatments of PD are focused on the symptomatic improvement of motor
symptoms related to the loss of the DN in the SNpc. These symptomatic treatments
(pharmacological and surgical) significantly reduce PD-associated motor symptoms and improve quality of life and life expectancy. Still, the development
of therapeutic approaches that slow or halt the disease progression, as well as the
identification of reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis remains crucial.

Viral Vector-Based Models of Parkinson’s Disease

Historically, PD has been considered a purely sporadic disorder without a clear
etiology. Environmental factors (e.g., pesticides exposure, living in a rural area,
and well water consumption) have been proposed as important risk factors or
triggers for PD in the context of an aging brain. However, in the past decade,
genetic studies of PD families from different geographical regions worldwide have
strengthened the hypothesis that PD has a substantial genetic compound. The first
gene linked to PD (SNCA, encoding for a-synuclein) was discovered through
analysis of a large multigenerational Greek/Italian family, in which PD segregated
in an autosomal dominant pattern (Polymeropoulos et al. 1997). Since then, 18 PD
loci have been nominated through linkage analysis (PARK 1–15) or genome-wide
association studies (PARK 16–18) (Farrer 2006; Belin and Westerlund 2008;
Satake et al. 2009; Simon-Sanchez et al. 2009; Pankratz et al. 2009; Hamza et al.
2010). Mutations within the genes of six of these loci (SNCA, LRRK2, PRKN,
PINK1, DJ-1, and ATP13A2) have conclusively been demonstrated to cause
familial PD (Lesage and Brice 2009). In addition, common polymorphisms within
two of the same genes (SNCA and LRRK2) are well validated risk factors for PD
(Paisan-Ruiz 2009; Edwards et al. 2010). Although these familial forms of PD
account for only 5–10 % of all PD patients, unraveling of the molecular pathways
underlying familial forms of PD will greatly contribute to our understanding of
sporadic PD since both forms share clinical and neuropathological features.
To study the molecular pathways of PD and to develop novel therapeutic
strategies, investigators rely on animal models. However, to reliably translate the
results from animal experiments to the human disease, one has to consider ‘‘the
validity’’ of the animal model being used. In general, three criteria are taken into
consideration: The face, predictive, and construct validity. The ‘‘face validity’’
refers to a similar pathophysiology; do the symptoms and pathology observed in
the animal model resemble the ones seen in human patients? Face validity can
sometimes be distracting because behavioral manifestations in rodents and people
might differ. The ‘‘predictive validity’’ suggests that a treatment that is effective in
the model will also be successful in patients. A model based on an established
cause of the disease has ‘‘construct validity’’ and is useful in the understanding of
the pathophysiological mechanism. A perfect animal model for PD should display
age-dependent and progressive degeneration of DN, the cardinal motor symptoms
of PD as well as nonmotor dysfunctions and LB pathology in surviving nigral cells
and eventually other brain regions (high face validity). Furthermore, it should be
responsive to dopamine replacement strategies (high predictive validity) and
would be based on a known cause of the disease, e.g., genetic mutation causing
familial PD (high construct validity). Although such a perfect PD model does not
exist, significant progress has been made over the last 15 years. Currently, PD
models are based on toxicological, transgenic, or viral vector-based stereotactic
gene delivery approaches.

2 Toxin-Based Animal Models
Toxin models are the classical and the oldest experimental PD models. They aim at
reproducing the pathological and behavioral changes of the human disease in
rodents or primates by using neurotoxins (e.g., 6-OHDA, MPTP), which selectively accumulate in the substantia nigra DN, causing cellular dysfunction and cell
death (Ungerstedt and Arbuthnott 1970; Betarbet et al. 2002). These toxins can be
administered either locally or systemically depending on the type of toxin used and
the species involved (Bezard and Przedborski 2011). The unilateral 6-OHDA rat
model has been used extensively as a preclinical model to assess the antiparkinsonian effects of new pharmacological treatments (Jiang et al. 1993; Ilijic et al.
2011; Bjorklund et al. 2002; Kirik et al. 2002). Studies using MPTP have led to
concepts such as ‘‘environmental toxicity’’ as a potential cause of dysfunction in
sporadic PD and ‘‘mitochondrial dysfunction’’ as a potential pathogenic mechanism (Fox and Brotchie 2010). However, a major limitation of these toxin models
is that they induce rather acute effects, which differ significantly from the slowly
progressive pathology of human PD. Moreover, LB pathology is not present in the
surviving neurons, and no other brain areas involved in PD are affected. Later, a
variety of other toxic compounds (pesticides) like rotenone, paraquat, and maneb
were tested in vivo in an attempt to find additional and improved toxin models
(Hoglinger et al. 2006; Thiruchelvam et al. 2000). Interestingly, ubiquitinepositive LB-like inclusions were observed in the surviving nigral neurons of
rotenone-treated animals (Betarbet et al. 2000). Despite these positive features, the
substantial variability observed in all of these pesticide models limits their use for
therapeutical development.

3 Transgenic Mouse Models
The discovery of a-synuclein as the first PARK gene in 1997 led to the development of the first genetic PD models. The A53T mutation in a-synuclein was
identified first in a Greek/Italian family (Polymeropoulos et al. 1997). Later, the
A30P mutation and later the E46K mutation were identified in a German and
Spanish family (Kruger et al. 1998; Zarranz et al. 2004). Shortly after these
findings, it was realized that an aggregated form of a-synuclein forms the main
constituent of LBs in both sporadic and familial PD cases (Spillantini et al. 1997).
In addition, duplications and triplications of the entire gene locus have been
reported in different families (Chartier-Harlin et al. 2004; Ibanez et al. 2004;
Singleton et al. 2003). Interestingly, gene triplication leads to earlier onset and
faster progression of disease than duplication, indicating that disease severity is
dependent on a-synuclein expression levels. Altogether, these findings provide
strong evidence that a-synuclein plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PD.
For these reasons, it was hypothesized that overexpression of a-synuclein in the

Viral Vector-Based Models of Parkinson’s Disease

brain may lead to pathological features reminiscent of PD such as neuronal cell
death and the accumulation of cellular inclusions. Many transgenic mice overexpressing human wild-type (WT) or mutant (A30P, A53T) a-synuclein have been
generated over the last 10 years. The promoter driving a-synuclein expression has
proven to be crucial in the development of the pathology. Other significant variations are the mouse strain, the presence or absence of endogenous a-synuclein,
and whether the full length or the truncated form is expressed (detailed review by
Magen and Chesselet 2010). Overexpression of both WT and several clinical
mutants of human a-synuclein in transgenic mice have been shown to induce
pathological accumulation of a-synuclein and neuronal dysfunction (Masliah et al.
2000; Freichel et al. 2007; Fleming et al. 2005; Kahle et al. 2001; Chesselet and
Richter 2011). However, until now most transgenic a-synuclein mouse models
failed to display clear dopaminergic cell loss and dopamine-dependent behavioral
deficits. Some transgenic models expressing the double mutated (Thiruchelvam
et al. 2004; Richfield et al. 2002; Chen et al. 2006) or truncated (Tofaris et al.
2006; Shelkovnikova et al. 2011; Wakamatsu et al. 2008) a-synuclein gene have
reported dopaminergic cell loss, but the clinical relevance of these models is
questionable.
Later, the identification of other PD-associated genes has led to the development of more genetic PD models. Overexpression strategies for autosomal dominant genes such as LRRK2 and knockout strategies for autosomal recessive genes
such as Parkin, DJ-1, and PINK1 were used. Current transgenic LRRK2 mouse
models are not very robust PD models. BAC transgenic mice expressing R1441G,
G2019S LRRK2 present minimal evidence of neurodegeneration (Li et al. 2009,
2010). When the R1441C mutation is expressed under the control of endogenous
regulatory elements, by knock-in of the R1441C mutation, no degeneration of DN
is observed (Tong et al. 2009). For one R1441G-LRRK2 transgenic mouse
abnormalities in the nigrostriatal system such as stimulated DA neurotransmission
and L-dopa responsive behavioral defects have been described, but no DN loss was
reported (Li et al. 2009). Recently, mice expressing the G2019S mutant showed
loss of DN and dendrites at 19–20 months of age (Ramonet et al. 2011).
None of the parkin KO mice have substantial dopaminergic or behavioral
abnormalities (Itier et al. 2003; Perez and Palmiter 2005; Von Coelln et al. 2004;
Goldberg et al. 2003; Zhu et al. 2007). Some have subtle abnormalities in their DA
neurotransmission or in the noradrenergic system of the locus coeruleus (Goldberg
et al. 2003). Interestingly, overexpression of truncated human parkin (Q311X) led
to progressive degeneration of DN (Lu et al. 2009), supporting the idea that some
parkin mutants might act in a dominant negative fashion. Similar to the parkin KO
mice, PINK-1 KO mice do not show any loss of DN, have normal levels of striatal
DA and DA receptors are unchanged in most KO mice (Gautier et al. 2008; Kitada
et al. 2007). Mild abnormalities in DA neurotransmission have been described
(Kitada et al. 2007). DJ-1 KO mice do not exhibit any major abnormalities, and the
number of DN and levels of striatal DA are unchanged. Abnormalities in DA
neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal circuit and mitochondrial dysfunction were
observed in some DJ-1 KO animals (Goldberg et al. 2005; Kim et al. 2005;

A. Van der Perren et al.

Andres-Mateos et al. 2007). To summarize, all parkin, PINK1, and DJ-1 KO
animals present only a mild phenotype without clear neurodegeneration.
In conclusion, in some transgenic models based on mutations causing PD, loss
of DN has been reported, specifically in mice expressing the double mutated
(Thiruchelvam et al. 2004; Richfield et al. 2002; Chen et al. 2006) or truncated
(Tofaris et al. 2006; Shelkovnikova et al. 2011; Wakamatsu et al. 2008) a-synuclein
gene, a truncated form of parkin (Lu et al. 2009), or the G2019S mutation in LRRK2
(Ramonet et al. 2011). Nevertheless, most transgenic a-synuclein mouse models
develop gradual a-synuclein pathology, but fail to display clear dopaminergic cell
loss and dopamine-dependent behavioral deficits. This hurdle was overcome by
direct targeting of the SN with viral vectors overexpressing PD-associated genes.

4 Viral Vector-Based PD Models
Viral vector-mediated loco-regional gene delivery provides an alternative way to
express transgenes in the CNS with several advantages: Local transgene delivery
allows for specific targeting of brain regions; transgene expression can be induced
during adulthood, bypassing the risk of compensatory mechanisms during development; different doses can be applied; models can be created in multiple species
and strains, ranging from rodents to nonhuman primates and finally different
combinations of genes can easily be made. Since the first proof of principle of this
technique, a continuously growing number of publications have proven the value
of viral vector-mediated loco-regional transduction. Before we discuss the different viral vector-based PD models currently available, we will give an overview
of the different viral vector systems used for delivery of transgenes to the brain.

4.1 Viral Vectors for Gene Transfer
Viruses are efficient vehicles to infect cells to introduce genetic material and force
the cell to replicate the viral genome in order to produce new virus particles. Viruses
can be engineered to nonreplicating viral vectors that retain their ability of entering
cells and introducing genes. By deleting parts of the viral genome and replacing
them by the genes of interest, application of the vector will result in a single-round
infection without replication in the host cell. The general design of viral vectors is
based on the physical separation in different plasmids of the cis-elements involved
in the transfer of the vector genome from trans-acting elements encoding for the
viral (structural) proteins. These plasmids deliver the necessary components to
assemble a vector particle during the vector production in producer cells. Viral
vectors can be used for both overexpression and silencing of certain genes.
The transgene encoded by the vector can be a reporter protein for visualization of the

Viral Vector-Based Models of Parkinson’s Disease

labeled cells by immunohistochemical or non-invasive imaging techniques such as
bioluminescence, nuclear medicine techniques, or magnetic resonance imaging
(Deroose et al. 2009). The expressed protein can be a therapeutic protein for gene
therapy applications (Manfredsson et al. 2007; Vercammen et al. 2006; Winklhofer
2007) or as we will focus on in this chapter, a disease-related protein used for disease
modeling (Kirik et al. 2002, 2003; Lauwers et al. 2003; Klein et al. 2002). Several
vector systems based on various viruses have been developed. The choice of the
vector system depends on the size of the gene of interest, the required duration of
gene expression, the target cells and biosafety issues (see Table 1). For stable gene
transfer in the brain, LV and rAAV vectors are the vector systems of choice since
they lead to efficient and long-term gene expression in the rodent brain. The different
vector systems will be described in more detail in the following section.

4.1.1 Lentiviral Vectors
LVs are derived from lentiviruses, a family of complex retroviruses that have the
ability to replicate in non-dividing cells as opposed to simple retroviruses. Vectors
derived from these viruses are an attractive means for gene transfer to the central
nervous system (CNS) because they are capable of efficiently transducing nondividing mature neurons. The prototypical lentivirus is the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which has a diameter of 110 nm and contains two
copies of a 9200 bp ss RNA genome. The genome has three major coding regions
in common with simple retroviruses (gag, pol, and env), flanked by two long
terminal repeats (LTR). Gag encodes the structural core protein matrix, capsid,
and nucleocapsid, pol encodes the viral enzymes [protease, reverse transcriptase
(RT), and integrase] and env encodes the glycoprotein components of the viral
envelope. In addition, complex retroviruses have six accessory genes (tat, rev, vpr,
vpu, vif, and nef) that encode for additional regulatory proteins. These accessory
genes are not essential for viral replication in cell culture, but determine the
pathogenicity of viral infection in vivo. Several studies have shown that LVs
derived from HIV-1 are indeed capable of efficient and stable expression of the
transgene in vivo without induction of significant immune response (Baekelandt
et al. 2002; Naldini et al. 1996a, b; Zufferey et al. 1997).
Design of Lentiviral Vectors
The first generation of LVs derived from HIV-1 was developed in 1996, by Naldini
et al. (1996a, b). LVs are usually produced by triple transfection of HEK293T cells
with three different plasmids, providing the cis- and trans-elements necessary for
the production of vector particles (Fig. 1). The first plasmid, the packaging plasmid
encodes structural viral proteins from gag and enzymes from pol under the control
of a constitutive promoter. For biosafety reasons, the packaging signal (W) and the
env gene have been deleted. The envelope plasmid mostly codes for the envelope
glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). This VSV-G envelope

Viral Vector-Based Models of Parkinson’s Disease

results in a broad cellular tropism and efficiently targets neurons and astrocytes in
the CNS and ensures a better stability of the vector particle compared to HIV
enveloped vectors. The third plasmid, the transfer plasmid encodes the transgene of
interest under the control of a heterologous promoter. It contains cis-acting
sequences necessary for encapsidation, reverse transcription, and integration
flanked by two LTRs. LTRs are necessary for integration of the proviral DNA
mediated by the viral integrase and also contain a promoter for proviral DNA
transcription. After triple transfection, the vector particles produced by the
HEK293T cells are released into the medium and can be purified and concentrated.
After the initial validation of the LV system, additional elements were introduced to increase the specificity and enhance the efficiency of these vectors. A first
improvement was the insertion of the central polypurine tract (cPPT), which is
thought to facilitate reverse transcription and nuclear import of the lentiviral preintegration complex prior to vector integration. Inclusion of this element in the LV
increased the transduction efficiency and gene expression 3- to 10-fold (De Rijck
et al. 2005; Zennou et al. 2000). A second improvement was the introduction of the
Woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) that
enhanced expression levels about 5- to 8-fold in a number of different cell lines
and tissues due to an increased mRNA stability in the cytoplasm (Zufferey et al.
1999). LV containing both the cPPT and the WPRE has higher in vivo transduction efficiency than the sum of the expression levels reached by LV containing
only the cPPT or the WPRE (Baekelandt et al. 2002).
Biosafety of Lentiviral Vectors
Lentiviral vectors derived from HIV-1 may provoke biosafety concerns because of
the well-known pathogenicity of the parental virus. An important issue is the
potential occurrence of replication competent retroviruses (RCR), which can
theoretically be generated during vector production by homologous recombination.
A lot of effort has been undertaken to improve the biosafety of lentiviral vectors. In
addition to the removal of accessory genes in the transfer plasmid, thereby
reducing or eliminating the pathogenicity of HIV-1, safer LVs have been developed by splitting the cis- and trans-acting viral sequences over separate expression
plasmids and deleting promoter and enhancer elements in the transfer vector itself.
This reduces the probability of homologous recombination.
In the first generation of vectors, the env gene coding for the natural HIV
envelope was replaced by the VSG-G gene. As a result, no WT HIV-1 could ever
arise even if the three plasmids recombined. The encapsidation signal was removed
from the packaging plasmid and the viral LTRs were replaced by a heterologous
promoter at the 50 -end and a polyadenylation signal at the 30 -end. In the secondgeneration vectors, the virulence genes vpr, vpu, vif, and nef were deleted from the
packaging construct without loss of transduction capacity (Zufferey et al. 1997).
Since it is known that WT HIV-1 loses its pathogenicity when devoid of these
proteins, deletion of these genes further increased biosafety. Vectors from the third
generation do not require tat anymore since the U3 region of the 50 -LTR, which

A. Van der Perren et al.

enhances viral transcription in the presence of tat was replaced by a constitutive
promoter (Dull et al. 1998). This allowed tat gene deletion from the packaging
plasmids. In addition, rev, an accessory protein mediating nuclear export of viral
RNA was supplied from a fourth plasmid, further reducing the chance of
recombination.
Another strategy to improve the biosafety of LVs involves deletion of the
promoter and enhancer elements located in the 30 -LTR U3 region of the transfer
plasmid. Vectors containing this deletion are called self-inactivating (SIN) vectors
because the deletion is copied from the 30 -LTR to the 50 -LTR during reverse
transcription, resulting in modified LTRs with only weak promoter activity (10 %
of original activity). In addition, this deletion in the 30 -LTR prevents potential
transcriptional activation of any (onco)gene upstream or downstream of the integration site. Moreover, SIN vectors cannot be rescued by WT HIV-1 (Bukovsky
et al. 1999).

4.1.2 Recombinant Adeno-Associated Viral Vectors
Recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors derived from the adenoassociated virus (AAV) have been an attractive gene delivery vehicle since they
were first engineered almost three decades ago (Samulski et al. 1982). The main
reason for this is the unique combination of attractive properties: rAAV vectors
ensure efficient gene transfer in different tissues. rAAV vectors are considered safe
because the AAV virus they are derived from, is a non-pathogenic parvovirus
whose replication depends on co-infection with a lytic helper virus, usually a
member of the adenovirus (Atchison et al. 1965) or herpes virus family (Buller
et al. 1981). rAAV vectors are also devoid of all WT AAV genes, making
reversion to replication competent forms virtually impossible. In addition, compared to adenoviral vectors, the administration of rAAV vectors in vivo usually
does not elicit a host immune response resulting in destruction of the transduced
cells as shown in preclinical studies in small animal models.
rAAV vectors are capable of packaging gene cassettes of 4.5–5 kb (Baekelandt
et al. 2000; Grieger and Samulski 2005). rAAV gene cassettes do not integrate into
the host genome, but they readily persist for months to years in slowly dividing or
nondividing cells. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that rAAV vectors can efficiently transduce a number of somatic tissues, including muscle (Xiao et al. 1996),
liver (Miao et al. 1998), heart (Chu et al. 2004), retina (Hellstrom et al. 2009), and
the CNS (Tenenbaum et al. 2004). To date, the most widely used rAAV vector is
based on the AAV2 serotype, which has however been shown to contain some
drawbacks. rAAV2 transduces neurons efficiently in the immediate vicinity of the
injection site (Passini et al. 2004), but requires multiple injections, convectionenhanced delivery (Bankiewicz et al. 2000; Cunningham et al. 2000) or addition of
agents such as mannitol, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or heparin to
transduce larger brain volumes (Mastakov et al. 2001, 2002; Burger et al. 2005;
Hadaczek et al. 2004). Furthermore, the clinical application of rAAV2/2 may be

Viral Vector-Based Models of Parkinson’s Disease

limited by pre-existing immunity to AAV2, which is present in most humans
(Moskalenko et al. 2000). Finally, rAAV2 mainly targets neurons, although other
cell types in the CNS might also be transduced. The limitations of rAAV2 have
advanced the evaluation of alternative/artificial serotypes with broader cellular
targets, higher transduction efficiencies and potential to evade pre-existing
immunity to the AAV2 capsid (Paterna et al. 2004; Burger et al. 2004; Taymans
et al. 2007; McFarland et al. 2009a; Dodiya et al. 2009).
A possible route to find the ideal rAAV tropism, next to modification of the
rAAV capsid structure by chemical, immunological, or genetic means (Rabinowitz
and Samulski 2000), is exploiting the natural capsid diversity of newly isolated
serotypes by packaging rAAV2 genomes into capsids derived from other human or
non-human AAV isolates (Grimm and Kay 2003). To this end, up until now, most
researchers employ hybrid trans-complementing constructs that encode rep from
AAV2, whereas cap is derived from the serotype displaying the cell tropism of
choice. These hybrid vectors are therefore indicated as rAAV2/5, rAAV2/7, etc.,
where the second number refers to the capsid serotype. Among the more than 120
identified AAV variants that have been isolated from adenovirus stock or from
human/non-human primate tissues, AAV2/1 to AAV2/10 are currently being
developed as recombinant vectors for brain applications (Grimm and Kay 2003;
Rutledge et al. 1998; Gao et al. 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005; Schmidt et al. 2006; Wu
et al. 2006). This major advance in rAAV vectorology has significantly broadened
potential applications of rAAV vectors for clinical gene therapy or disease modeling, and offers more options for the selection of a suitable rAAV variant per
specific application. Recombinant AAV vectors are currently considered as a first
choice option for brain applications both to generate preclinical models of neurodegeneration and for gene therapy. Indeed, rAAV vectors have proven useful to
model diseases such as PD and have also been tested in various phases of clinical
development of gene therapy for PD (Christine et al. 2009; Kaplitt et al. 2007) and
Alzheimer’s disease (Mandel 2010).
Design of rAAV Vectors
Historically, most recombinant AAV vectors were based on serotype 2 (rAAV2/2)
that constitutes the prototype of the genus, and was produced by means of two
plasmids (the transfer and the packaging plasmid) and an infectious adenovirus.
The transfer plasmid carries a transgene expression cassette flanked by the AAV2
inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), which are the only cis-acting elements required
for replication and packaging of the recombinant genome (Samulski et al. 1987).
The ends of the AAV2 genome consist of a 145 nucleotide-long ITR that, due to
the multipalindromic nature of the terminal 125 bases, can fold on itself via
complementary base pairing and form a characteristic T-shaped hairpin structure.
The AAV2 nonstructural (rep) gene and a specific structural (cap) gene that
depends on the serotype used are supplied in trans on the second plasmid, the
so-called packaging plasmid. The adenoviral (Ad) helper functions were originally
supplied by infection of rAAV producer cells with a WT adenovirus. The finding

A. Van der Perren et al.

that Ad helper functions are provided by expression of E1A, E1B, E2A, E4ORF6,
and VA RNAs, enabled subsequent Ad-free production of rAAV vector stocks by
incorporating these sequences into a plasmid (referred to as adeno helper plasmid)
and transfecting it together with the two above-mentioned plasmids. Upon introduction of all these constructs into the producer cells, vector particles are generated (Fig. 1).
Extensive efforts have been focused on developing versatile and scalable
manufacturing processes for rAAV vector production with attention to compatibility with good manufacturing practice (GMP) (Gao et al. 2000; Clark et al. 1995;
Blouin et al. 2004; Wright 2009). In our research group, we optimized a scalable
and flexible serum-free rAAV vector production system, allowing a swift adaptation for production of different serotypes (Lock et al. 2010; Van der Perren et al.
2011, 2014; Toelen et al. 2014).

4.1.3 Adenoviral Vectors
Adenoviral vectors are derived from adenoviruses, DNA viruses with a linear
double- stranded genome of 36 kb. The viral genome encodes for about 50 different proteins, 11 of which are structural and used to build the virion. These
viruses have been isolated from a large number of species, and in humans, they
primarily infect the respiratory airways and the gut causing mild respiratory and
gastroenteric diseases. More than 40 AdV serotypes have been described, some
more widespread than others (Davison et al. 2003). Because of their low pathogenicity and wide tropism, AdV-based vectors could be good candidates for gene
delivery transfer. Unfortunately, the broad pre-existing immunity in the population
prevents the use of vectors derived from the most common serotypes. Furthermore,
the high immunogenicity of AdV proteins severely limits re-administration. To
bypass these problems, AdV are mostly derived from rare serotypes, usually AdV2
or 5. AdV proved to be able to transduce a great variety of post-mitotic cells in the
tissues like lung, skeletal muscle, heart, and brain (Howarth et al. 2010).
Design of Adenoviral Vectors
In first-generation AdV vectors, the early gene 1A (E1A), a regulatory gene
essential for replication, was deleted (Graham and Prevec 1995). To further reduce
the risk of the occurrence of a replication competent virus, E1B and E3, genes that
play a role in modulating AdV-specific immunity, as well as E2 and E4 were
additionally deleted (Campos and Barry 2007). This resulted in a vector system
with a capacity to introduce up to 30 kb of DNA. To produce vector particles,
these deleted genes essential for replication are provided by a helper virus or DNA
construct that provides the missing functions in trans. Vector particles are generated by transfection of the vector construct and a helper virus, or by double
transfection with a packaging construct. Alternatively, AdV vectors can also be
produced using a packaging cell line, which stably expresses the structural and

Viral Vector-Based Models of Parkinson’s Disease

regulatory proteins required for vector assembly (Wang et al. 2009). Efforts are
being made to circumvent the broad pre-existing immunity, which currently limits
the use of this vector type.

4.1.4 Herpes Simplex Vectors
Herpes virus vectors are mainly derived from HSV type1, a very large doublestranded DNA virus of 152 kb. The viral genome encodes for more than 80 different proteins, which can be divided into essential and nonessential genes whether
they are required for viral replication. HSV-1 is spread by contact, infects, and
replicates in the skin or mucous membranes, and is taken up by sensory nerve
terminals where it establishes a latent state, from which the virus can subsequently
be reactivated and spread to other individuals. HSV-1 is endemic and more than
70 % of the people have a specific immune response that is maintained active due
to intermittent reactivation of the infection. The main limitation in the use of HSV1 vectors is the pre-existing immunity in humans, eliminating vector particles and
transduced cells exposing HSV proteins on their surface. A second safety concern
is the presence of latently infected cells, which may, upon transduction, offer a
suitable environment for the HSV vector to recombine with the WT genome.
These limitations have severely limited the range of applications of HSV vectors.
On the other hand, these limitations can be considered as an advantage when using
them as oncolytic vectors, targeting proliferating tumor cells.
Design of Herpes Simplex Vectors
The HSV-1 genome contains a significant portion of viral genes that are considered ‘‘non-essential,’’ which have been removed during vector construction. This
elimination makes room for up to 50–150 kb of DNA depending on the type of
HSV vector, making them the largest carriers among all viral vectors. The genetic
complexibility of the virus genome allows the production of different types of
vectors with different properties. Currently, three classes of vectors are derived
from HSV-1: Conditionally replication competent vectors, replication incompetent
vectors, and amplicon-based vectors (de Silva and Bowers 2009). The first class is
designed by deleting the genes not essential for replication, but important for
pathogenicity. These vectors are capable of replicating only in certain cell types
and tissues in vivo, and are typically used in the development of therapies for
malignant brain tumors (Markert et al. 2000). They are referred as oncolytic HSV1 vectors. For the second class, the replication incompetent vectors, one or more
immediate-early genes essential for lytic replication and reactivation have been
deleted, but they retain the ability to establish latency. For the production of vector
particles, this genetic information is provided in trans by a replication competent
HSV strain, a packaging construct or by a specific packaging cell line that stable
expresses the required proteins. These replication incompetent vectors have been
used for preclinical studies of neurodegenerative diseases and chronic pain (Burton
et al. 2002). To generate the third class, the amplicon-based vectors, a single origin

A. Van der Perren et al.

of replication and a single packaging/cleavage signal from the WT HSV-1 was
incorporated into a standard bacterial plasmid, called the amplicon. A transgene
can be cloned into the amplicon plasmid and defective viral vector particles can be
produced by complementing the necessary genes by a defective helper virus, a
packaging construct, or specific packaging cells (de Silva and Bowers 2009). This
class is the safest as it carries minimal viral sequences, but requires optimization to
increase vector titers.

4.2 From Viral Vector to Animal Models
4.2.1 Viral Vector-Based a-Synuclein Overexpression Models
Overexpression of a-synuclein by direct targeting of the SN of rats, mice, or nonhuman primates with viral vectors offers a valuable alternative approach to the
a-synuclein transgenic mice. Using viral vectors, high transgene expression levels
can be achieved, which might be crucial since the disease onset and severity
depends on the level of a-synuclein expression. Two vector systems have been
explored for this purpose: rAAV and LV (Table 2).
The viral vector approach was initially explored almost simultaneously by a
number of different groups using either rAAV2/2 or LV vectors (Kirik et al. 2002;
Klein et al. 2002; Lauwers et al. 2003; Lo Bianco et al. 2002). In rats injection of
rAAV2/2 vectors expressing either WT, A30P, or A53T mutant human a-synuclein unilaterally into the SN (Kirik et al. 2002; Klein et al. 2002) induced efficient
expression of a-synuclein in nigral DN, accompanied by cellular and axonal
pathologies and nigral DN loss that developed progressively over time. These firstgeneration rAAV2/2-based a-synuclein models displayed progressive neurodegeneration, but the loss of the nigral TH-positive neurons (25–80 %) as well as the
time course described was quite variable (6 weeks up to 1 year) (Kirik et al. 2002;
Klein et al. 2002). LV vectors encoding WT, A30P, or A53T mutant a-synuclein
were also capable of inducing neuronal cell loss in rats, but less pronounced and
more delayed (24–35 % cell loss at 5 months) (Lo Bianco et al. 2002). Dystrophic
neurites and swollen perikarya were detected in the remaining DNs and cytoplasmic accumulations of a-synuclein were found in cell bodies as well as in
neurites. Many attempts were made to reproduce and improve these rat models
using rAAV2/2 (Yamada et al. 2004; Maingay et al. 2006; Mochizuki et al. 2006;
Chung et al. 2009) or LV (Lauwers et al. 2007), but similar results were obtained.
Both LV and rAAV vectors have also been used in mice. Work from our own
group showed that injection of LV-WT and A30P a-synuclein in different mouse
brain regions (striatum, amygdala, SN) induced time-dependent neuropathological
changes including neuritic enlargements and cytoplasmic inclusions. Furthermore,
nigral overexpression of A30P a-synuclein resulted in a 10–25 % cell loss at
10–12 months (Lauwers et al. 2003). In another study, nigral injection of rAAV2/2
WT a-synuclein induced a 25 % cell loss at 24 weeks; however, no obvious

Viral Vector-Based Models of Parkinson’s Disease

cytoplasmic inclusions were detected in the a-synuclein expressing cells (St
Martin et al. 2007). Overall, the pathology observed in mice, both the onset and the
severity, appeared less severe compared to the described rat models. rAAV vectors
were also applied in non-human primates. Sixteen weeks after nigral injection of
rAAV2/2 WT or A53T a-synuclein, 30–60 % of the nigral cells were lost, which
resulted in mild motor deficits (Kirik et al. 2003).
The limitations of rAAV2/2 have prompted the evaluation of alternative serotypes with broader cellular targets and higher transduction efficiencies. As a result,
other serotypes, notably rAAV2/5, rAAV2/6, rAAV2/8, and rAAV1/2, have been
used in rats and non-human primates to overexpress a-synuclein (Eslamboli et al.
2007; Gorbatyuk et al. 2008; Azeredo da Silveira et al. 2009; Sanchez-Guajardo
et al. 2010; Koprich et al. 2011; McFarland et al. 2009a). Since phosphorylation of
a-synuclein at serine 129 is a common feature in patients suffering of synucleinopathies, mutations mimicking a-synuclein phosphorylation might also enhance
dopaminergic pathology. Mutations mimicking (S129D) or preventing phosphorylation (S129A) have been expressed using rAAV2/5, rAAV2/6, and rAAV2/8 in
the rat SN (Gorbatyuk et al. 2008; Azeredo da Silveira et al. 2009; McFarland et al.
2009b). Interestingly, in the studies using rAAV2/5 and rAAV2/6, the S129A
mutation, which can no longer be phosphorylated, showed enhanced toxicity (70 %
cell loss at 4 weeks) compared to WT (60 % cell loss at 26 weeks), while the
S129D mutant showed reduced or no toxicity (Gorbatyuk et al. 2008; Azeredo da
Silveira et al. 2009). With rAAV2/8, the a-synuclein mediated toxicity was
equivalent for WT as well as both S129 mutants (26 % at 6 weeks) (McFarland
et al. 2009b), an observation potentially explained by different expression levels
obtained by rAAV2/8 compared to rAAV2/5 or rAAV2/6 in the substantia nigra
(Van der Perren et al. 2011). rAAV1/2 (chimeric vector) driven overexpression of
A53T a-synuclein in the SN of rats caused a dopaminergic cell loss of 28 % at
6 weeks (Koprich et al. 2011). In this study, the choice of the vector titer was
crucial since too high vector titers caused unspecific toxic effects. These secondgeneration rAAV-based a-synuclein rat models display a more reproducible neurodegeneration (15–60 % loss 6–26 weeks p.i.) (Gorbatyuk et al. 2008; Azeredo da
Silveira et al. 2009; Sanchez-Guajardo et al. 2010; Koprich et al. 2011). However,
even in these rat models, the time course and loss of the nigral TH-positive neurons
still suffered from variability, which hindered clear motor deficits.
Different species of a-synuclein could also influence the levels of pathology.
Winner et al. evaluated two artificial mutants of a-synuclein (E57K, E35K) with
the propensity to form oligomeric aggregates and one faster fibril forming mutant
of a-synuclein (a-SYN 30-110) in vivo (Winner et al. 2011). E57K and E35K
mutant a-synuclein were delivered in the rat SN using LV and resulted in a
dopaminergic loss of, respectively, 51 % and 50 %, which turned out to be more
toxic than WT (32 %), A30P (38 %), E46K (40 %), and A53T (17 %) a-synuclein
at 3 weeks p.i. Remarkably, the faster fibril forming mutant A53T did not show a
significant decrease in dopaminergic cell number. These data further support the
idea that the oligomeric species and not the fibrillar form of synuclein are toxic and

A. Van der Perren et al.

contribute to dopaminergic degeneration. Although being very instrumental, the
dopaminergic cell loss of 17–50 % in these LV-based rat models is insufficient for
behavioral manifestations, which require at least 60–70 % cell loss. In non-human
primates, better results were obtained. Overexpression of WT or A53T mutant
a-synuclein using rAAV2/5 resulted in a clear difference at the behavioral and
morphological level (Eslamboli et al. 2007). Stronger motor impairments were
observed in the A53T group compared to the WT group 42 weeks after injection.
After 1 year, TH-positive fiber loss was observed in the striatum of both groups,
but it was more pronounced in the A53T group. In both groups, the remaining
fibers were dystrophic and contained a-synuclein positive insoluble inclusions.
Many a-synuclein positive aggregates were found to be phosphorylated at serine
129. When analyzing the SN, a loss of up to 40 % of the DNs was observed in the
A53T a-synuclein animals in contrast to WT a-synuclein animals, which only
differed in two out of eight animals from the eGFP control animals. Furthermore,
at 1 year p.i. ubiquitin positive inclusions were detected in the surviving nigral
neurons of both groups.
To summarize, viral vector-mediated a-synuclein models display synuclein
pathology and clear dopaminergic neurodegeneration in contrast to a-synuclein
transgenic mice. The transgene expression in DN achieved with the novel rAAV
serotypes (rAAV2/5, 2/6, 2/8, and 2/1) is improved compared to rAAV2/2 and
substantially higher compared to LV probably due to their high titers and tropism
for DN neurons, resulting in higher levels of neurodegeneration. Although
promising, these models still suffer from a certain degree of variability, a slow
progression of the phenotype and lack overt behavioral impairments, hindering
their usefulness for testing novel therapeutics.
To address these issues, a third generation of a-synuclein models has been
developed by optimizing the promoter, the rAAV serotype, the vector construct, as
well as the vector titer and purity of the vector preparation. Decressac et al.
reported progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration up to 75 % at 8–16 weeks
after nigral injection of rAAV2/6 using the neuron specific synapsin-1 promoter to
drive the expression of WT a-synuclein (Decressac et al. 2012). The cell loss was
preceded by degenerative changes of striatal axons and terminals, and the presence
of a-synuclein positive inclusions in dystrophic axons and dendrites. This high
level of neurodegeneration resulted in clear behavioral deficits seen in the cylinder
test and the amphetamine-induced rotation test. Our group has recently shown that
rAAV2/7 outperformed most serotypes in terms of transduction efficiency and
expression levels in rat SN (Van der Perren et al. 2011). Based on these data, we
developed a rat model for PD by injection of rAAV2/7 encoding A53T a-synuclein
into the SN (Fig. 2) (Van der Perren et al. 2014). High a-synuclein expression was
observed four days post-injection. At least 90 % of the DNs were transduced,
which resulted in progressive nigrostriatal pathology up to 80 % and behavioral
deficits in 4 weeks’ time period. Levodopa (L-dopa) was found to reverse the
behavioral phenotype. Non-invasive PET and MR imaging allowed longitudinal
monitoring of neurodegeneration. In addition, ubiquitin positive a-synuclein
aggregates were detected. This rat PD model successfully recapitulates the

progressive degeneration of DN and associated motor deficits together with the
formation of a-synuclein inclusions. In parallel to this study, we also showed that
strong and significant a-synuclein-induced neuropathology and progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration can be achieved in mouse brain by means of rAAV2/7
(Oliveras-Salva et al. 2013). We noted a significant and dose-dependent a-synucleinopathy over time upon nigral viral vector-mediated a-synuclein overexpression.
We obtained a strong, progressive, and dose-dependent loss of DNs in the SN,
reaching a maximum of 82 % after 8 weeks. When comparing wild-type to A53T
mutant a-synuclein at the same vector dose, both induced a similar degree of
dopaminergic cell death (Oliveras-Salva et al. 2013). These major improvements can
probably be explained by the choice of the rAAV7 serotype, the use of the CMV
enhanced synapsin-1 promoter, and the vector titer combined with an optimized
vector preparation. We believe that these improved rodent models will be of great
value for further development and testing of neuroprotective strategies.

4.2.2 Viral Vector-Based LRRK2 Overexpression Models
rAAV are not suitable for the delivery of the 7581 bp LRRK2 cDNA to the
nigrostriatal system due to their limited packaging capacity. Even for LV, the size
of the LRRK2 cDNA is approaching the packaging limitations. Our group has
succeeded to generate functional LRRK2 LV (Civiero et al. 2012), however, with
reduced titers, which compromises the chances to induce phenotypic effects
in vivo. To date, two groups have reported the generation of viral vector-mediated
LRRK2 PD models using either recombinant adenoviral (rAdv) or herpes simplex
vectors (HSV) (Table 3) (Dusonchet et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2010). rAd vectors
expressing WT or G2019S mutant LRRK2 were injected into six sites within the
rat striatum and nigral transduction relied on retrograde transport of the vector.
Quantification of the expression levels revealed that 31 % of the nigral DN were
transduced. Injection of Adv encoding mutant G2019S LRRK2 resulted in progressive loss of nigral DN up to 10 % after 10 days and 21 % after 42 days. WT
LRRK2 rAdv did not induce any degeneration. No abnormal a-synuclein accumulation, ubiquitinated, or phosphorylated aggregates were found in WT or
G2019S LRRK2 expressing neurons in the SN (Dusonchet et al. 2011). Lee et al.
generated an LRRK2 mouse model using HSV vectors (Lee et al. 2010). HSV
vectors encoding WT LRRK2, G2019S, or G2019S/D1994A LRRK2 were
injected into the mouse striatum resulting in a retrograde transduction of 75 % of
the nigral neurons. Three weeks after injection, overexpression of G2019S LRRK2
induced a progressive loss of 50 % of the nigral DN. G2019S-D1994A (kinase
dead) LRRK2 caused no neuronal loss, similar to WT LRRK2 and GFP control
vectors. These data link LRRK2 toxicity to elevated kinase activity in vivo.

4.2.3 Viral Vector-Based Parkin, DJ-1, and PINK1
Knockdown Models
Since parkin, PINK1, and DJ-1 KO mice do not display a clear phenotype, viral
vector-mediated gene silencing in the adult brain could be explored as an alternative
strategy. Stable knockdown of gene expression can be achieved by viral vectormediated RNA interference after stereotactic injection into the brain (Ulusoy et al.
2009). Adult knockdown with viral vector technology has not been published for
parkin or DJ-1. Haque et al. achieved a shRNA-mediated knockdown of PINK1 of
71 % in the striatum and 68 % in the SN by stereotactic striatal injection using an
adenoviral vector in adult rats (Haque et al. 2012). This knockdown of PINK1 in the
SN increased the sensitivity to MPTP administration, resulting in an increased loss of
DN in the SN and terminal dopaminergic fibers in the striatum. Knockdown of
PINK1 by itself, however, did not affect the number of DN in this 3-week time frame
(Table 3) (Haque et al. 2012). Recent observations from our own group have confirmed that knockdown of PINK1 (Oliveras-Salvá et al. 2014) or even parkin using
rAAV2/7 in adult mouse or rat SN up to 10 months does not elicit significant
dopaminergic cell death (unpublished data).

However, an elegant alternative approach was recently pursued by adult
knockout of parkin after injection of an LV expressing GFP-Cre into the SN of
6- to 8-week-old conditional parkin knockout mice (exon 7 flanked by loxP sites,
parkinFLX/FLX). Injection of LV GFP-Cre led to a near complete loss of parkin in
the ventral midbrain of parkinFlx/Flx animals, resulting in a significant reduction in
nigral DN up to 45 % after 10 months (Shin et al. 2011).

5 Conclusions and Perspectives
Much effort has been spent over the last 10 years on the development and
improvement of viral vector-based PD models. So far, models based on overexpression of a-synuclein are the most prevalent and extensively studied. The firstgeneration a-synuclein models have learned that the levels of a-synuclein
expression crucially determine the disease onset and severity, and are important to
elicit reliable motor impairments. Since then, efforts have been focused on
increasing expression levels of a-synuclein in the DN, which has resulted in
second- and third-generation models. rAAV vectors have gradually outcompeted
LV vectors because of their higher titers and transduction efficiency of DN. The
best models currently available have been developed from a combined approach
using newer AAV serotypes (rAAV1, 5, 6, 7, 8) and optimized vector constructs,
titer, and purity. These third-generation a-synuclein models show improved face
and predictive validity and therefore offer the possibility to reliably test novel
therapeutics.
Besides being useful for preclinical drug testing, the viral vector-based
a-synuclein models have allowed to examine important aspects of a-synuclein
pathophysiology, such as a-synuclein phosphorylation, toxicity of a-synuclein
oligomers versus fibrils, etc. Furthermore, differences in sensitivity of DN among
animal species have been detected. Compared to rats, mice DN seem to be less
sensitive to a-synuclein overexpression, resulting in a delayed manifestation of
neurodegeneration. This is in line with observations in a-synuclein transgenic mice
where dopaminergic degeneration is largely absent. However, a comparison with
a-synuclein transgenic rats would be required to rule out whether this is genuinely
due to different protective mechanisms between mice and rats rather than to differences in levels or age-of-onset of the a-synuclein overexpression.
Comparing models created across different laboratories remains difficult since
different vector systems, serotypes, and production methods are being used. The
vector titer as well as the vector purity directly influences the phenotypic outcome
of the model. Excessive vector titers or insufficiently purified vector batches may
result in a specific toxicity. Therefore, appropriate control vectors are indispensable. Considerable time investment in the viral vector production, upscaling, and
purification procedures has also proven essential to obtain reproducible and high
quality vector batches.

Viral Vector-Based Models of Parkinson’s Disease

Rodent models based on overexpression of G2019S LRRK2 display mild
(10 %) to severe (50 %) neurodegeneration depending on the vector system
(AdV5 or HSV) used. A disadvantage of the AdV5-based rat model is the low
percentage of retrogradely transduced nigral neurons (31 %) compared to the
75 % obtained in mice using HSV. Importantly, both models have provided
in vivo evidence for the link between G2019S LRRK2 toxicity and elevated kinase
activity, which reinforces the concept of LRRK2 kinase inhibition as a possible
therapeutic strategy.
RNAi-mediated viral vector-based knockdown offers in principle an interesting
tool to study recessive genes like parkin, DJ-1, and PINK1. However, until now,
only one study related to PINK1 has been published applying this approach. This
might partially be explained by difficulties to detect and quantify knockdown
levels in vivo due to the lack of reliable antibodies or other detection methods of
endogenous protein. Nevertheless, the knockdown approach with viral vectors still
represents an attractive and flexible strategy to combine with overexpression/
knockdown of other PD-related genes or also in combination with transgenic
animals in order to determine whether these proteins act in similar pathways
in vivo.
