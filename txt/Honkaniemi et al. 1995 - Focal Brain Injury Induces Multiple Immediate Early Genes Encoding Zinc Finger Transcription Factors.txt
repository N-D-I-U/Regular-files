Abstract

Focal brain injury is known to markedly induce the fos and jun families of immediate early genes (IEGs). This study
employed in situ hybridization to examine the effects of focal brain injury, produced by the intracerebral injection of saline or
ibotenic acid on the expression of IEGs encoding zinc finger transcription factors. Thirty minutes after the injections, NGFI-A,
NGFI-B, NGFI-C, and egr-3mRNAs were induced in dentate gyrus, hippocampal pyramidal cells, cerebral cortex, caudate-putamen and piriform cortex of the injured hemisphere. Nurrl was induced in hippocampal pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells.
After three hours the induction of NGFI-A, NGFI-B, NGFI-C and Nurrl persisted in all brain regions except for the dentate
granule cells. By six hours after injection mRNAs for most of the zinc finger genes had returned to control levels. However, the
expression of egr-3 3 and 6 h after the injection was identical to that observed at 30 min after the injection and it was the only
gene the expression of which persisted 6 h following the injections. Twenty-four hours after the injection, the expression of all
five lEGs returned to control levels. In general, no gross differences in the IEG induction were observed between the animals
injected with saline and ibotenic acid. Since these zinc finger genes were expressed in the same regions where fos and jun family
members are induced by similar types of brain injury, it is suggested that these transcription factors may act in concert with
Fos/Jun family members. These observations should be considered when studying the effect of invasive manipulations on IEG
expression in the brain and add to the evidence for remote effects of focal brain injury.

1. Introduction

The los and jun families of immediate early genes
(IEGs) respond rapidly and transiently to various types
of stimulation in the central nervous system. The Fos
(Fos, FosB, F r a l and Fra2) and Jun (Jun, JunB, JunD)
family m e m b e r s form dimers which bind to specific
D N A sequences and thereby regulate the expression of
target genes [24]. Their expression in the brain has
been used as markers of increased activity [30]. Expres-

sion of los and jun genes can also be induced in the
brain by various types of injury [6,7,8,32]. Dragunow et
al. [6,7,8] demonstrated that focal brain injury caused
by needle implantation and intracerebral saline injections leads to massive induction of the los/jun genes
in the injured hemisphere. The mechanism of l E G
induction by penetrating brain injury may involve
spreading depression and release of excitatory amino
acids [32].
In contrast to the data describing the localization
and induction of the fos/jun l E G s in the nervous
system, relatively little is known about the l E G s encoding proteins containing zinc finger motifs. The zinc
finger motif is a common D N A binding structure, and
proteins containing zinc fingers are capable of binding
to a variety of D N A sequences [16,27,29]. Some of

and Northern blotting.

2. Materials and m e t h o d s
2.1. Animal treatments
Thirty-six adult male Sprague-Dawley rats divided into 9 groups
of 4 animals each were used for in situ hybridization, Three addi-

tional animals were used for Northern blotting. For in situ hybridization the rats were injected under chloral hydrate anesthesia (250
mg/kg) either with 10 p,l of normal saline or with 10 /zl of ibotenic
acid (1 /xg//zl in normal saline) into the right hippocampus-striatum
(approximate coordinates bregma -3.5 mm, lateral 2.5 ram, ventral
4-7 mm according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson [28]). The
animals were killed by decapitation 30 min (n = 4 for saline injected
animals and n = 4 for ibotenic acid injected animals), 3 h (n = 4 and
4), 6 h (n = 4 and 4) or 24 h (n = 4 and 4) after the injection. Four
intact animals that had no surgery performed were used as controls.
2.2. In situ hybridization
After decapitation the brains were removed and frozen on dry
ice. Four to five brains were frozen in the same chuck. Each chuck
was composed from brains representing each time point after either
saline or ibotenic acid injection. Four chucks contained also brain
obtained from control animal. Fourteen micrometer thick coronal
sections were cut with a Microm HM 500 cryostat at Bregma levels
-2.0 to -4.5 and mounted onto Fisherbrand Superfrost/Plus slides
(Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, USA). The location of the injections
was verified from the sections. The sections were stored at -20°C.
In situ hybridization was performed as previously described [5]. Four
sections cut from each chuck were hybridized with each oligonucleotide probe. The oligonucleotide probes complementary to the mRNAs encoding rat NGFI-A (nucleotides 1666-1711 [23]), mouse
NGFI-B (nucleotides 182-227 [11]), rat NGFI-C (nucleotides 418461 [3]), mouse egr-3 (nucleotides 189-234 [26]) and mouse Nurrl
(nucleotides 733-777 [20]) were labelled at the 3'-end with [35S]dATP
(DuPont-NEN Research Products, Boston, USA) using terminal
deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Amersham Int., Buckinghamshire, UK).
The sections were air dried at room temperature and subsequently
hybridized at 42°C for 18 h with a mixture of 4xSSC, 50% formamide, l xDenhardt's solution, 1% sarcosyl, 0.02 M phosphate
buffer (pH 7.0), 10% dextran sulphate, 500 p,g/ml heat-denaturated
salmon sperm DNA, 200 mM dithiothreitol and 1 x 107 cpm/ml of
the labelled probe. After hybridization, the sections were washed 4
times for 15 min each in I×SSC at 55°C and thereafter left to cool
for 1-3 h at room temperature. The sections were then dipped in
distilled water and subsequently in 50, 60 and 90% ethanol and air
dried at room temperature. The sections were covered with Amersham /3-max autoradiography film (Amersham Int.). After exposing
the films 4 weeks for NGFI-A, NGFI-C and egr-3 and 6 weeks for
NGFI-B and Nurrl they were developed using LX24 developer and
AL4 fixative (Kodak, Rochester, USA).
2.3. Northern blotting
Pieces of hippocampus and cortex obtained from intact rats and
rats which had received bilateral intracerebral injections of saline 30
rain before decapitation were homogenized with a polytron in a
mixture of 6 M guanidium isothiocyanate, 8% 2-mercaptoethanol, 50
mM Tris-HCl and 10 mM EDTA. LiCI was added to the homogenate
and nucleic acids were allowed to precipitate overnight at + 4°C. The
samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at + 4°C for 90 min and
resuspended in a solution consisting of 4 M urea, 2 M LiCI and 1
mM EDTA. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at+4°C for 90 rain,
the precipitate was incubated with DNAse (0.2 U/~zl; Promega,
Madison, USA) and RNAsin (1 U//zl; Promega) at+37°C for 60
min and subsequently in proteinase K (0.2 g/l; Sigma) at + 37°C for
60 min. Total RNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform. The RNA
was precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in 1 mM EDTA and the
optical densities were measured at 260 nm. Five /zg of RNA for
NGFI-A, NGFI-B, NGFI-C and egr-3 and 10 ~g for Nurrl was
electrophoresed into 1.5% agarose gel containing 1 x MOPS and 7%
paraformaldehyde and thereafter transferred to a nylon membrane
(Nytran, Sleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) for 24-48 h. The RNA

J. Honkaniemi et al. /Molecular Brain Research 28 (1995) 157-163
was immobilized to the membrane with UV light at 254 nm. The
membrane was stained with 0.02% Methylene blue and the position
of the 18S and 28S bands were marked. The membrane was prehybridized at 37°C for 1-3 h with the same mixture used for in situ
hybridization, except that the concentration of salmon sperm DNA
was 250 ~tg/ml. The oligonucleotide probes used above were labelled at the 3'-end with [32p]dATP (DuPont-NEN Research Products) using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Amersham Int.)
and about 1.5 × 108 of the labelled probe was added to the hybridization solution. To verify that equal amounts of each RNA sample
were loaded into the gel, [32p]dATP-labelled oligonucleotide probe
against cyclophilin was added to the hybridization mixture. The
membranes were hybridized at+37°C overnight and thereafter

159

washed at + 37°C for 3 h with increasing stringencies with the maximum stringency of 0.2xSSC and 0.1% SDS. The membranes were
then covered with Kodak SB5 autoradiograhic film for 12 h to 7 days
and the film developed with Kodak GBX developer and fixative.

In contrast, egr-3 continued to be expressed in the
cerebral cortex, piriform cortex, caudate-putamen and
dentate granule cells for 6 h and returned to control
levels 24 h after the injection (data not shown). The
patterns of gene expression at each of the time points
(n = 4 for each time) were virtually identical for all of
the saline injected animals in the group. However, in
one animal killed 24 h after saline injection there was
increased NGFI-A and egr-3 expression in cortex and
caudate-putamen and increased NGFI-C expression in
cortex (data not shown).
Hippocampal ibotenic acid injections generally induced the lEGs in the same patterns and with the
same time course as subjects injected with saline. There
were two exceptions, however. In one animal there was
marked bilateral induction of NGFI-A, NGFI-B,
NGFI-C, Nurrl and egr-3 (data not shown) in the
dentate gyrus 30 min after ibotenic acid injection. In
another animal, there was massive induction of NGFIA and NGFI-B in the cortex and NGFI-C and egr-3
(data not shown) in the cerebral cortex, piriform cortex
and caudate-putamen 6 h after the ibotenic acid injection. This cortical induction was significantly higher
than the cortical expression in any of the other animals
at any of the time points studied.
The specificity of the oligonucleotide probes was
confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Total RNA ob-

only in the medial habenula, layer 6 of the cortex and
layers CA1-CA3 of the hippocampus. Thirty min after
injection of saline into dorsal hippocampus, NGFI-A,
NGFI-B, NGFI-C, egr-3 and Nurrl mRNAs were substantially increased in several brain areas of the injured
hemisphere. No significant changes in the lEG expression were observed in the contralateral hemisphere as
compared with the expression in intact rat brain. The
greatest increase for all five lEGs occurred in the
dentate gyrus. NGFI-A, NGFI-B, NGFI-C and egr-3
expression also increased in cerebral cortex, caudateputamen and piriform cortex. In hippocampus, NGFI-A
and NGFI-B were slightly induced in CA1 pyramidal
neurons, whereas the NGFI-C and Nurrl mRNAs were
modestly induced in CA1-CA3 pyramidal neurons.
NGFI-A and NGFI-B were also induced in the PVN
and in the meninges. Three hours after the injections,
the levels of NGFI-A, NGFI-B and NGFI-C mRNA
were still slightly elevated in hippocampal CA1-CA3
pyramidal cells, cerebral cortex, piriform cortex and
caudate-putamen. Nurrl expression remained elevated
in hippocampal CA1, 2 and 3 pyramidal neurons. In
the dentate gyrus the expression of NGFI-A, NGFI-B,
NGFI-C and Nurrl had returned to control levels by 3
h. Six hours after the injection, the expression of
NGFI-A, NGFI-B, NGFI-C and Nurrl in all brain
regions was similar similar to that in the-intact animals.

tained from hippocampus and cortex of intact rats and

which were used for in situ hybridization. Single bands
of expected molecular size were seen in hippocampal
and cortical samples obtained from control and saline
injected rats (Fig. 2).

4. Discussion

Intracerebral injections of saline or ibotenic acid
markedly induced the five zinc finger lEGs examined
in this study. The mRNAs encoded by these genes
were induced in cerebral cortex, piriform cortex, caudate-putamen and hippocampus of the injured hemisphere, with the greatest increases occurring in the
dentate gyrus. No changes in the lEG mRNA levels
were observed in the contralateral hemisphere. This
indicates that the lEG induction was caused by the
injury and not by the stress caused by animal handling,
anesthesia etc. Furthermore, these results demonstrate
that focal brain injury, unlike stress [15], is capable of
inducing all of these zinc finger genes in the brain. The
results of the present study extend previous findings by
Dragunow et al. [7] demonstrating the inducibility of
NGFI-A and certain members of the los/jun family in
the brain after focal brain injury.
With the exception of Nurrl, the localization of
these zinc finger lEGs in normal rat brain was strikingly similar: low to moderate mRNA levels were observed in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and caudate-putamen. The induction of NGFI-A, NGFI-B,
NGFI-C and egr-3 caused by focal injury occurred in
these same brain areas. This suggests that the protein
products of these genes may act in concert with each
other and with the members of the Fos and Jun family.
However, there were some significant differences in
the time course of induction and localization of these
lEG mRNAs. First, the localization of Nurrl in intact
brain was clearly different from the other genes. Furthermore, the induction of Nurrl appeared to be specific to hippocampus in contrast to the hippocampal
and cortico-striatal induction of NGFI-A, NGFI-B,
NGFI-C and egr-3. Second, the rapid and massive
induction of NGFI-A, NGFI-B, NGFI-C and Nurrl in
the dentate gyrus disappeared by 3 h after the injection, whereas egr-3 mRNA continued to be expressed
for 6 h in dentate, egr-3 was also induced for 6 h in
cerebral cortex, piriform cortex and caudate-putamen,
at a time when NGFI-A, NGFI-B, NGFI-C and Nurrl
mRNAs had returned to basal levels. This sequential
expression of genes encoding transcription factors may
in turn lead to a sequential expression or repression of
target genes at different time points. Thus, Egr-3 may
serve as a late response transcription factor affecting

161

the transcription of late response target genes. Interestingly, the binding sequence of Egr-3 is the same as
that of NGFI-A and NGFI-C. Therefore, one role of
Egr-3 may be to regulate the same target genes as
NGFI-A and NGFI-C, except that Egr-3 would be
affecting the same target genes at later times when
expression of NGFI-A and NGFI-C had returned to
control levels. The finding that the induction of Nurrl
is restricted to the hippocampus suggests that there are
specific zinc finger genes that might have hippocampal
specific target genes.
A significant induction of NGFI-A and NGFI-B, but
not of NGFI-C, egr-3 and Nurrl, was also seen in the
PVN. This may reflect the stress produced by the
surgery and intracranial injections in these animals,
and is consistent with our previous studies demonstrating that stress induces NGFI-A and NGFI-B, but not
NGFI-C, Nurrl or egr-3, in the PVN [15]. NGFI-A and
NGFI-B mRNA levels were also increased in the
meninges, which might be due to the effects of stress,
release of factors from the damaged neuronal and glial
cells, from bleeding into the subarachnoid space, or
other unknown factors.
The target genes of the transcription factors being
studied are largely unknown. One set of genes might
be members of the NGF family of neurotrophic factors. Ballarln et al. [1] showed that focal brain injury
produced by inserting a needle into the brain and
intracerebral saline injection induce NGF and brain
derived growth factor (BDNF) in dentate granule cells
and piriform cortex 1 h after the injury. This increase is
preceded by a massive induction of c-fos in the same
area suggesting a role of c-fos in stimulating the transcription of NGF and BDNF. Indeed, the first intron
of the NGF gene contains an active AP-1 site recognized by Fos/Jun dimers, through which Fos is capable
of stimulating the transcription of NGF [12]. In the
present study we demonstrate a substantial increase of
zinc finger containing transcription factors in dentate
granule cells and piriform cortex 30 min after intracerebral injection. These zinc finger transcription factors could also participate in the induction of NGF and
BDNF. It is not known whether the NGF and BDNF
genes contain the cis-acting sequences recognized by
the zinc finger transcription factors. However, even the
absence of such sequences does not necessarily indicate that these transcription factors are not capable of
regulating the transcription of these genes, since other
mechanisms including protein-protein interactions between different transcription factors, may be involved.
This type of interaction has been demonstrated between Fos/Jun proteins and the glucocorticoid receptor. The glucocorticoid receptor is a zinc finger containing transcription factor belonging to the
steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily [9], which is capable of interacting with the Fos-Jun dimers through the

162

J. Honkaniemi et al. / Molecular Brain Research 28 (1995) 157-163

zinc finger domain [17]. The localization of the members of the F o s / J u n families and the zinc finger lEGs
in the same brain regions after focal brain injury opens
up the possibility of the interactions between F o s / J u n
family members and the zinc finger transcription factors in regulating N G F a n d / o r BDNF transcription.
The key event in triggering the expression of these
IEGs appears to be the trauma associated with insertion of the needle. In a subsequent series of experiments we have observed a similar induction after needle implantation only into the brain (Bontiempi et al.
unpublished observations). These implants were performed with the guidance of a stereotaxic apparatus,
which resulted in a more consistent localization of the
lesion and time course of the IEG expression. Thus,
the slight variations seen between the animals in the
present study might be due to differences in location of
injection and severity of injury. The widespread expression of lEGs may seriously interfere with studies that
involve invasive manipulations of the brain, e.g. intracerebral and intracerebroventricular injections and electrode implantation. Lee and Bondy [21] have demonstrated that even craniotomy and meningeal disruption
alone results in widespread induction of NGFI-A in
ipsilateral cortex. Therefore, the results obtained after
invasive manipulations of the brain have to be carefully
compared with sham-operated controls or, alternatively, chronically implanted animals may have to be
used.
Several types of brain insults including penetrating
brain injury induce spreading depression in the brain.
Spreading depression is initiated by an intense high
frequency burst followed by a silent period after which
the neurons gradually recover. In rats, the suppression
of electrical activity spreads across the cortex within
minutes. Spreading depression is characterized by disruption in ion homeostasis, recurrant waves of neuronal depolarization and endogenous release of neurotransmitters which further act on their specific receptors [19]. The resultant release of excitatory amino
acids appears to play a central role in l E G expression,
since N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, such as MK-801, abolish spreading depression
[22,25] and also abolish the cortical injury-caused induction of c-los [6,14,32]. These previous c-los results
would suggest that prior administration of MK-801
might also block induction of these zinc finger lEGs, if
the mechanism of induction is in fact related to the
spreading depression.
We did not observe any difference in cortical or
hippocampal l E G expression after intracerebral saline
and ibotenic acid injections. This is consistent with the
hypothesis that both types of injections initiated
spreading depression which was responsible for the
IEG induction. This would also account for l E G induction throughout dorsal and ventral hippocampus and

cortex, in regions far away from the single injection
sites. This also suggests that the increased neuronal
death caused by the ibotenic acid injection does not
significantly increase the induction caused by focal
penetrating brain injury. However, two of the ibotenic
injected animals did have more massive or prolonged
l E G induction. This may be due to the variation in the
injection site or suggest that ibotenic acid might have
some additive effects on lEG induction in some subjects.
The present report demonstrates that trauma induces multiple IEGs encoding zinc finger proteins in
the brain. All five lEGs were induced predominantly in
the hippocampus, though there were some differences
among the five genes in localization in other brain
regions and in the time course of the induction. This
lEG induction produced by mechanical trauma must
be taken into account when studying the effect of acute
invasive manipulations on l E G expression. These results extend the cis-acting DNA elements affected by
focal brain injury from the widely studied AP-1 binding
sequence to the less extensively characterized sequences recognized by the zinc finger transcription
factors and thus they may widen the spectrum of target
genes involved. The data might also suggest that there
are zinc finger lEGs which are specifically induced in
the hippocampus (Nurrl), and therefore perhaps hippocampal specific target genes.
