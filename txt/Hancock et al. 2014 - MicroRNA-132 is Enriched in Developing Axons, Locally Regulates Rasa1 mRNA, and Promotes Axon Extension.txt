Regulates Rasa1 mRNA, and Promotes Axon Extension

Developing axons can locally synthesize proteins, with roles in axon growth, guidance, and regeneration, but the mechanisms that
regulate axonal mRNA translation are not well understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of translation but have still
been little characterized in developing axons. Here we study mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) axons and show that their extension is
impaired by conditional deficiency of the miRNA-processing enzyme Dicer in vitro and in vivo. A screen for axonal localization identifies
a specific set of miRNAs preferentially enriched within the developing axon. High axonal expression and preferential localization were
observed for miR-132, a miRNA previously known for roles in dendrites and dysregulation in major neurologic diseases. miR-132
knockdown reduced extension of cultured DRG axons, whereas overexpression increased extension. Mechanistically, miR-132 regulated
the mRNA for the Ras GTPase activator Rasa1, a novel target in neuronal function. Moreover, miR-132 regulation of Rasa1 translation was
seen in severed axons, demonstrating miRNA function locally within the axon. miR-132 expression in DRGs peaked in the period of
maximum axon growth in vivo, consistent with its effect on axon growth, and suggesting a role as a developmental timer. Together, these
findings identify miR-132 as a positive regulator of developing axon extension, acting through repression of Rasa1 mRNA, in a mechanism that operates locally within the axon.

Introduction
Developing axons contain protein synthesis machinery and a specific set of mRNAs, and roles for local axonal mRNA translation
have been described in axon growth, guidance, and regeneration
(Hengst and Jaffrey, 2007; Yoo et al., 2010; Jung et al., 2012).
However, the mechanisms that regulate axonal mRNA translation are still not well understood.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ⬃22 nt RNAs that act as translation regulators, typically initiating both mRNA degradation and
translational repression (Baek et al., 2008; Bartel, 2009). miRNAs
are highly expressed in the nervous system and have been studied
extensively in neuron differentiation, dendrite growth, and synaptic function (Fineberg et al., 2009; Im and Kenny, 2012; McNeill and Van Vactor, 2012), but are less characterized in the
developing axon. Evidence that miRNAs function in axon development initially came from deletion of the miRNA-processing
enzyme Dicer in zebrafish (Giraldez et al., 2005). Lists of axonal

miRNAs have been described in postnatal neurons and recently
in developing cortical neurons (Natera-Naranjo et al., 2010; Sasaki et al., 2013). Some individual miRNAs have been found to
regulate axon growth, and evidence suggesting local action
within axons has come from studies involving microcompartment chambers (Aschrafi et al., 2008; Dajas-Bailador et al., 2012;
Zhang et al., 2013), although local activity has not been directly
shown in severed axon preparations. More generally, the functions and mechanisms of action of miRNAs remain little explored
in axon development.
miR-132 is one of the best characterized miRNAs in the nervous system, and is known for roles in dendrite morphology and
synapse function (Vo et al., 2010; Siegel et al., 2011; Wanet et al.,
2012). Two miR-132 targets that have been studied extensively in
dendrites are the mRNAs for Rho GTPase activator p250GAP,
and transcription factor MeCP2. Since miR-132 is present in the
somatodendritic compartment and at synapses (Kye et al., 2007;
Lugli et al., 2008; Wayman et al., 2008), an interesting possibility
is that it might function locally at synapses, although local action
of miR-132 at a subcellular site has not yet been shown. Notably,
miR-132 is dysregulated in major neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases (Im and Kenny, 2012; Mellios and Sur, 2012; Wanet et al., 2012). Although such findings
have been interpreted in the context of miR-132’s known function in dendrites, these diseases are equally likely to involve defects in the axon. miR-132 regulates extension of cultured
cortical neurites (Vo et al., 2005), which may develop into
either dendrites or axons, but no role of miR-132 in axons has
been described.

Hancock et al. • miR-132 in Axon Development

Here we explore miRNA function in dorsal root ganglion
(DRG) sensory neurons. DRG axon development is shown to
depend on Dicer in vivo, and an unbiased screen identifies a
specific set of miRNAs preferentially localized to the developing
axon. Of these, miR-132 showed high axonal enrichment and
abundance, and its expression correlated with the period of maximum DRG axon elaboration in vivo. miR-132 is shown to be a
positive regulator of axon extension, acting via the mRNA for Ras
GTPase activator Rasa1, in a mechanism that operates locally
within the axon.

Materials and Methods
Animals. Dicerflox/flox (strain B6.Cg-Dicer1tm1Bdh/J) mice were from Cliff
Tabin at Harvard Medical School; Wnt1⫹/Cre (strain STOCK Tg(Wnt1cre)11Rth Tg(Wnt1-GAL4)11Rth/J) mice were from Susan Dymecki at
Harvard Medical School; ROSA26 (R26R) (strain B6.129S4Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1Sor/J) mice were from The Jackson Laboratory; and
wild-type Swiss Webster (strain SW) mice were obtained from Taconic.
Mice of either sex were used in accordance with Harvard Medical School
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocols.
Neuronal cultures. Mouse E13.5 dorsal root ganglia were plated as
explants or dissociated and plated in 8-well poly-D-lysine/laminin chamber slides (BD Biosciences). Cells were cultured in Accell medium (Dharmacon) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 50 ng/ml
nerve growth factor (NGF; Invitrogen). When cultures were maintained
for ⬎24 h, the anti-mitotic FUDR was added 16 –24 h after plating to
avoid glial cell proliferation. Plasmids and miRNA inhibitors or mimics
(Ambion) were introduced before plating using the Neon electroporation system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, dissociated cells were pelleted and rinsed in PBS without Ca 2⫹ or
Mg 2⫹, resuspended in R buffer, and electroporated (1450 V, 20 width, 1
pulse) at a concentration of 10 4 cells/␮l in the presence of 2.5 pmol/␮l
miRNA inhibitor or mimic and 50 ng/␮l pCS2-GFP plasmid. Cellpermeable PNA miRNA inhibitors (PNA Bio) were added directly to the
culture medium (2 ␮M).
Cell and tissue labeling. For whole-mount immunolabeling, hindlimb
buds were processed as described previously (Wickramasinghe et al.,
2008). Whole-mount ␤-galactosidase staining was performed as described previously (Sanes et al., 1986). Immunolabeling was performed
as described previously (Hancock et al., 2011) using the following antibodies: mouse anti-Islet1/2 (1:1000, Developmental Studies Hybridoma
Bank 39.4D5); rabbit anti-peripherin (1:500, Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents); rabbit anti-TrkA (1:1000, L. Reichardt, University of
California, San Francisco); rabbit anti-Argonaute 2 (1:100, Cell Signaling
Technology); mouse anti-Dicer (1:100, Abcam); rabbit anti-GFP (1:2000,
Invitrogen); rabbit anti-NF-M (1:1000, Millipore Bioscience Research
Reagents); mouse anti-Ras GAP (1:400, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); or
rabbit anti-Tuj1 (1:500, Abcam), followed by Alexa fluorophoreconjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, Invitrogen), and mounted with
Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech). As a negative control, cells were immunolabeled with secondary antibody alone to verify an absence of nonspecific background signal caused by secondary antibodies. F-actin was
labeled with Alexa-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen). Sections were
imaged with a Nikon C1 point scanning confocal system equipped with
a TE200 inverted microscope and a CCD camera (ORCA-R2, Hamamatsu).
To count DRG neurons in sections, thoracic-lumbar spinal cords were
matched for position on the rostral-caudal axis from each genotype. Cultured neurons were imaged with a Nikon Ti inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD camera (ORCA-R2, Hamamatsu), using
MetaMorph image analysis software (Molecular Devices, Version 7.7.9).
Microfluidic chambers. Mouse E13.5 DRG explants were aspirated into
the “cell body” compartment of AXIS microfluidic devices (Millipore).
After 3 d, axons extended through the ⱖ150 ␮m microgrooves to the
“axon” compartment. A larger volume of medium was added to the axon
compartment to prevent the backflow of cell body contaminants into the
axon compartment. To isolate axonal or total neuron RNA, RNA lysis
buffer was added to either the cell body or the axon compartment, and
total RNA was extracted using mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion).

Quantitative real-time PCR. Rodent Taqman low density (TLDA) MicroRNA A Arrays (v2.0; Applied Biosystems) were used to assess miRNA
expression profiles. For each sample, 30 ng of total RNA was used. For
each condition, at least three samples from two independent experiments
were processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using an
Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System at the Biopolymers Facility in the Genetics Department at Harvard Medical School.
Only miRNAs with a CT ⱕ 35 were included in the analysis, since a CT ⬎
35 is reported to be below the reliable detection level for mature miRNA
(Chen et al., 2009). For the comparison of Dicer (⫹/⫹) versus Dicer
(⫺/⫺) samples, miRNAs were analyzed by the comparative CT method,
normalizing to the endogenous housekeeping gene U6, so that ⌬CT for
each miRNA is given by CT,miRNA ⫺ CT,U6 (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008;
Natera-Naranjo et al., 2010). To compare data from axonal versus total
neuron preparations, the RQ for each miRNA was calculated as 2 ⫺⌬⌬CT ,
where ⌬⌬CT ⫽ ⌬CT,axon ⫺ ⌬CT,cell. For the axon versus total neuron
measurements, we used two different methods for normalization. One
approach was to normalize by the average value for all detected miRNA
in the sample, so that for each miRNA, ⌬CT,axon ⫽ CT,axon ⫺ CT,axon ave;
and ⌬CT,cell ⫽ CT,cell ⫺ CT,cell ave. The second method was an approach
used previously (Natera-Naranjo et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2013), in
which each miRNA was normalized to U6 snRNA, on the assumption
that U6 is distributed equally in the axon and soma. Both of these normalization procedures revealed enrichment of miR-132 and other miRNAs in the axon, although the U6 procedure produced axonal
enrichment values that were ⬃4- to 15-fold higher. The heat map in
Figure 2D (see below) is based on the more conservative normalization
approach using average miRNA distribution. Normalized values for replicates were averaged, and heat maps were generated by heatmap.2 in the
gplots package of R/Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004).
For quantitation of individual miRNAs, 5–10 ng of total RNA was
reverse transcribed with specific primers (miR-132, miR-125a-5p, and
snoRNA202) from TaqMan MicroRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems).
For precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) or mature miRNA analysis in parallel with mRNA analysis, 30 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed
using specific primers (pre-miR-132, miR-132, miR-125a-5p, and
snoRNA61; Qiagen) and miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen). miR-125a-5p levels were used for normalization in quantitative reverse transcription
(qRT)-PCRs for individual miRNAs, since our qRT-PCR TLDA results
(using the average miRNA normalization method) revealed that miR125a-5p was approximately equally expressed in the axon and total cell.
For mRNA analysis, 30 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using
Superscript III (Invitrogen). One tenth of each sample was used for
qRT-PCRs, which consisted of SYBR Green PCR mix (Applied Biosystems) and a primer pair. For each condition, at least three experimental samples were used for qRT-PCR, and each sample was run in
triplicate. qRT-PCR was performed using an ABI Biosystems 7900HT
Sequence Detection System, and data were analyzed by the comparative Ct method (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008). The following primer
pairs were used: ␤-actin (NM_007393; RTPrimerDB ID 2847; Pattyn et
al., 2003): 5⬘-CAACGAGCGGTTCCGATG-3⬘ and 5⬘-GCCACAGGATTCCATACCCA-3⬘; ␥-actin (NM_009609; PrimerBank ID
6752954a1; Wang and Seed, 2003): 5⬘-AATCGCCGCACTCGTCATT-3⬘
and 5⬘-CCCTACGATGGAAGGGAACAC-3⬘; Crk1 (NM_133656;
PrimerBank ID 31559995a3): 5⬘-GGAGGTCGGTGAGCTGGTA-3⬘ and
5⬘-TCCTCATCGGGATTCTGTTGAT-3⬘; Gapdh (NM_008084; PrimerBank ID 6679937a1): 5⬘-AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG-3⬘ and 5⬘TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA-3⬘; and Rasa1 (NM_145452;
PrimerBank ID 164663772b3): 5⬘-TTATGATGGGAGGCCGCTATT-3⬘
and 5⬘-CTGCATTGGTACAGGTTCCTT-3⬘.
miRNA in situ hybridization. In situ hybridizations were performed as
described previously (Lu and Tsourkas, 2011) with fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated miRNA LNA probes (10 nM, Exiqon). A scrambled
miRNA LNA probe was used as a negative control. After a series of
posthybridization washes, the LNA signal was amplified using the Tyramide Signal Amplification PLUS Fluorescein Kit (PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Neurons were imaged with a
Nikon Ti inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD
camera (ORCA-R2, Hamamatsu) using MetaMorph software (Molecu-

lar Devices, Version 7.7.9). Outlines of axons were traced using MetaMorph by increasing brightness to make autofluorescence visible
throughout the cell. Average fluorescence intensity (AFI) was measured
using the Region Measurement function in MetaMorph. Background
intensities were measured in regions of the coverslip devoid of cells and
were subtracted from measurements.
Target site protectors. A miRCURY LNA Power Target Site Block oligonucleotide (target site protector, TP) was custom designed complementary to the sequence containing the predicted miR-132 binding site
(470 – 476 nt: GACUGUU) within mouse Rasa1 3⬘UTR (Rasa1-TP:
AGTGAACAGTCAAATGGTCAT). A scrambled TP was used as a negative control (con-TP: GTGTAACACGTCTATACGCCCA). TPs were
from Exiqon and were used at 50 nM.
Quantitation of axonal extension. Quantitation of DRG axon extension
was performed by tracing axons using MetaMorph. For DRG explants,
⬎20 axons per explant were measured. For differential interference contrast (DIC) time-lapse microscopy, DRG explants were cultured overnight and then placed on a motorized stage enclosed by a CO2 incubation
chamber at 37°C (Solent Scientific). Growth cones were randomly selected, and time-lapse images were acquired using DIC optics on a Nikon
TE2000 microscope equipped with a CCD camera (ORCA-R2,
Hamamatsu). Images were captured every 30 s for 1 h and axon extension
rates were measured using MetaMorph. For Neuro2A cell analysis, cells
were cotransfected with pCS2-GFP plasmid and scrambled control or
Rasa1 siRNA (20 nM, Ambion), miRNA mimic (25 nM, Ambion), or
pAPtag-5-Rasa1-Myc (Rasa1-⌬3⬘UTR, provided by T. Yamashita, Osaka
University, Osaka, Japan; Endo and Yamashita, 2009) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For target site protector experiments,
Neuro2A cells were cotransfected with pCS2-GFP plasmid, con-TP or
Rasa1-TP (50 nM, Exiqon), and miRNA mimic (25 nM, Ambion). After
24 h, Neuro2A cells were serum starved in the presence of dibutyryl
cAMP (2 mM, Sigma) for an additional 24 h to induce differentiation.
Neurons were imaged with a Nikon Ti motorized inverted microscope with Perfect Focus System equipped with a 20⫻ objective lens
and a CCD camera (ORCA-R2, Hamamatsu). At least 300 GFP⫹
axons were quantitated per condition. Axon length was traced and
measured using MetaMorph.
Treatment of severed axons. For acute treatment of severed axons,
mouse E13.5 DRG explants were cultured for 2 d, and axons were severed
from explants using a fine scalpel blade. Cultures were treated with antisense PNA oligonucleotides (2 ␮M) in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (10 ␮g/ml, Sigma) for 3.5 h, fixed, and processed for
immunolabeling. Images were captured, and fluorescence intensities
were measured by selecting a region of interest (ROI) for axons based on
the Tuj1 labeling using the auto-trace function of MetaMorph (Version
7.7.9, Molecular Devices). The axon ROIs were then superimposed onto
the Rasa1 image and the AFI was measured using the Region Measurement function in MetaMorph. Background intensities were measured in
regions of the coverslip devoid of cells and were subtracted from axon
measurements.
Luciferase assay. Rasa1 3⬘UTR was PCR-amplified from mouse
genomic DNA using primers 5⬘-GAGAGAGCTCCAGCCTGTGTTCTGCGT-3⬘ and 5⬘-GAGATCTAGAATAGACCTTGATTACT-3⬘. The
PCR product was digested with SacI and XbaI and cloned into pmiRGlo
vector (Promega) downstream of the luc2 reporter gene. Neuro2A cells
were plated on 24-well plates and cotransfected with the reporter and
scrambled control or miRNA inhibitor (Ambion) using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed 1 d later, and firefly and Renilla luciferases were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) with an Envision Luminometer (PerkinElmer). Activity
was reported by normalizing firefly to Renilla luciferase activity.
Statistics. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed t test
or ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD post hoc test (GraphPad Prism, Version
4.0c).

Results
Dicer is essential for normal DRG axon development in vivo
DRG sensory neurons have long been a major model for axon
development. The DRG neuron extends a bifurcated axon, and

Hancock et al. • miR-132 in Axon Development

receives input from cutaneous and muscle targets through a peripheral axon branch, rather than from dendrites, while output to
the spinal cord is sent through a central axon branch. To initially
explore potential functions of miRNAs in developing DRG axons, we used a conditional null allele of Dicer (Harfe et al., 2005)
to inactivate the processing of small RNAs. Since deletion of Dicer in mice results in embryonic lethality at the blastocyst stage,
conditional Dicerflox/flox mice were crossed with a line in which
Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the Wnt1 promoter (Danielian et al., 1998). Wnt1 expression commences at
E9.5 in neural crest-derived cells (Echelard et al., 1994), and Dicerflox/flox;Wnt1⫹/Cre mice survive until birth (Zehir et al., 2010).
To track Cre-expressing cells, we used the ROSA26 reporter
(R26R) transgene, which exhibits constitutive ␤-gal expression
when activated by Cre (Soriano, 1999). In Dicerflox/flox;Wnt1⫹/Cre;
R26R⫹/ ⫺ embryos at E13.5, Cre expression was confirmed to be
prominent in DRG neurons (data not shown) and axons (Fig.
1A). In Dicer conditional knock-outs, we observed aberrant sensory axon trajectories in peripheral targets as early as E12.5, and a
62% reduction in peripheral innervation at E13.5 (Fig. 1A–E).
The axon defects were detected at a stage before DRG neuron loss,
indicating that the defects were not secondary to neuronal death
(Fig. 1 F, G). DRG explants from E13.5 mutants survived in vitro
in the presence of NGF, but showed a reduction in axon length
(473.76 ⫾ 16.47 vs 288.72 ⫾ 12.17 ␮m; Fig. 1 H, I ) and reduced
extension rate (1.16 ⫾ 0.21 vs 0.57 ⫾ 0.14 ␮m/min; Fig. 1J ).
Thus, the miRNA processing enzyme Dicer is essential for normal sensory axon development in vivo, and axon extension in
vitro.
Identification of miRNAs preferentially localized in
DRG axons
Having observed axon defects in the Dicer mutants, we were
interested to identify candidate miRNAs that might account for
such effects. We reasoned that miRNAs that are important for
axon development might be present within the axon compartment. Moreover, we were interested in the possibility that, if there
were miRNAs specialized for a function in the axon, then those
miRNAs might be preferentially enriched in the axon relative to
the cell body. Consistent with a local miRNA function in DRG
axons, proteins involved in miRNA biogenesis and activity, Ago2
and Dicer, were found to be present (Fig. 2A). To study events
specifically within the axonal compartment, DRG explants from
E13.5 embryos were cultured in multicompartment microfluidic
chambers (Fig. 2B), which can be used to harvest isolated axons
(Willis and Twiss, 2011). As a control, the purity of the axonal
RNA samples was tested by qRT-PCR, confirming that axonal
samples were enriched in ␤-actin mRNA and essentially devoid of
␥-actin mRNA, which is present exclusively in the soma (Fig. 2C).
After 3 d in culture, RNA was extracted from both the total neuron compartment and the axon compartment, and the quantitative expression profile of 375 mature miRNAs was measured
using qRT-PCR rodent TLDAs. In the analysis shown in Figure
2D, axonal distributions were normalized relative to the entire
population of miRNAs, rather than normalizing to an individual
RNA, which might potentially have a distinctive distribution itself (see Materials and Methods for details). The results showed
differential enrichment of miRNAs in the axons compared with
whole neurons: of 61 miRNAs detected in axons, 26 miRNAs
showed ⬎1.5-fold enrichment in axons, whereas five showed depletion in axons (Fig. 2D). We only considered miRNAs with
average CT (threshold cycle) values lower than 35, since a mature
miRNA CT ⬎35 is reported to be below the reliable detection

limit (Chen et al., 2009). The axonal miRNAs were also ranked in
order of abundance in axons (Fig. 2E; Table 1). Of the top 20 most
abundant axonal miRNAs, only 11 were ⬎1.5-fold enriched in
axons, indicating that enrichment is not a simple reflection of
abundance.
We next asked whether any of the axonally expressed miRNAs
might be candidates to account for axon defects seen in the Dicer
mutants at the early stage of E12.5, when axon defects were first
detected in vivo (Fig. 1A). To do this, we compared miRNA TLDA
profiles of DRG from E12.5 Dicerflox/flox;Wnt1⫹/Cre and Dicer⫹/⫹;
Wnt1⫹/Cre embryos. The results identified 212 miRNAs in E12.5
DRGs, of which 67 showed ⬎50% decreased expression in the
Dicer mutants (Fig. 3A). It is worth noting that miRNAs are
generally stable (Davis et al., 2008; Mitchell et al., 2008), which
presumably explains why there was not a complete loss of all
miRNAs in the DRGs at this early stage, 3 d after Wnt1 expression
commences (Echelard et al., 1994). We next looked for overlap
between the set of miRNAs that were ⬎50% reduced in the Dicer
mutant DRGs and those that were ⬎1.5-fold enriched in axons
(Fig. 3B). Four miRNAs met these criteria (miR-132, miR-155,
miR-365, and miR-410), and of these four, miR-132 was by far
the most abundant in axons (Fig. 2E; Table 1). In accordance with
the TLDA findings, qRT-PCR confirmed that miR-132 was reduced by 80% in the Dicerflox/flox;Wnt1⫹/Cre DRG at E12.5 (Fig.
3C), and that miR-132 was enriched by 13-fold in axons relative
to its level in the neuron (1.00 ⫾ 0.01 vs 13.03 ⫾ 3.44; Fig. 3D).
Using qRT-PCR, we also detected pre-miR-132 in DRG axons,
and its expression was enriched by 45-fold in axons relative to
whole neurons (1.00 ⫾ 0.06 vs 45.10 ⫾ 7.86; Fig. 3 E, F ). To
further verify the presence of miR-132 in axons and visualize its
distribution, fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed
using a specific LNA probe, which showed labeling in axons,
especially in growth cones (Fig. 3G,H ).
miR-132 as a regulator of axon extension
We next looked at the temporal expression profile of miR-132 in
DRG development, to see whether its expression might correlate
with the period of DRG axon growth in vivo. miR-132 expression
progressively increased from E12.5 to E17.5 (2.7-fold increase
from 1.00 ⫾ 0.17 to 2.65 ⫾ 0.39; Fig. 4A), the developmental

period when DRG axons rapidly increase their expansion into
central and peripheral targets (Mirnics and Koerber, 1995a,b;
Ozaki and Snider, 1997), and later decreased by P21, a period
when DRG axons are no longer growing. As a negative control, no
difference was detected in miR-125a-5p expression (Fig. 4B). We
were next interested to functionally evaluate the role of miR-132
in axon growth. Previous studies have shown that miR-132 promotes extension of cultured cortical neurites (Vo et al., 2005),
which may develop into either dendrites or axons, as well as
neurites of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (Lin et al., 2012).
Here, we first performed a loss-of-function analysis using antisense inhibitors in cultured primary DRG neurons. In addition to
miR-132, this analysis included other axonally enriched miRNAs
(data not shown), but only miR-132 inhibition affected axon
extension (reduced from 202.68 ⫾ 7.02 to 159.98 ⫾ 8.57 ␮m; Fig.
4C,D). This reduction was strikingly similar to the effect of Dicer
gene deletion in the same assay (Fig. 4C,D; compare miR-132
inhibitor versus Dicer ⫺ / ⫺; 159.98 ⫾ 8.57 vs 164.29 ⫾ 16.73 ␮m),
indicating that miR-132 could account, at least in part, for the
Dicer effect on axon extension, although other miRNAs may contribute also. Conversely, miR-132 gain-of-function using a
miRNA mimic resulted in increased DRG axon extension (37%
increase from 202.68 ⫾ 7.02 to 277.60 ⫾ 13.04 ␮m; Fig. 4C,D).
We were not able to test rescue of the axon defect in the Dicer
mutant neurons using the miR-132 mimic, because the Dicer
mutant neurons were not able to survive electroporation. Nonetheless, together, these results indicate that miR-132 regulates
axon extension in DRG neurons and suggest that it could account
for a substantial proportion of the effect of Dicer deficiency.
Rasa1 mRNA as a miR-132 target in DRG neurons
To gain more insight into the mechanism of the effect of miR132, we combined computational and experimental results to
identify relevant mRNA target(s) in the axon. We first used the
TargetScan program, which predicts and ranks miRNA:target
matches based on conservation, number, type, and position of
3⬘UTR binding sites (Lewis et al., 2005). This analysis identified 314 targets predicted to be responsive to miR-132 and
conserved among species (Fig. 5A). We compared this list to a
previously published list of mRNAs repressed by the overexpression of miR-132 in HeLa cells [Grimson et al., 2007; data at NCBI
GEO database (Edgar et al., 2002), accession number GSE8501].
Additionally, we asked which of the putative target mRNAs are
present in embryonic axons. Of the 1800 axonal mRNAs previously identified by laser-capture microdissection in embryonic
axons (Zivraj et al., 2010), the mRNA for p120RasGAP (Rasa1), a
protein that inactivates Ras by stimulating GTP hydrolysis, also
met our criteria as a predicted miR-132 target conserved among
species and reduced in cells overexpressing miR-132 (Fig. 5A). It
is worth noting that although p250GAP and MeCP2 mRNAs have
been studied as miR-132 targets in synapse biology (Wanet et al.,
2012), these mRNAs show little or no detectable expression in
developing axons (Zivraj et al., 2010; Gumy et al., 2011; data not
shown). Using qRT-PCR, we confirmed the presence of Rasa1
mRNA in isolated DRG axons (Fig. 5B). In contrast, Crk1 mRNA,
a miR-132 target that was previously not detected in axons (Zivraj
et al., 2010; Gumy et al., 2011; Cambronne et al., 2012), provided
a negative control. Using qRT-PCR, we found that Rasa1 mRNA expression was increased in E12.5 DRGs from Dicerflox/floxWnt1⫹/Cre
embryos compared with control littermates (Fig. 5C), a finding
reciprocal with the decreased miR-132 expression in these mutants (Fig. 3C). Although it is likely that additional mRNAs might
also mediate effects of miR-132, Rasa1 mRNA is particularly ap-

cells and found that miR-132 inhibition
resulted in increased expression of the luciferase reporter, whereas inhibition of
miR-150, as a control, showed no effect
(Fig. 5F ). Furthermore, overexpression of
a miR-132 mimic decreased endogenous
Rasa1 mRNA expression, confirming
Rasa1 mRNA as a target of miR-132 in
neurons (Fig. 5G). Since the miR-132
mimic is expected to interact with all
mRNA targets of miR-132, we next used
the target protector approach, which involves an antisense oligonucleotide designed to block the miRNA binding site
on a specific mRNA target of interest and
not on other target mRNAs (Choi et al.,
2007). This approach can provide a test of
whether the mimic is acting on the target
of interest directly. Accordingly, we designed a TP specific to the miR-132 site in
the Rasa1 3⬘UTR (Rasa1-TP). As predicted, Rasa1-TP, compared with control
TP, promoted rescue of the effect of miR132 mimic on Rasa1 mRNA level (Fig.
5H ), whereas Rasa1-TP did not affect the
level of Crk1 mRNA, another miR-132
target (Cambronne et al., 2012), which
was regulated by the mimic, providing a
control for specificity (Fig. 5H ). Together,
these results support a direct regulatory
effect of miR-132 on Rasa1 mRNA.
Rasa1 mRNA showed a progressive developmental decrease in DRGs from
E13.5 to E17.5 (1.00 ⫾ 0.05 vs 0.59 ⫾ 0.04;
Fig. 5I ), as miR-132 was increasing (Fig.
4A), consistent with the loss- and gain-offunction experiments showing that miR132 represses Rasa1 mRNA in developing
DRG neurons. We next tested whether altering Rasa1 expression had an effect on

target site protector approach. Expression of miR-132 mimic in
the presence of a control TP resulted in increased axon extension,
whereas the Rasa1-TP prevented the miR-132 mimic-induced
increase in axon extension (Fig. 5L). Together these data support
a model in which the function of miR-132 in axon extension is
mediated, at least in part, through its regulation of Rasa1
expression.

Local activity of miR-132 in the axon
The presence of both miR-132 and Rasa1 mRNA in axons suggested a model in which miR-132 might be capable of regulating
translation locally within the axon. An advantage of the axon as
an experimental system to study subcellularly localized events is
that axons can survive being severed from the cell body, providing a direct test for processes occurring within the axon. Here, we

compared the effect of miR-132 inhibition in intact and severed
DRG axons, using the expression of Rasa1 as a functional readout. Preliminary experiments showed that Rasa1 protein is expressed in DRG axons, including the growth cone (Fig. 6A).
Knockdown of miR-132 was accomplished by using a miR-132

PNA inhibitor, which we confirmed by qRT-PCR to reduce miR132 expression by 55% within 3.5 h in axons (Fig. 6B). In intact
DRG axons, miR-132 inhibition resulted in a 27% increase in
Rasa1 expression within 3.5 h (1.00 ⫾ 0.07 vs 1.27 ⫾ 0.07; Fig.
6 D, E). To rule out the possibility that increased axonal Rasa1

76 • J. Neurosci., January 1, 2014 • 34(1):66 –78

protein was due to anterograde transport from cell bodies, axons
were severed before treatment with the miR-132 PNA inhibitor
(Fig. 6C). In severed axons, inhibition of miR-132 resulted in an
18% increase in Rasa1 within 3.5 h (1.00 ⫾ 0.02 vs 1.18 ⫾ 0.02;
Fig. 6 D, E). It may be worth noting that these results most likely
underrepresent the effect of local miR-132 activity in the axon,
since knockdown of miR-132 with the PNA inhibitor was not
complete within 3.5 h (Fig. 6B), and since Rasa1 turnover may
not reach steady state within 3.5 h; this may also explain why the
effect is quantitatively smaller than that seen using the PNA inhibitor in DRG cultures over a longer period of 2 d (Fig. 5D). The
increase in Rasa1 protein level was confirmed to be dependent on
local protein synthesis, since it was prevented by exposure to the
translation inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 6 D, E). The effect on
Rasa1 protein was specific, as the level of ␤3-tubulin was not
affected (Fig. 6F ). In contrast to the increase in Rasa1 protein, we
did not detect an increase in Rasa1 mRNA in response to miR132 inhibition (Fig. 6G), suggesting that miR-132 regulates Rasa1
synthesis primarily through an effect on translational efficiency
in DRG axons. Together, the results show that miR-132 targets
Rasa1 mRNA locally within the axon.

Discussion
Mechanisms of axon development are fundamental to establishing a functional neural circuitry. Although many studies have
shown that developing axons translate mRNAs, and that this can
play roles in axon growth and guidance (Hengst and Jaffrey, 2007;
Jung et al., 2012), the mechanisms underlying RNA-based regulation within the axon are not well understood. miRNAs are well
established as key translational regulators in other systems, although their functions and mechanisms of action have still been
little explored in developing axons. Here we show functions of
miRNAs in developing DRG axons, identify a specific set of miRNAs in the developing axon, and show that miR-132 is a positive
regulator of axon extension that is selectively enriched in the axon
and can act there locally.
Initially, to understand the role of miRNAs during DRG sensory axon development, we generated a Dicer conditional knockout mouse model and observed peripheral sensory axon defects
as early as E12.5, a stage when DRG axons are initially extending
(Mirnics and Koerber, 1995a,b; Ozaki and Snider, 1997). These
results showing a requirement of Dicer for normal DRG axon
pathfinding appear broadly consistent with reports that Dicer
depletion also affects development of hindbrain longitudinal
tracts, and olfactory and retinal axons (Giraldez et al., 2005; Berdnik et al., 2008; Choi et al., 2008; Pinter and Hindges, 2010). At
this early stage of development, we did not observe a reduction in
DRG size or neuron number, although neuron survival was decreased at a later stage, in agreement with a previous report that
miRNA function is required for survival at later stages but not for
proliferation or differentiation of DRG neuron precursors (Zehir
et al., 2010). It is worth noting that although Dicer is also required
for processing of dsRNA transcripts into siRNA, Dicer phenotypes identified in previous studies have been attributable to
miRNAs (Fineberg et al., 2009); thus, although potential effects
on other small RNAs cannot be excluded, our Dicer results are
most likely explained by a role for miRNAs in determining the
development of DRG axons.
To perform a large-scale survey of miRNAs in developing
axons, we used qRT-PCR TLDAs for an unbiased screen. Our list
of miRNAs in developing DRG axons showed little overlap with a
set of miRNAs detected in the axons of postnatal rat superior
cervical ganglion neurons (Natera-Naranjo et al., 2010), or a re-

cently published list of miRNAs enriched in developing cortical
axons (Sasaki et al., 2013), perhaps due to the different neuron
type (DRG vs superior cervical ganglion or cortical neurons),
methodologies used, or stage (embryonic or postnatal). Indeed,
since distinct repertoires of axonal mRNAs are found in axons
from different cell types or developmental stages (Zivraj et al.,
2010; Gumy et al., 2011), it seems plausible that the repertoire of
miRNAs would also differ. From our list of DRG axon miRNAs,
we selected miR-132 to study further since it was abundant in the
developing axon and, moreover, was strongly enriched in the
axon relative to the whole neuron. Whereas our study shows
preferential localization of miR-132 in the axon versus the soma
of DRG neurons from midgestation embryos, other studies have
found that miR-132 is present in the somatodendritic compartment of late embryonic or postnatal neurons, or in synaptic fractions of adult brain (Kye et al., 2007; Lugli et al., 2008; Wayman et
al., 2008). It is important to emphasize that these studies appear
entirely consistent with our results, especially considering that
the subcellular distribution could depend on the stage of neuronal maturation, or it might differ between neuron types. In this
context, it is worth noting that the DRG neurons studied here
lack dendrites, as their input instead comes from the peripheral
branch of the axon. It is interesting that in addition to the mature
form, the precursor form, pre-miR-132, was also enriched in the
axon, and Dicer was present in DRG axons, suggesting that local
biogenesis of mature miR-132 might occur in the axon. In this
regard, our findings appear consistent with a previous report that
pre-miRNAs and Dicer are present in synaptic fractions (Lugli et
al., 2008) and suggest that local biogenesis may occur on a subcellular level in axons or dendrites. Regarding the functional output of miR-132, it is of interest to compare the enhancement of
synaptodendritic growth or function seen in several studies (for
review, see Vo et al., 2010; Wanet et al., 2012) with the promotion
of axonal extension that we observed here, suggesting a general
model in which miR-132 functions to promote growth of peripheral cellular structures even though the specific downstream
mRNA targets may differ.
Turning to the question of what downstream targets mediate
the effect of miR-132 in the axon, although the mRNAs for the
Rho-GTPase activator p250GAP and the transcription factor
MeCP2 have been extensively characterized as miR-132 targets in
dendrites and in synapse biology (Vo et al., 2010; Wanet et al.,
2012), these mRNAs showed little or no detectable expression in
developing axons (Zivraj et al., 2010; Gumy et al., 2011; data not
shown). We provide several complementary lines of evidence
that the mRNA for the Ras-GTPase activator Rasa1 is a functionally significant target of miR-132 in neurons. These results appear
consistent with studies showing regulation of Rasa1 mRNA by
miR-132 in epithelial and HEK 293 cells (Anand et al., 2010;
Cambronne et al., 2012). Rasa1 is known to be involved in cytoskeletal regulation (Holland et al., 1997; Elowe et al., 2001; Dail et
al., 2006; Endo and Yamashita, 2009). Moreover, Rasa1 mRNA is
expressed highly in DRGs (Allen Institute for Brain Science,
http://mousespinal.brain-map.org), although a function in sensory axons was not previously described. Although it is likely that
miR-132 may act via additional mRNA targets, our data indicate
that Rasa1 mRNA is a downstream target of miR-132 that regulates axon extension in developing DRG neurons.
Regarding regulation of miR-132 activity, we considered two
general possibilities: (1) miR-132 activity might potentially be
regulated by axon guidance cues, and (2) temporal regulation of
miR-132 might correlate with developmental stage. In searching
for signaling cues that might be upstream of miR-132, we were

Hancock et al. • miR-132 in Axon Development

not able to detect changes in miR-132 activity upon adding the
guidance cues ephrin-B1, Sema3A, or NGF (data not shown),
although we cannot exclude possible regulation by other cues or
in different conditions. On the other hand, our data showing that
miR-132 expression showed a progressive temporal increase during the period when DRG axons undergo rapid elaboration (Mirnics and Koerber, 1995a,b; Ozaki and Snider, 1997) lead to a
model in which miR-132 expression may be regulated intrinsically to provide a developmental timer. Such a role seems broadly
consistent with other studies identifying functions of miRNAs as
timers, including the initial identification of miRNAs as heterochronic genes in Caenorhabditis elegans development (Ambros,
2011), as well as recent studies identifying miRNA timers of retinal neurogenesis (La Torre et al., 2013), miR-124 as an intrinsic
timer in Xenopus retinal axons (Baudet et al., 2011), and let-7 as a
timer that regulates axon regenerative capacity in C. elegans (Zou
et al., 2013).
miRNAs can regulate mRNA targets by one of two general
mechanisms: translational repression or mRNA degradation, and
typically, miRNAs act by both these mechanisms (Baek et al.,
2008; Bartel, 2009). Although we found that miR-132 inhibition
increased Rasa1 protein in the whole cell and in axons, and increased Rasa1 mRNA levels in the whole cell, we did not detect a
local effect of miR-132 inhibition on Rasa1 mRNA stability in
axons, suggesting that miR-132 may regulate protein synthesis
primarily through an effect on translational efficiency rather than
mRNA degradation in DRG axons. Interestingly, these results
provide experimental support for a model in which it was hypothesized that translational repression might turn out to be preferred over mRNA degradation in the axon (Vo et al., 2010). Such
a mechanism could be favorable since it may otherwise be inefficient or counterproductive to degrade localized mRNAs, which
have been transported over long distances into the axon.
Regulated mRNA translation has increasingly emerged in recent years as an important mechanism in biology and disease.
Here we set out to explore potential functions of miRNAs in
regulating translation in developing DRG axons. Our results
show that miRNAs are essential for proper DRG axon development in vivo, and identify a set of miRNAs preferentially localized
to the developing axon. Of these, miR-132 was notable for showing both high abundance and high enrichment in the axon, and
further studies identified it as a regulator of axon extension, acting through regulation of its target Rasa1 mRNA, in a mechanism
that operates locally within the axon. In previous studies, miR132 has been notable for its dysregulation in major neurologic
diseases, including autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar and depressive disorders, drug addiction, and Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s diseases (Im and Kenny, 2012; McNeill and
Van Vactor, 2012; Mellios and Sur, 2012; Wanet et al., 2012). The
identification of miR-132 here as a regulator in the axon opens
the possibility of further studies into its axonal roles both in the
establishment of normal neuronal circuitry and in disease.
