Recent reports of microRNA (miR) modulators of both
neuronal and immune processes (here termed NeurimmiRs) predict therapeutic potential for manipulating
NeurimmiR levels in diseases affecting both the immune
system and higher brain functions, such as Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis
(MS) and anxiety-related disorders. In our opinion, NeurimmiRs that function within both the nervous and the
immune systems, such as miR-132 and miR-124, may act
as ‘negotiators’ between these two interacting compartments. We suggest that NeurimmiRs primarily target
transcriptional or other regulatory genes, which enables
modulation of both immune and cognitive processes
through direct or indirect alterations of neuron–glia
and/or brain-to-body signaling. Thus, manipulating
NeurimmiR control over the immune contributions to
cognitive pathways may offer new therapeutic targets.

MicroRNAs can modulate both neuronal and immune
functions
MicroRNAs (miRs) are increasingly appreciated as being
involved in all aspects of cellular functioning in a wide
range of eukaryotic organisms [1]. However, although most
miRs have multiple predicted targets, the majority of
current miR studies focus on experimental validation of
only one target. To the best of our knowledge, no hierarchy
of miR–target interactions has yet been published for any
miR. Furthermore, numerous mRNAs carry multiple putative binding sites for many miRs, but the experimental
validation of miR–target relationships is rather laborious.
Therefore, most studies have validated only one of those
miRs experimentally. Also, whether or not any of those
miR–target interactions override the others, and the underlying principles for such putative competition, remain
unknown (Box 1).
The brain modulates immune functions using neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and hormones, senses peripheral inflammation by detecting inflammatory agents (such
as proinflammatory cytokines and other immune regulators), and can potentiate or counteract inflammation in a
‘top-down’ effect [2]. Reciprocally, the immune system can

affect the brain in a ‘bottom-up’ manner, and converging
lines of evidence highlight the role of neuroinflammation in
both psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases [3]. Of
particular interest are microglia, myeloid cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage that reside within the central
nervous system (CNS) and thus are prime candidates for
mediating communication between the two systems (Box
2). Furthermore, ‘classic’ immune proteins, such as MHC
class I and complement factors, are considered to play new
roles within the nervous system [4], suggesting that these
interacting compartments might also share common miRs.
In the mammalian immune system, miRs control differentiation as well as innate and adaptive immune responses
[5]. In the central nervous system, miRs are involved in
diverse functions, including neuronal development, plasticity and physiological reactions [6]. A subset of these
miRs, here designated NeurimmiRs, notably affects both
immune and neuronal functions. Given that the validation
of many miR targets is far from complete, appreciating the
full neuroimmune impact of NeurimmiRs is in its infancy.
Nevertheless, outlining the existence and assessing the
scope of NeurimmiRs involved in neuroinflammatory processes can assist in evaluating the therapeutic potential of
manipulating their levels in ‘classic’ neuroimmune disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric syndromes. Below, we suggest several putative candidates
for this new class of miRs and focus on one of them,
miR-132, as an exemplar NeurimmiR with far-reaching
implications.
We suggest that the co-occurrence of NeurimmiRs in the
brain and peripheral organs has a function in the crosstalk
between these two compartments, both locally (i.e. brain
inflammation) or in a broad context (regulation of inflammation via the autonomous nervous system). Many miRs
have a broad affect within a certain tissue owing to their
regulation of transcription factors and other regulatory
elements. Therefore, various scenarios might exist in which
the expression of a miRNA ‘shared’ by two tissues is altered.
This in turn might alter gene expression in either one or both
of these compartments. Correspondingly, impaired miR
levels were found in many nervous system diseases [7].
Also, miRs are involved in hematopoiesis [5] and in the
immune components of diverse neural diseases such as
epilepsy or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [8,9]. We also propose
that immune insults change the levels of NeurimmiRs.
Owing to the regulatory roles of these miRs, such changes
often alter inflammation-responsive transcripts within the
brain [e.g. multiple sclerosis (MS)] [10], or in peripheral

Box 1. The biogenesis and functions of miRs
MiRs are short non-protein-coding RNAs with both conserved and
species-specific members. MiRs regulate transcription, mRNA stability and translation and are critical for the expression and epigenetic
control of at least one-half to two-thirds of all known genes and
biochemical pathways [34]. miR precursors (stem-and-loop molecules
generated from a primary transcript) are cleaved to mature 22-base
pair double-stranded molecules, with one strand usually guiding the
complex to a partially complementary sequence often found in the 30 untranslated region (30 -UTR) of target genes. The miR 50 -end ‘seed’
region determines target specificity and dictates mRNA degradation
and translational repression, whereas mRNA cleavage is dependent
on perfect complementary base-pairing at positions 10/11 as well as
on target sites located at the center of the miR [56]. Classically, every
miR can bind to its mRNA targets by incomplete base pairing, with
only the short, approximately seven nucleotides long ‘seed’ region
displaying full complementation; therefore, each miR can potentially
target hundreds of transcripts and achieve network-level regulation of
gene expression [61]. MiR regulation takes place post-transcription-

ally, and is thought to perform rapid fine-tuning rather than total
silencing or induction of targets (‘on’ and ‘off’ switching). Furthermore, repeated binding motifs enable one miR to target several
mRNAs involved in a particular pathway and achieve gene-networklevel regulation. Although a particular miR often affects only a few
targets in specific cell types, the potential multiplicity of gene
targeting makes assessing and proving that a specific gene or
pathway is indeed a target of a particular miR an elusive and
nontrivial task. A major disadvantage in miR research is the difficulty
in validating putative target mRNAs identified for a specific miR; a
variety of online algorithms that utilize different approaches to predict
miR–mRNA interactions exist, but the predicted targets for each miR
might be dissimilar and largely non-overlapping and often exclude
many experimentally proven and validated targets. Thus, current
bioinformatics tools, as well as the understanding of miR biology
itself, are still in their infancy. In many cases, a target-based search for
complementary miRs [35] might be more useful than a miR screen for
targets.

leukocytes. In the periphery, this would alter complement
factors, adhesion molecules, reactive oxygen species and
proinflammatory cytokines, facilitate crossing of the
blood–brain-barrier (BBB) and influence a broad spectrum
of neuronal processes such as neurotransmission, synapse
morphology and cognition [11].

potentiation (LTP) in sensory-motor neurons [14] and is
involved in regulating hippocampal-induced plasticity under chronic cocaine intake [15]. In the hematopoietic compartment, miR-124 is exclusively expressed in microglia
and CNS macrophages where it supposedly targets the
transcription factor C/EBP-a and therefore also its downstream gene, the myeloid cell-associated transcription factor Pu.1. A recent study reports a miR-124-mediated
microglial phenotype switch from an inflammatory
(CD45hiMHCII+) to a quiescent state (CD45loMHCII–).
This successfully inhibits the onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a rodent model of MS
[16]. Furthermore, miR-124 targets glucocorticoid receptors, an important component of stress responses and thus
might contribute to controlling stress disorders [17]. As is
often the case, none of these studies addresses the miR-124
targets studied by others, so that comparative analysis of
the different processes in which this miR might be involved
is virtually impossible at the present time.
Another brain-enriched REST-targeting NeurimmiR,
miR-9, shows decreases in Huntington’s disease [18]. By

Several NeurimmiR-related processes involve measurable
developmental or deterioration changes of neuronal and
hematopoietic pathways. Figure 1 schematically presents
how NeurimmiR functioning might be viewed as operating
within and between the neural and immune worlds, with
each interaction affecting both cognitive and immune features in a multi-layered fashion. A prominent example is

Box 2. Neuroinflammation, cognition and the anti-inflammatory reflex
Neuroinflammation is an immune response initiated by the innate
immunity arm of the CNS, and sometimes mediated by the adaptive
arm, which involves increases in proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, complement factors, reactive oxygen species and other agents,
secreted by either resident or infiltrating leukocytes. In human patients,
neuroinflammation is triggered by injury and aging, and peripheral
immune challenges emerge as being involved in a wide range of CNS
diseases such as AD, MS, PD and ALS [3]. Proinflammatory cytokines
affect hippocampal LTP, neuronal differentiation and neurogenesis.
Elevated levels of such cytokines have been found in the CNS of aged
and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients, particularly in brain
regions associated with learning, memory and cognition. Compatible
with this, inflammation affects emotions and mood, causing a
depression-like state. Moreover, systemic inflammation increases
cytokine production, most importantly IL-1b, which is capable of
modulating the HPA axis, thereby enhancing anxiety-initiating bodyto-brain signals [2]. The brain’s immune system consists of various
subsets of macrophage-associated cells, most notably the microglia
[62]. Experimental exposure to proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1b, protein aggregates such as Ab or self antigens such as the MOG
peptide induces activation of astrocytes and microglia, leading to
further expression of cytokines and leukocyte recruitment in a feed-

forward loop. Following peripheral LPS injection, such increases are
accompanied by impaired cognitive functions (e.g. hippocampusdependent learning tasks) and altered neuronal differentiation. Braininfiltrating leukocytes secrete proinflammatory cytokines, reactive
oxygen species and others that might both be detrimental to neurons
and activate surrounding resting microglia, suggesting involvement in
disease initiation and progression by the interlocked neuroimmune
communication pathways.
The ascending fibers of the vagus nerve can signal the presence of
peripheral inflammation to the brain, through cytokine receptors
expressed by parasympathetic ganglia cells [2]. Reciprocally, macrophages and dendritic cells, T cells and B cells can react to ACh released
from the descending fibers of the vagus nerve or from internal or
peripheral sources, such as the splenic nerve. In cells exposed to
inflammatory insults, NF-k-B translocates into the nucleus, and downstream inflammatory products are expressed and secreted. Cholinergic
activation of the nicotinic a7 receptor interferes with this translocation
and limits the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Overall, ACh has
an anti-inflammatory effect, dubbed ‘the cholinergic anti-inflammatory
reflex’ [2]. By contrast, extensive ACh hydrolysis by AChE exerts a
proinflammatory output; thus, counteracting AChE activity by miR-132
exerts a net anti-inflammatory effect [35].

Figure 1. NeurimmiRs as mediators of brain immune-modulation. (a) Peripheral immune insults activate macrophages and induce the expression of blood-borne
proinflammatory agents, which enhance leukocyte activation. Insults such as traumatic brain injury increase blood–brain barrier (BBB) penetration of both cytokines and
cytokine secreting leukocytes, with direct effects on neurons or neighboring resting microglia. Consequent changes in the expression of NeurimmiRs alter both neuron–glia
interactions and neuronal functions, affecting plasticity, neurotransmission, neurodegeneration and neurodevelopment. Other events such as drug consumption and
mental stress can affect neuroinflammation as well as neuronal functions, thus NeurimmiRs might also participate in the modulation of these neuroimmune processes.
Those miRs shown in italic are predicted to have functionality based on their corresponding mRNA targets. (b) Following rapid activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs), such
as TLR4, downstream proinflammatory cytokines are secreted. During this time, miR-132 levels are low, which means that acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is expressed and
hydrolyzes acetylcholine (ACh) secreted from the vagus nerve, perpetuating inflammation. (c) When TLR signaling elevates miR-132 levels, AChE activity is suppressed,
potentiating cholinergic anti-inflammatory transmission [60]. Abbreviations: MF, macrophages; Cyt, cytokine; Chem, chemokine; NO, nitric oxide; MS, multiple sclerosis;

regulating the transcription factor FoxP1, miR-9 promotes
spinal columnar organization [19]. Correspondingly, miR-9
is downregulated in an animal model of spinal muscular
atrophy (SMA) [20]. By destabilizing a splice variant of the
large-conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channel (BK) [21] miR-9 was proposed to modulate
neuroadaptation to alcohol. In myeloid cells, miR-9 targets
the vital inflammatory transcription factor NF-k-B1 and is
upregulated following exposure to activators of the innate
immune toll-like receptors (TLRs) or proinflammatory
cytokines [22]. Similarly bifunctional is miR-125b, which
modulates the morphology and excitability of neurons
through its Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)

target [23], and was recently shown, in an exceptionally
wide-scoped study, to promote neurite growth through its
capacity to target multiple transcripts [24]. MiR-125b also
modulates lymphoid cell differentiation and targets the
mRNA of the critical proinflammatory cytokine TNF-a,
suggesting a significant role in the regulation and resolution of inflammation [25].
Following peripheral or central immune insults, immune cell changes in NeurimmiR levels might influence
neuronal functions, whether directly by suppressing genes
within neurons or indirectly by influencing the functioning
of immune or supporting glial cells. For example, miR-155
regulates T cell and B cell differentiation as well as

dendritic cell function by targeting the SHIP-1 inositol
phosphatase and controlling IL-1 signaling [26]. In a
human-derived neuronal cell line, the mature MiR-155
can also target the methyl-CpG binding protein 2
(MeCP2), a co-activator of REST, and is deregulated in
Down and Rett’s syndrome and other neurodevelopmental
diseases [27]. Mice that are null for miR155 (miR155–/–)
show significantly reduced numbers of encephalogenic
CD4+ Th17 cells, an inflammatory T cell subset known
to have a significant role in MS and react to the neuroinflammatory stimulus of the MOG peptide by increased
proliferation of CD4+ Th17 cells. Also, miR155–/– CD4+ T
cells failed to passively induce the EAE experimental
model of MS when transferred to lymphocyte-deficient
animals [26]. In addition, impaired regulation of SHIP-1
and the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) in
miR155–/– dendritic cells reduces the Th17 regulating
cytokines IL-6 and IL-23. A similar role was proposed
for miR-326, which regulates the Th17 cells by targeting
the transcription factor Est-1 [28]. Both miRs were overexpressed in astrocytes derived from MS lesions in human
patients and were suggested to modulate phagocytosis of
neighboring neurons by regulating the macrophage/
microglial SIRPa protein [29]. By deregulating Th17
and myeloid cell functions, miR-155 and miR-326 emerge
as MS-associated NeurimmiRs.
Other NeurimmiR examples include the NF-k-B-dependent miR-146a, which is upregulated in the brain of AD
patients and might enhance inflammation by targeting the
inflammation-repressing complement factor H (CFH) [9].
MiR-146a is also upregulated in the hippocampus of both
temporal lobe epilepsy patients and a rat epilepsy model
[8]. Under HIV-1 infection, miR-146a elevation in human
microglia supports the fine-tuning of immune functions by
targeting the chemokine CCL8/MCP-2 [30]. Within the
TLR innate immune pathway, miR146a suppresses the
TRAF6 and IRAK1/2 proteins, potentially enhancing RIG-I
mediated interferon-1 (IFN-1) production [5] and suggesting multiple routes contributing to microglial function.
Of note, different NeurimmiRs show overlapping patterns of immune-related changes: LPS-exposed human
monocytes show upregulation of both miR-146a and miR155, whereas TNF-a exposure upregulates miR-155 and
miR-125b [25]. Similar to miR-155, miR-146a is also associated with MeCP2 because this miR is downregulated in the
Rett syndrome model (MeCP2–/– animals) [31]. Furthermore, MeCP2 regulates the expression of miRs [32] and
miR-146a can downregulate the IL-1 signaling protein
IRAK1 both in neurons and in myeloid cells, suggesting
its involvement in the neuroimmune crosstalk by IL-1. The
evidence accumulated so far is compatible with the theory
that a single NeurimmiR affects a pathway of inter-related
transcripts, all involved in a cellular process, rather than
single proteins. Because of the tendency of miR studies to
focus on one protein–one miR interaction, the global miR
effect on different pathways is often overlooked. One such
example is miR-1, which was shown to coregulate several
cholinergic-signaling related proteins in the neuromuscular
junction of Caenorhabditis elegans [33]. Others proposed
that the capacity of several miRs to target key regulatory
transcripts associated with the same process ensures tight

regulation [34]. Thus, the complete scope of NeurimmiRs
functioning in the neuroimmune interface appears to be
central.
Inflammation controlling NeurimmiRs are implicated in
multiple syndromes
Inflammation is primarily aimed at fighting invading pathogens and is terminated by reciprocal brain-to-body signals.
Most elderly individuals show excessive inflammation, suggesting failure of their natural control mechanisms [2]. In
the mammalian brain, aging is associated with miR changes
which have been associated with increases in inflammatory
markers in astrocytes, microglia and neurons, as well as
with reduced neurogenesis, increased neuron death and
neurodegenerative processes [3,7]. The causes for the
heightened inflammatory state in advanced age or the
impact of inflammation on aging in general are not well
understood, but NeurimmiRs that target transcripts involved in the neuroimmune interface (e.g. miR-125b, miR132 and miR-146a) are probably involved, which makes
them promising targets for interference with the hope of
reducing age-associated inflammation.
Recent findings demonstrate that small RNAs functioning within the neuroimmune interface play a significant
role in controlling the bidirectional communication line
between neuronal circuits and inflammatory processes
[35]. For example, in Parkinson’s disease (PD), where
neuroinflammation is a central component, mutated
LRRK2 globally interferes with miR-mediated processes
[36], whereas Let-7 targets the PD hallmark fibril-forming
protein a-synuclein [37]. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS), upregulating miR-206 was shown to reinnervate
damaged neuromuscular junctions by targeting histone
deacetylase 4 [38]. Specifically, NeurimmiR alterations
under peripheral or central inflammation are compatible
with the hypothesis that these changes contribute to the
emergence of several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions (Table 1). Peripheral immune insults and/
or BBB promiscuity [11] induce the secretion and brain
penetration of inflammatory agents and leukocytes, which
would consequently modify NeurimmiRs expression in the
CNS. Although the direct association of such miR changes
with neuronal function and malfunction is yet to be confirmed, NeurimmiRs are primarily adapted for such bodyto-brain signaling in the rapidly growing field of neuroimmunity. For exploring the relevance of this phenomenon,
we can turn to the well-investigated brain-enriched miR132, which was implicated with body-to-brain communication [35], as a case study.
MiR-132 transcription is controlled both by the cyclicAMP response element binding protein (CREB) [35], a
transcription factor classically involved in learning and
memory as well as in neural growth, and by the neuronal
growth factor BDNF that is associated with cholinergic
functioning. MiR-132 transfection suppresses the Rho family GTPase activating protein p250GAP while enhancing
neurite sprouting in cortical neurons, compatible with
miR-132 upregulation during postnatal development and
with the attenuation of neurite growth by miR-132-targeted antisense oligonucleotides [39]. MiR-132 was also
predicted to target several ion channels, and thus affect cell

excitability; correspondingly, overexpressed pri-miR-132
potentiates glutamate, NMDA, or K+-mediated depolarization of cultured neurons, suggesting global involvement
in regulating neurotransmission and plasticity. However,
involvement of other putative miR-132 targets has not
been tested in these experiments, which leaves the detailed
mechanisms underlying the neuronal growth effects of
miR-132 incompletely understood.
In transfected cultured neurons, miR-132 leads to wider
and shorter dendritic spines, accompanied by increased
miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents [23]. In newborn
hippocampal neurons, Cre-lox mediated deletion of miR-132
decreases dendritic length and arborization in adult mice
[40], supporting a role for miR-132 in neuronal differentiation, synaptogenesis and maintenance. Conversely, cells
transfected with the TNF-a-inducible miR-125b extend long
and thin spines and show reduced excitatory postsynaptic
currents. Both miR-132 and miR-125b were co-immunoprecipitated with FMRP, and FMRP knockdown abolished the
morphological effects of both miR-132 and miR-125b. This
suggested that miR-132 and miR-125b balance each other’s
effects through competitive interaction with FMRP [23].
Compatible with the stress-associated alteration of cholinergic signaling, miR-132 was upregulated in the hippocampus of chronically stressed rats [41]. Another miR-132 target
is the light-induced transcription regulatory factor X 4
552

(RFX4), abundant in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
of the hypothalamus, which regulates biological clocks and
rhythms. MiR-132 levels are higher during the light part of
the circadian cycle in the SCN [42]. Infused antisense
oligonucleotide against miR-132 (AntagoMir) impaired
the resetting of the circadian clock while elevating RFX4.
In this case as well, no other possible targets were measured
in live mice.
Cultured human monocytes react to LPS by overexpressing the NeurimmiRs miR-146a, miR-155 and miR-132 [5].
Correspondingly, all three miRs are increased in the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis [43]. In human lymphatic endothelial cells infected with Kaposi’s sarcomaassociated virus, as well as in viral or bacterial-infected
brain tissue, miR-132 induces transcriptional arrest by
downregulating the CREB co-activator p300 [44]. This inhibits both inflammatory cytokines and antiviral genes, indicating that stress-induced facilitation of anti-inflammatory
protection, which would also support cognitive alertness,
might take its toll by compromising anti-viral immune
functions. Because p300 is also a coactivator of the developing brain, this process may further intensify the damaging
effects of viral infection in neuronal development.
At the body-to-brain communication level, miR-132 regulates cholinergic anti-inflammatory signaling by potentiating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (Box 2)

Opinion
Box 3. Outstanding questions
 Do NeurimmiRs function similarly within peripheral leukocytes
and in CNS resident and infiltrating leukocytes?
 To what degree do changes in NeurimmiRs contribute to the
onset and development of neuropathologies?
 Can NeurimmiR levels and functions be manipulated for interfering with neuropathologies with inflammatory components?

[35]. By targeting acetylcholinesterase (AChE), miR-132
lowers acetylcholine (ACh) hydrolysis. Both gain- and lossof-function experiments validated the miR-132/AChE interaction; miR-132 overexpression by lentivirus infection
reduces AChE activity, whereas mutagenesis of the miR132 binding site in AChE mRNA elevates it. Correspondingly, in vivo antisense suppression of miR-132 levels
increases AChE activity in the intestine, spleen and serum.
Furthermore, mice expressing an AChE transgene devoid
of the miR-132 binding site lose the ability to control
inflammation via ACh and show altered thermoregulation
under inflammatory insults, despite their intact response
to nicotine. These mice present higher miR-132 levels in
the inflammation-responding hypothalamus and the bone
marrow. This would predictably enhance the cholinergic
output, potentiating cholinergic anti-inflammatory signaling [2] and contributing to the resolution of inflammation
in both macrophages and intestinal tissues (Figure 1a,b).
However, the relative contributions of p300, CREB and
AChE suppression to the anti-inflammatory effects of miR132 await further studies (Box 3).
Future implications of NeurimmiRs in inherited and
acquired diseases
Studying miR involvement in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders is still at a pioneering level, but some of
the players are highly likely to be NeurimmiRs. A microdeletion in the 22q11.2 region, known to be associated with
schizophrenia and autism [45], disrupts DGCR8, a component of the miR biogenesis pathway, which in turn impairs
proper miR biogenesis [46]. In the amygdala of stressed
rats, miR-134 and miR-183 are both elevated, where MiR183 targets the stress-inducible splice factor SC35, which
modulates the stress-responsive alternative splicing of
AChE mRNA [41]. Cholinergic signaling also initiates
increases in the hematopoietic miR-181a, which is also
present in the CNS [47]. Several other miRs were implicated in a number of neurological, neurodevelopmental
and neurodegeneration disorders (Table 1) [7,10,47].
AD is an intriguing target for NeurimmiR manipulations. As yet, no unbiased comprehensive study has definitively identified and validated those sets of miRs that drive
the aberrant regulation of neuroimmune processes in the
AD-damaged brain regions, so that the selection of NeurimmiR targets for interference with AD, like the scope of
the affected processes, remains incomplete. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the neuroimmune components of AD, such as the presence of complement system
factors within the CNS, is associated with miR expression
and can thus influence downstream neuronal functions
[48]. Correspondingly, NeurimmiRs such as miR-132
and miR-9 are downregulated, whereas miR-125b is

upregulated in the hippocampus and medial frontal gyrus
of AD patients [49]. An intriguing leukocyte subset for
NeurimmiRs screening is the microglia, a population in
which only a handful of miRs were described [10,30,50].
Because microglia express functional anti-inflammatory
ACh receptors [51], the miR-132/AChE connection is a
promising candidate for studying the corresponding NeurimmiR regulatory effects. Several miR-132 target genes,
most notably regulators of transcription such as MeCP2
and p300, highlight such neuroimmune functions (Table 1).
As miRs can regulate cognitive processes, impairments in
their functioning might also be especially risky for psychiatric disorders.
Once produced, miRs are likely to act relatively quickly,
due to their post-transcriptional mode of activity. By sharing multiple regulatory targets with many other miRs and
being susceptible for numerous regulatory processes, each
miR is subject to a tight but flexible network of checks and
balances, which in normal circumstances ensure gradual
tuning rather than a complete arrest of their target processes. This and the brain-to-body activities of NeurimmiRs as proposed in this review, further points at the
challenging yet promising potential of altering miR activities for therapeutic purposes (Box 3). Thus, in syndromes
involving AChE suppression, including imbalanced cognition, impaired cholinergic signaling and autoimmune syndromes, oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of miR-132
should help by elevating AChE [35]. Although approximately 20-mer miR-size oligonucleotides are unlikely to
cross the BBB, peripheral administration would change
the levels of cytokines, which can penetrate and affect the
brain indirectly.
At the genome level, miR-132 is encoded in tandem with
miR-212 within 300 base pairs at the same chromosomal
location. These two miRs share an identical ‘seed’ sequence
and might share the same transcript, forming the miR-132/
miR-212 cluster, which suggests common regulation and
mutual targets. The miR-132/miR-212 complex is overexpressed in schizophrenic and bipolar brain tissues [52]
and in the dorsal striatum of a rat model for cocaine
addiction [53]. However, a recent report singled out
miR-132 as the prime partner of this cluster in neuronal
differentiation, with little effect attributed to miR-212 [40],
suggesting that this dual cluster might not always operate
as a single entity.
Of note, several NeurimmiRs associate with different
components of the REST/MeCP2 complex: miR-9 directly
targets REST, miR-124 targets the REST complex component SCP1, miR-155 targets MeCP2, miR-146a is regulated by MeCP2 and the miR-132/miR-212 cluster directly
targets the REST cofactor MeCP2. Recent reports describe
other MeCP2-associated miRs to be involved with neuronal
differentiation [32], suggesting that these miRs might also
act as NeurimmiRs. During the progression of Huntington’s disease, miR-132 levels increase [18], REST binding
to the regulatory huntingtin protein is impaired and miR-9
levels decrease in a feedback response. Inverse to the
excessive susceptibility of MeCP2–/– mice to ischemic damage, miR-132 levels decrease and MeCP2 levels increase in
rapid ischemic preconditioning, which protects the brain
from subsequent prolonged ischemia [54].

Opinion
Biomedical tools that are being developed for miR modulations include, but are not limited to, chemically protected AntagoMir oligonucleotides for suppressing
targeted miRs [35], miR mimics for potentiating their
action [55] and lentiviral tools for long-term manipulations
[44,56]. Further experiments must be undertaken to establish the efficacy of these potential minimally intrusive
manipulations for neuroinflammatory conditions. Promising examples involve AD-related downregulation of the
miR-29ab-1 cluster [57] and of miR-107 in a double transgenic mouse AD model [58], all associated with b-amyloid
precursor protein-converting enzyme (BACE1), which presumably contributes to AD development, and the predicted
regulation of BACE1 by miR-298 and miR-328 [59].
Concluding remarks
The field of miR research has undergone a wide-ranging
expansion in the last decade. However, the multiple modes
of function of these small RNAs have hampered the progress in understanding the full scope of their effects. This is
particularly the case for miRs involved in neuroimmune
maladies, which we have named NeurimmiRs. Both peripheral and central immune insults have already been
shown to upregulate various NeurimmiRs, either in neurons, surrounding cells (e.g. glia, microglia and infiltrating
leukocytes) or in peripheral leukocytes. We propose that
miRs are involved in regulating neuroimmune functions
both due to central control and by peripheral immune cells
sending back messages; such messages alert the central
command, leading to a complex set of bidirectional feedback consequences. Owing to their physical properties and
multiple roles in the nervous and immune systems, NeurimmiRs may initiate such communication cascades both in
health and disease and their manipulation can be therapeutically useful. To progress toward this goal, several
open questions remain to be addressed (Box 3). By contributing to the monitoring by the brain of cognition and
inflammation alike, as well as to the detrimental effects
of systemic and chronic changes in immune functions in
neurodegenerative diseases, these miRs might be prime
candidates for therapeutic intervention for neuroimmune
impairments.
