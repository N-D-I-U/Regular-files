Neuroimaging techniques have evolved over the past several years giving us unprecedented information
about the degenerative process in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other movement disorders. Functional
imaging approaches such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerised
tomography (SPECT) have been successfully employed to detect dopaminergic dysfunction in PD, even while
at a preclinical stage, and to demonstrate the effects of therapies on function of intact dopaminergic neurons
within the affected striatum. PET and SPECT can also monitor PD progression as reﬂected by changes in brain
levodopa and glucose metabolism and dopamine transporter binding. Structural imaging approaches include
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial sonography (TCS). Recent advances in voxel-based
morphometry and diffusion-weighted MRI have provided exciting potential applications for the differential
diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, detected with TCS, may provide a
marker of susceptibility to PD, probably reﬂecting disturbances of iron metabolism, but does not appear to
correlate well with disease severity or change with disease progression. In the future novel radiotracers may
help us assess the involvement of non-dopaminergic brain pathways in the pathology of both motor and
non-motor complications in PD.

1. Introduction
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative neurological
disorder, characterized by asymmetric onset of resting tremor, rigidity,
and bradykinesia in the limbs followed by postural instability. The
disease is uncommon before the sixth decade and the prevalence rates
increase with age. Results from seven population-based studies
performed in European countries suggest that the overall prevalence
of PD in people aged over 65 is 1.8%, with an increase from 0.6% for
persons aged 65 to 69 years to 2.6% for people aged 85 to 89 years [1].
Progression of symptoms in PD may occur over 10–30 years but can be
accelerated in some individuals [2].
The cardinal pathological feature of the disease consists of the
formation of proteinaceous intraneuronal Lewy body inclusions and
Lewy neurites and progressive neuronal loss particularly targeting the
substantia nigra. Using synuclein immunocytochemistry, it has been
observed that intraneuronal Lewy body inclusions can be detected in
the lower brainstem ahead of midbrain and nigral involvement and
later spread to limbic and association cortical areas in a predictable
manner [3]. Based on this observation Braak et al. have proposed a sixpoint staging procedure for the pathological process in PD. They
propose that Lewy body pathology begins in the medulla oblongata
and olfactory structures in stage 1 and spreads to the pons by stage 2.
The substantia nigra (SN) and midbrain brain nuclei are affected

during stage 3 and limbic areas in stage 4. Eventually, in stages 5 to 6,
the inclusions appear in the neocortex. Despite these ﬁndings of
widespread Lewy body disease, the hallmark of PD pathology is the
loss of the dopaminergic neurons in the SN pars compacta (SNc)
which results in striatal dopamine deﬁciency. This in turn leads to
increased inhibitory output activity from the basal ganglia to the
ventral thalamus and frontal cortex and subsequent development of
parkinsonism. It has been estimated that classical PD symptoms
appear when 80% of striatal dopamine and 50% of the nigra compacta
cells have been lost [4].
Over the past two decades, neuroimaging techniques such as
positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
transcranial sonography have increasingly been employed to detect
PD, to elucidate the neuropathological mechanisms and compensatory responses underlying symptoms and treatment associated
complications, and to monitor disease progression in vivo. This
paper reviews the different contributions of neuroimaging to the
ﬁeld, with a focus on the assessment of nigrostriatal degeneration. The
involvement of other brain structures and neurotransmitter systems,
which may be responsible for the onset of non-motor symptoms in PD
patients, will also be discussed.

parkinsonian disorders. Both modalities provide a means of assessing:
(1) disease severity as reﬂected by presynaptic dopamine terminal
dysfunction, (2) subclinical dysfunction in subjects who are at risk for PD,
(3) disease progression and the effects on this of putative neuroprotective agents, and (4) changes in non-dopaminergic neurotransmission.
Additionally, PET studies with the peripheral benzodiazepine
ligand 11C-(R)-PK11195, a selective marker of activated microglia [5],
have been used for imaging brain inﬂammation in vivo in PD patients
and to help clarify the role of activated microglia in the ongoing
degenerative process.
2.1. Presynaptic dopaminergic function
Assessment of the functional integrity of presynaptic nigrostriatal
projections is a major goal for the functional imaging techniques used
in the evaluation of patients with parkinsonian features. At present,
three different markers of presynaptic dopaminergic terminals are
commonly studied; these are discussed below and summarized in
Table 1.
2.1.1. Measurement of striatal aromatic amino acid
decarboxylase activity
18
F-dopa PET was the ﬁrst neuroimaging technique validated for
the assessment of presynaptic dopaminergic integrity. The uptake of
18
F-dopa in the striatal nuclei over 90 min, as measured by an inﬂux
constant Ki, reﬂects both the density of the axonal terminal plexus
and the activity of the striatal aromatic amino acid decarboxylase
(AADC), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 18F-dopa to
18
F-dopamine. Measurements of 18F-dopa uptake in the striatum of
patients with PD will, therefore, be inﬂuenced by the number of
remaining dopaminergic cells. This is supported by pathological
studies which have demonstrated that levels of striatal 18F-dopa
uptake correlated well with nigral cell counts in both human cases
and in non-human primates where parkinsonism was induced by the
nigral toxin MPTP [6,7]. However, particularly in early stages of
disease, 18F-dopa PET may underestimate the degenerative process
due to the presence of compensatory upregulation of AADC in
remaining terminals [8].
Putamen uptake of 18F-dopa in PD has been shown to correlate
with the clinical severity of locomotor disability as measured by the
Uniﬁed Parkinson's Disease Rating scale (UPDRS) [9–11]. Interestingly,
while putamen 18F-dopa reductions correlate well with the degree of
rigidity and bradykinesia in PD this is not true of tremor severity
suggesting that either non-nigrostriatal and/or non-dopaminergic
pathways are implicated in the pathogenesis of this symptom.

723

Typically, PD patients show a gradient of reduced striatal 18F-dopa
uptake along a rostro-caudal axis. Patients with hemiparkinsonism
have their greatest 18F-dopa uptake reduction in the dorsal posterior
putamen contralateral to the side of clinical symptoms [12]. As the
disease progresses to become bilateral, additional reductions are seen
within the ventral and anterior putamen and dorsal caudate. In the
most advanced stages, uptake within the ventral head of caudate also
falls. These 18F-dopa PET ﬁndings are in line with post-mortem data
that have reported an uneven pattern of dopamine loss in the striatum
in PD, posterior dorsal putamen being targeted. Nigral cell counts are
lowest in ventrolateral subregions which send dopaminergic projections to the dorsal putamen. [4,13]
Reductions of 18F-dopa uptake in PD can be localised at a voxel
level across the whole brain by interrogating PET images with
statistical parametric mapping (SPM). This analytical approach has
made it possible to detect changes in 18F-dopa uptake in extrastriatal
as well as striatal regions and to explore compensatory responses to
the neurodegenerative process at different stages of the disease.
With SPM, several authors have reported increases in 18F-dopa
uptake in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and globus pallidus interna of patients with early PD compared to both
normal controls and patients with more advanced disease [14–16]. It
is likely that these increases in extrastriatal 18Fdopa uptake in early
PD reﬂect compensatory upregulation of AADC though some uptake
of 18F-dopa into serotonergic terminals may also be a contributor.
Whone et al. observed a 40% increase in 18F-dopa uptake in the
globus pallidus interna in early PD which was then lost in advanced
disease as motor ﬂuctuations developed [16]. It may well be that
raised pallidal dopamine storage in early PD is important for
normalising basal ganglia output to the ventral thalamus and
motor cortex and, when pallidal as well as putamen dopamine
storage fails, motor responses to levodopa therapy become ﬂuctuating and unpredictable.
2.1.2. Measurement of presynaptic dopamine transporter binding
The presynaptic dopamine transporter (DAT) is the plasma
membrane transporter responsible for the high-afﬁnity uptake of
dopamine. It is found exclusively in dendrites and axons of dopaminergic neurons and is therefore a potential marker of integrity
of nigrostriatal projections. Several PET ligands (11C-CFT, 18F-CFT,
18
F-FP-CIT, and 11C-RTI-32) and SPECT tracers (such as 123I-β-CIT,
123
I-FP-CIT, 123I-altropane, 11C-methylphenidate, and 99mTc-TRODAT1) are now available to measure DAT availability.
123
I-β-CIT, a tropane derivative, binds with equal nanomolar
afﬁnity to DAT, noradrenergic (NART), and serotonergic (SERT)
transporters. Striatal uptake at 24 h post-injection primarily reﬂects
DAT binding whereas brainstem uptake at 1 h post-injection reﬂects
SERT binding. Similarly to 18F-dopa, striatal 123I-β-CIT uptake
correlates well with stage of disease and symptom severity in PD,
particularly with bradykinesia but not rest tremor [17–19]. A
disadvantage of 123I-β-CIT is its slow striatal uptake kinetics. It takes
24 h to equilibrate in this brain region following its administration so
SPECT must be delayed to the following day. More recently developed
SPECT tracers such as 123I-FP-CIT, 123I-altropane, and 123I-PE21, have
faster uptake kinetics though they give higher non-speciﬁc signals. In
practice diagnostic scans can be performed within 2 to 3 h of tracer
administration. 99mTc-TRODAT-1 has the advantage of being technetium based and so available in kit form. Its speciﬁc signal, however, is
lower than the 123I based SPECT tracers.
In general, all these DAT markers show similar ﬁndings in PD to
those seen with 18F-dopa PET and are able to differentiate early PD
from normal subjects with a sensitivity of around 90%. In contrast to
18
F-dopa, striatal uptake of DAT ligands in early PD may overestimate
the reduction in terminal density due to the relative downregulation
of DAT in remaining neurons as a response to nigral neuron loss in
order to maintain synaptic dopamine levels. While striatal 18F-dopa

724

does not appear to be age dependent in healthy subjects, DAT binding
falls with age [20–22].
2.1.3. Measurement of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2
The type-2 vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) is exclusively
expressed in the brain and is responsible for the uptake of monoamines
from the cytoplasm into the secretory vesicles in dopamine neurones
[23]. 11C-dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) is a PET tracer that binds to
VMAT2. Lee et al. compared striatal uptake of 11C-dihydrotetrabenazine,
18
F-dopa, and the DAT ligand 11C-methylphenidate in PD. They
found that 18F-dopa Ki was reduced relatively less than the 11Cdihydrotetrabenazine binding potential in the parkinsonian striatum,
while 11C-dihydrotetrabenazine binding was reduced less than 11Cmethylphenidate binding [24]. This ﬁnding is in line with the presence
of relative AADC upregulation and DAT downregulation in the
striatum of parkinsonian patients in order to increase dopamine
turnover and diminish its re-uptake. The authors propose that 11Cdihydrotetrabenazine PET gives the most reliable measurement of the
density of dopaminergic terminals. This suggestion, however, remains
to be validated by comparing 11C-dihydrotetrabenazine striatal binding
with post-mortem nigral cell counts and demonstrating that dopaminergic drugs have no effect on tracer uptake.
Fig. 1 shows striatal uptake of different PET and SPECT tracers in
healthy controls and early Parkinson's disease.
2.2. Detection of subclinical disease
Measures of dopaminergic presynaptic integrity with both 18F-dopa
PET and 123I-β-CIT SPECT have allowed detection of subclinical
dysfunction in subjects who are at risk for PD. Reductions in 18F-dopa
putaminal uptake has been reported in 18% of asymptomatic dizygotic
co-twins and in 55% of asymptomatic monozygotic co-twins of patients
with idiopathic PD. Over the 4-year follow-up of this study, two of ten
asymptomatic monozygotic co-twins subsequently developed clinical
parkinsonism and all 10 subjects showed a further decrease in putaminal
18
F-dopa uptake [25]. A signiﬁcant reduction of putaminal 18F-dopa
uptake has also been reported in around 25% of asymptomatic siblings
in kindreds with familial PD, and about one-third of those with
abnormal imaging developed clinical parkinsonism over a ﬁve-year
follow-up [26]. These ﬁndings support a role of inheritance in PD, but
do not fully rule out the effect of possible concomitant environmental
factors.

PARK2 is a recessive form of Parkinson's disease caused by parkin
gene mutations. Recently, two separate studies [27,28] have reported
reductions of striatal 18F-dopa uptake in asymptomatic carriers of a
single parkin mutation compared to normal subjects. Longitudinal
studies are now required to establish whether these subjects will
convert to clinical PD later on in life.
123
I-β-CIT SPECT has been used to evaluate dopamine terminal
integrity in relatives of PD patients with no parkinsonian symptoms
but with a complaint of idiopathic hyposmia, a known risk factor for
PD. 11% of the relatives exhibited hyposmia on UPSIT testing and
17.5% (7 out of 40) of these siblings with hyposmia had reduced
striatal 123I-β-CIT binding. 57% (4 out of 7) of those hyposmic relatives
with subclinically reduced DAT binding converted to clinical PD over a
2-year follow-up [29]. While 123I-β-CIT SPECT can detect subclinical
dysfunction in PD relatives only 2% in total, however, exhibit both
hyposmia and dopaminergic loss.
2.3. Disease progression and the effects of putative
neuroprotective agents
Both PET and SPECT have been used to monitor the progression of
nigrostriatal degeneration in PD. Several series have now demonstrated that the loss of striatal 18F-dopa uptake occurs more rapidly in
PD patients than in age-matched controls [30–33]. In these studies the
mean annual rate of 18F-dopa uptake decline in PD patients has been
reported to range from 8% to 12% in the putamen and 4% to 6% in the
caudate, whereas the annual decline in normal volunteers is lower
than 1% (0.5% and 0.7% in the putamen and in the caudate
respectively) [33]. It has been suggested that the absolute rate of
decline does not vary between different regions of the striatum. In a
5-year longitudinal study with 18F-dopa PET, Nurmi et al. evaluated the
annual rate of decline of tracer uptake in different striatal subregions
[33]. They found a 10.3% annual reduction in 18F-dopa uptake in the
posterior putamen and an 8.3% reduction in the anterior putamen.
Caudate nucleus showed a 5.9% annual reduction. The absolute rate of
decline however was similar in all striatal subregions. An analogous
study was performed in 31 untreated patients with early PD [34].
Patients were studied with 18F-dopa PET twice, at the time of the
diagnosis and 2 years later. Results from this study also indicate a
similar rate of progression between the subregions of the striatum.
Based on this evidence 18F-dopa PET provides a reliable biological
marker of the progression of PD. It has been argued, however, that

18
F-dopa PET and 123I-β-CIT SPECT have been used as biomarkers of
disease progression when assessing the efﬁcacy of putative neuroprotective agents. Over the past years, clinical trials have been
performed to evaluate the effects of dopamine agonists, levodopa,
and possible neuroprotective agents such as riluzole and CEP1347 on
the natural course of the disease in PD patients [41–47] (Table 2). In all
these studies, drug efﬁcacy was evaluated using both clinical and
imaging outcome measures. The clinical endpoints in studies
comparing dopamine agonists and levodopa have generally been the
incidence or prevalence of dyskinesias after a given time interval. In
studies of other possible neuroprotective agents the time to requiring
levodopa treatment in de novo patients is a frequent measure of
efﬁcacy. Imaging outcomes were typically the change in dopamine
terminal function between baseline and end-of-study evaluation as
assessed by 18F-dopa PET or 123I-β-CIT SPECT.
To date, functional imaging studies in these trials have failed to
demonstrate a clear-cut neuroprotective effect on nigrostriatal
degeneration of agonists or other agents. In addition, discordance
between clinical and imaging outcomes has been reported in
dopamine agonist vs levodopa studies. Whereas dopamine terminal
function declined more slowly when early PD patients were treated
with dopamine agonists, as judged by imaging, the response of their
parkinsonism was poorer. The ELLDOPA study was a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the effect of
levodopa itself on the rate of progression of PD. Levodopa improved the
clinical status of de novo PD cases over 9 months, even after a 2 week
withdrawal period, but the mean percent decline in the 123I-β-CIT
uptake over this period was signiﬁcantly greater with levodopa than
placebo [46].
The poor correlation between clinical changes over time and
decline in 18F-dopa or 123I-β-CIT uptake in studies comparing
levodopa with placebo or agonists raises the issue of differential
direct effects of these dopaminergic medications on imaging parameters acting as a confounding factor. Levodopa may act to depress
DAT binding and AADC activity relative to dopamine agonists. The
ﬁndings certainly prevent the use of these imaging techniques as
surrogate biomarkers of disease progression. Additionally, if dopamine agonists are indeed neuroprotective or levodopa neurotoxic
these effects may be masked by the greater clinical efﬁcacy of the
latter, particularly when short wash-out periods are employed. Finally,
clinical rating scales are vulnerable to both patient and evaluator
subjectivity. Further trials, possibly in untreated patients and with
better study designs and longer wash-out periods are, therefore,
needed in order to determine the contribution of possible confounding factors and to better validate imaging outcomes as biomarkers of
disease progression. Despite the above criticisms, however, functional
imaging still offers an objective method of assessing disease
progression in PD. In trials of direct infusion of the growth factor
GDNF [48] and implantation of fetal dopamine cells [49] into putamen
18
F-dopa PET provided proof of mechanism by detecting increased
dopamine storage capacity after these treatments.

decreases in striatal 18F-dopa uptake over time may not provide an
accurate measure of the neurodegenerative process as they reﬂect
both neuronal loss and failure of compensatory mechanisms (AADC
upregulation). Fig. 2 shows images of 18F-dopa uptake in a PD patient
at baseline and after 2 years follow-up.
123
I-β-CIT, 123I-FP-CIT, and 123I-IPT SPECT and 18F-CFT PET have all
been used to monitor the rate of the loss of DAT binding in PD. Several
123
I-β-CIT SPECT studies have evaluated the rate of PD progression and
reported similar rates of the loss of putamen dopamine transporters
with a mean 8% annual decline [19,35–37]. A confounding factor when
assessing disease progression with 123I-β-CIT SPECT is that tracer
uptake decreases with age (3.3% to 10% per decade) in healthy
subjects [20–22].
Nurmi et al. [38] have used 18F-CFT PET to investigate DAT loss in
striatal subregions in patients with early PD. At variance with previous
18
F-dopa PET ﬁndings, they found that the decline in tracer uptake was
signiﬁcantly different in anterior and posterior putamen. When the
rates of progression were calculated compared to the normal control
mean, the caudate had the highest rate of progression (5.6%), followed
by the anterior putamen (5.3%) and then the posterior putamen
(3.3%). Additionally, the absolute decline in 18F-CFT PET uptake was
greater in the less affected putamen. If conﬁrmed in larger longitudinal studies, this ﬁnding would suggest that progression is nonlinear – possibly exponential – and slower in the posterior putamen
where the disease is more advanced at baseline.
At present, 11C-DTBZ PET is only available in few centres and not
many longitudinal studies have been performed with this technique.
The Vancouver group has reported two separate longitudinal studies
in PD patients over a 4-year follow-up [39,40]. The annual rate of
decline in putamen DTBZ was around 5% of baseline. A faster rate of
progression was observed in patients with a milder disease.
Due to their capacity to monitor the loss of dopaminergic function
in PD objectively and to their relatively wide availability worldwide,

2.4. Involvement of non-dopaminergic pathways in PD
Although the nigrostriatal pathway is the neuronal system most
severely affected in PD, it is now well established that the degenerative
process also targets serotonergic, noradrenergic and cholinergic
neurons. Post-mortem studies have shown involvement of the nucleus
basalis of Meynert, the raphe nuclei and the locus ceruleus [50]. It is,
therefore, likely that Lewy body pathology in the noradrenergic,
serotonergic and cholinergic systems is responsible for the onset of
some non-motor symptoms in PD. Non-motor symptoms, which can
appear even before the onset of the classical motor symptoms, include
hyposomia, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, mood disorders,
psychosis, impaired cognition and dementia.
18
F-dopa PET has been employed to evaluate the distribution and
the function of serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the brain.
As 18F-dopa uptake reﬂects the activity of AADC, which is present in
the terminals of all monoaminergic neurones, measurements of its
uptake into extrastriatal areas provide an index of the density of the
serotonergic and noradrenergic along with dopaminergic terminals.
Our group has recently used 18F-dopa PET in a cross-sectional study to
characterize extrastriatal monoamine neuronal dysfunction in PD.
Interestingly, the midbrain raphe showed raised and the locus
coeruleus normal 18F-dopa uptake in early PD and then levels fell
below normal in advanced patients. Uptake into the red nucleus,
subthalamus, ventral thalamus and pineal gland was also targeted in
more advanced patients, whereas limbic areas, except for hypothalamus, were spared even in late disease [51].
The serotonergic system has also been directly investigated in PD
with several speciﬁc PET and SPECT ligands. Most of these studies
were directed towards evaluating the role of serotonergic function in
PD depression. The DAT ligand 123I-β-CIT binds with lower afﬁnity to
serotonin transporters in the brainstem [52]. Using 123I-β-CIT SPECT,
Kim et al. [53] found no difference in levels of reduction of 123I-β-CIT
binding in the brainstem of PD patients with and without depression.
Additionally, there were no correlations between radiotracer binding
in this region and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores.
11
C-WAY-100635 PET is a marker of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors
which act as autoreceptors on the soma of serotonergic neurones in
the median raphe. A 25% reduction in binding of 11C-WAY-100635 has
been observed in the midbrain raphe of PD patients compared to
healthy controls but the magnitude of reduction was similar whether
depression was present or absent [54]. 11C-DASB PET is a marker of
brain serotonin transporter binding. In advanced, non-depressed PD
patients, Guttman et al. have reported 20–30% reduced binding of
11
C-DASB in all examined brain areas compatible with a modest,
widespread loss of brain serotonergic innervation [55]. The results
from these studies, therefore, do not support a major role for serotonergic loss in PD depression. Interestingly, the severity of resting
tremor in PD has been found to correlate with a decrease in median
raphe 5-HT1A receptor binding, as measured by 11C-WAY 100635 PET
[56]. This observation suggests that midbrain tegmental rather than
nigrostriatal pathology may be more relevant to the pathogenesis of
parkinsonian tremor.
11
C-RT132 is a PET tracer that binds with similar nanomolar afﬁnity
to both dopamine and noradrenaline membrane transporters. This
tracer has recently been used to assess noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in PD patients with depression. Depressed
PD patients showed lower 11C-RT132 binding in locus coeruleus and
areas of the limbic system than non-depressed PD patients. In areas
with low dopaminergic innervation such as locus coeruleus, 11C-RT132
uptake mainly reﬂects the density of noradrenergic neurons. In limbic
areas, such as the ventral striatum and amygdala, 11C-RT132 uptake
reﬂects function of both dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways
[57]. This ﬁnding, therefore, suggests an important role for noradrenaline and limbic dopaminergic rather than serotonergic dysfunction in
the pathogenesis of depression in patients with PD.

PET and SPECT have also been employed to assess the role of
cholinergic deﬁciency in PD patients with dementia. The SPECT tracer
123
I-BMV is an in vivo marker of the vesicular acetylcholine
transporter. Kuhl et al. have reported that PD patients without
dementia showed reduced 123I-BMV uptake in the parietal and
occipital cortex, whereas PD with dementia had a more severe global
reduction of cortical binding similar to that seen in Alzheimer's
disease patients [58]. Hilker et al. have assayed cortical acethylcholinesterase activity in PD with 11C-MP4A PET. They found that
cholinergic function was lost throughout the cortex in parallel with
the loss of striatal dopaminergic function in PD, demented cases
showing the most severe reductions [59]. Cortical acethylcholinesterase activity in PD with and without dementia has also been
investigated with 11C-PMP PET. The greatest reduction in cortical
acetylcholinesterase activity was again found in PD patients with
dementia (PDD). Interestingly, patients with Alzheimer's disease,
despite being matched to PD patients for dementia severity, showed a
lesser reduction in cholinergic innervation to PDD, the lateral
temporal cortex being selectively targeted [60]. This result supports
the usage of acethylcholinesterase inhibitors in PD dementia as well as
Alzheimer's disease.
Finally, PET ligands have recently been developed for imaging
β-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. We
have used 11C-PIB PET, a marker for ﬁbrillar β-amyloid plaques, and
18
F-FDG PET to correlate in vivo regional brain β-amyloid load with
glucose metabolism in seven PD patients with later onset dementia
[61]. None of these seven PDD patients showed any increase in 11C-PIB
uptake despite the presence of signiﬁcantly reduced glucose metabolism in frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital association areas. These
ﬁndings suggest that β-amyloid deposition does not contribute
signiﬁcantly to the pathogenesis of later onset dementia in PD.
2.5. Neuroinﬂammation in PD
11

C-(R)-PK11195 PET is a marker of microglial activation, the
natural immune defence to brain injury. Two recent papers have
reported signiﬁcantly increases in 11C-(R)-PK11195 binding in both
striatal and extrastriatal regions in PD patients compared to normal
controls, suggesting increased levels of activated microglia in this
condition [62,63]. Ouchi et al. reported a correlation between
midbrain tracer uptake and reduced striatal DAT binding supporting
the hypothesis that neuroinﬂammatory responses by activated
microglia may contribute to dopamine neurone loss in PD [62].
3. Magnetic resonance imaging
MRI is far more widely available than PET and SPECT and is most
commonly used in clinical practice to differentiate idiopathic PD from
secondary causes of parkinsonism, such as vascular disease and other
structural lesions. MRI ﬁndings may also help differentiate PD from
multiple system atrophy by showing a reduced T2-weighted Putman
signal, and progressive supranuclear palsy and cortical-basal degeneration by revealing midbrain and cortical atrophy [64]. There is an
abundance of papers published on this topic, but they are beyond the
scope of the current review and will not be discussed here further.
Conventional MRI is normal in patients with idiopathic PD without
dementia, as standard MRI sequences have proved unable to detect
deﬁnitive abnormalities in the basal ganglia structures. Several
researchers have used MRI sequences designed to reveal changes in
midbrain iron content as post-mortem studies in PD have shown an
increase in iron concentration in the SN [65]. Early MRI studies failed
to show signiﬁcant differences in SN iron levels between PD patients
and controls [66,67]. New MRI methodologies, however, appear to be
more sensitive to iron increases in PD patients [68–71]. Using
inversion recovery white and grey matter signal-suppression
sequences, structural changes have been found in the SN of PD

N. Pavese, D.J. Brooks / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1792 (2009) 722–729

patients, even at very early stages, with signiﬁcant differences
between patients and control group [68,69]. In one of these studies,
MRI changes within the SN of PD patients correlated with a striatal
dopaminergic function measured by 18F-dopa PET. 18F-dopa PET,
however, was more reliable than inversion recovery MRI in discriminating patients with moderately severe PD from normal subjects [69].
Recently, Martin et al. [71] have assessed 26 untreated PD patients
with a 3 T MRI and a multiple gradient echo sequence designed for
rapid single-scan mapping of the proton transverse relaxation rate
(R2⁎). They found that PD patients had signiﬁcantly higher R2⁎ values
in the lateral SNc compared to controls. Interestingly, there was an
association between the lateralized motor score from the clinically
most affected side and R2⁎ values obtained from the opposite lateral
SNc. Longitudinal studies are currently underway to assess the validity
of nigral R2⁎ measurements as a marker of disease duration.
Voxel based morphometry (VBM) [72] is an MRI technique that
localises signiﬁcant changes in grey matter density related to disease.
MR images are spatially normalized into standard stereotaxic space,
segmented into gray and white matter and cerebrospinal ﬂuid,
smoothed and submitted to statistical parametric mapping at a
voxel level. VBM has been used in PD to evaluate patterns of brain
atrophy in patients with and without dementia [73–77]. These studies
have revealed signiﬁcant cortical atrophy in PD patients with
dementia which progresses over time. Feldmann et al. [78] have
recently reported VBM ﬁndings in a group of PD patients with and
without depression. They found gray matter decrease in the bilateral
orbitrofrontal cortex, the right superior temporal pole, and the limbic
system of depressed PD patients.
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion tensor tractography
(DTT) are promising new MRI techniques which evaluate the integrity
of tracts in white matter and, indirectly, neuronal connectivity in the
brain. Normally water diffusion is constrained along nerve ﬁbres in
brain tissue and so is anisotropic. Degeneration of tracts leads to the
loss of this directionality of diffusion or anisotropy. DTI measures the
direction and magnitude of diffusivity of water molecules in tissues
and can be used as an index of damage to neuronal tracts. There are
two main quantities of interest: the mean apparent diffusion
coefﬁcient (ADC), which measures total molecular motion averaged
over all directions, and fractional anisotropy (FA), which is a measure
of the directional diffusivity of water. DTT is a computational
procedure that reconstructs major ﬁber bundles in the brain based
on the anisotropy of water movement in myelinated white matter.
Yoshikawa et al. [79] and Chan et al. [80] have reported lower values of
FA in the SN of PD patients compared to controls. FA values were
inversely correlated with disease severity [80]. Another study has
shown evidence of olfactory tract degeneration in early PD patients
[81]. This ﬁnding is in line with the 50% prevalence of hyposmia in PD
on UPSIT testing and gives support to the staging procedure proposed
by Braak. Finally, DTI has been used to investigate non-motor
symptoms of PD. Matsui et al. scanned a group of PD patients with
and without depression and found bilateral abnormalities in the
anterior cingulate in depressed patients [82]. The same group also
compared PD patients with and without dementia and found
abnormalities in the posterior cingulate in the latter [83]. These
interesting ﬁndings remain to be conﬁrmed by larger studies.
4. Transcranial sonography
Transcranial brain sonography (TCS) is a neuroimaging technique
which measures brain tissue echogenicity through the intact skull. TCS
is usually performed using a phase-array ultrasound system with a
2.5 Mhz transducer. The butterﬂy-shaped mesencephalon can be
identiﬁed through a preauricular acoustic bone window in most
subjects.
The typical TCS ﬁnding in PD patients is an increased echogenicity
from the lateral midbrain, probably arising from the SN and

727

reﬂecting increased amounts of iron deposition. The SN, which in
normal subjects appear as a small patchy area of slightly increased
echogenicity, become more demarcated and identiﬁable in PD
patients. SN hyperechogenicity has been reported in up to 90% of
clinically probable PD patients assessed with this technique [84–86].
A similar ﬁnding, however, has also been reported in 17% of patients
with essential tremor [87], 40% of depressed patients without signs
of PD [88], and in 10% of healthy age-matched volunteers where it
could possibly reﬂect subclinical involvement of the nigrostriatal
system [89,90]. Conversely, normal SN echogenicity is observed in
atypical parkinsonian syndromes despite involvement of the dopaminergic system and this may help in the differential diagnosis with
PD [91]. Levels of nigral echogenicity in PD do not correlate with
striatal dopamine transporter binding measured with 123I-FP-CIT
SPECT [92] and do not appear to change over a ﬁve-year follow-up
period despite clinical progression [93]. This suggests that SN
hyperechogenicity is a trait rather than state marker of PD, probably
reﬂecting disturbances of iron metabolism rather than neuronal
degeneration.
5. Future perspectives
Neuroprotection remains an open challenge in PD research and it is
expected that in the near future novel putative neuroprotective agents
will become available which will need to be tested. Current imaging
biomarkers have generally proved to be a valuable adjunct to clinical
data when assessing both mechanism and efﬁcacy of neuroprotective
agents but they have also shown on occasion a discordance with
clinical outcome. Further research should aim to determine direct
drug effects on the imaging biomarkers currently available but also to
develop new imaging techniques to longitudinally monitor progression and treatment of PD. Development of new radiotracers to target
non-dopaminergic brain pathways and the glial reaction to disease is
also needed. A better understanding of the involvement of nondopaminergic structures in PD could potentially provide insight into
non-motor symptoms experienced by subgroups of patients and
hopefully rationalise the therapeutic options for the management of
these disabling complications.
