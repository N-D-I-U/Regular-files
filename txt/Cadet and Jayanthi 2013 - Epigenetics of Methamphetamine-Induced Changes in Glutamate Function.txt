Rolling the Dice:
The Importance of
Mesolimbic Dopamine
Signaling in Risky
Decision Making
To maximize resources, organisms must
learn to predict the outcome of various
options and choose the most valuable
alternative. Behavioral choices such as
‘playing it safe’ vs ‘taking a risk’ engage a
complex circuit that includes the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system. A seminal study by Schultz et al (1997) showed
that mesolimbic DA neurons function as
a ‘teaching signal’ and encode cues that
predict rewards and errors in those
predictions. DA release in the nucleus
accumbens (NAc) reflects this learning
signal, and also processes information
about reward value as animals are
actively making decisions. For example,
DA release in the NAc core is higher for
cues that predict more valuable rewards,
and signals the most valuable available
option (Day et al, 2010).
Organisms rarely encounter situations in which simple stimulus-outcome associations are in effect, and
thus must rely on multiple factors to
make appropriate decisions including
the representations of internal needs
and external states, possible courses of
action, and the consequences of those
actions (Rangel et al, 2008). Risky
decision making involves this type of
complex evaluation and is of particular interest because it is implicated in
several psychiatric disorders, including gambling and drug addiction.
Risk-taking behavior has been modeled in rats using a task where subjects
are allowed to choose between larger
more uncertain rewards or smaller
certain rewards. Importantly, in this
task, it is not more advantageous to
make one response over the other,
and as such it is possible to evaluate
intrinsic subjective value and individual risk attitudes. We have found
that DA release in the NAc encodes
the subjective value of future outcomes and, when given a free choice,
may bias animals toward a risk or safe
preference (Sugam et al, 2012).

However, the mesolimbic DA-NAc
system does not function in isolation.
Disruptions of the basolateral amygdala
(BLA), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and NAc
circuitry have resulted in differential
effects on risk-taking. The BLA-NAc
circuit appears critical for encoding
reward probabilities, thus biasing animals to more valuable options when
risks are lower. The PFC appears
critical for tracking reward omissions
and is important for shifting behavior
as rewards become more uncertain and
less valuable (St Onge et al, 2012).
These findings suggest that each discrete region in this larger circuit has
different roles in mediating appropriate
decision making, and signaling from
these structures likely modulate the
value signaling of the mesolimbic DA
system in risky decision making.
Recent advances in optogenetic
techniques allow for the probing of
individual portions of the reward
circuit in mediating risk-taking behavior. For example, using a genetic
line of rats, researchers were able to
selectively activate DA fibers arising
from the ventral tegmental area and
showed that this manipulation is
sufficient to drive motivated behaviors (Witten et al, 2011). Thus, future
studies can apply optogenetic tools
to selectively manipulate DA signaling
while rats are deciding to engage in
risk-taking behavior, and examine
the causal relationship between rapid
DA signaling in each discrete region
of the mesolimbic circuit and risky
behaviors. Determining the mechanisms that underlie appropriate risktaking behavior will not only enhance
our understanding of the role of this
circuitry in normal decision making,
but will also provide insight into
what goes wrong during maladaptive
risk taking. This approach may help
identify optimal targets for therapeutic treatments of maladaptive decision making that occur, for example,
in drug or gambling addiction or in
eating disorders.

Epigenetics of
MethamphetamineInduced Changes in
Glutamate Function
Addiction to methamphetamine (METH)
is a relapsing neuropsychiatric disorder
that is secondary, in part, to functional
changes in limbic and striatal brain
regions (reviewed in Krasnova and
Cadet (2009)). Stimulant-induced plastic
changes within the striatum are dependent on a series of events that include
modifications in the number and
subtypes of glutamate receptors (Wolf
and Ferrario, 2010). Elucidating the
basic mechanisms that maintain METH
addiction is important because such an
understanding will probably lead to the
development of efficacious treatments.
The accumulated evidence supports the
notion that illicit drugs exert substantial
transcriptional and epigenetic changes in
the brain (Robison and Nestler, 2011).

tin, with resulting H4K16ac hypoacetylation and decreased H4K16ac
binding onto GluA1 and GluA2 DNA
sequences. In addition, a METH-induced MeCP2-CoREST-HDAC2 complex might preferentially be involved
in the hypoacetylation of histone H4
at lysines 5 and 12. The present observations add to the accumulating evidence that psychostimulants can cause
substantial transcriptional and epigenetic changes in the brain. These
results also suggest that therapeutic
approaches that involved the use of
epigenetic agents might be important
areas for future investigations.
Figure 1. Models illustrating METH-induced epigenetic modifications in the dorsal striatum. Under
normal conditions, a balance exists between histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone
deacetylases (HDACs) that regulate the histone acetylation/deacetylation status that control the
mRNA expression of AMPA receptor subunits (a). Chronic METH exposure (b) increases the
expression of HDAC2, SIRT2, CoREST, and MeCP2. This is followed by the formation of protein
repressor complexes that cause histone H4 hypoacetylation. Histone H4 hypoacetylation
then produces decreased expression of GluA1 and GuA2 in the dorsal striatum of chronically
METH-exposed rats.

Gene transcription is regulated by
complex epigenetic changes that include
post-translational histone modifications
and DNA methylation (Mehler, 2008).
There is evidence that epigenetic
phenomena are intimately involved
in the development and the clinical
course of complex neuropsychiatric
diseases including addiction (Robison
and Nestler, 2011). Therefore, we
thought it likely that METH might
engender transcriptional and epigenetic alterations that are unique to
this clinically devastating drug.
As a first step toward clarifying
the effects of METH on glutamatergic
function, we treated rats with an escalating METH dose paradigm that
started at METH (0.5 mg/kg twice/
day) and ended with METH (3 mg/kg
four times per day) over a period of
2 weeks (McCoy et al, 2011). We found
that chronic METH caused significant
decreases in mRNA and protein levels
of both GluA1 and GluA2 AMPA
receptor subunits. We also found that
METH caused significant decreases in
acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 5
(H4K5), lysine 12 (H4K12), and lysine
16 (H4K16). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation-PCR assay, we found
that repeated METH injections pro-

duced decreased binding of acetylated
H4K5, H4K12, and H4K16 on GluA1
and GluA2 DNA sequences. In addition,
chronic METH administration enhanced the recruitment of corepressor of
RE1 silencing transcription (CoREST)
factor onto GluA1 and GluA2 DNA
sequences. METH also caused CoREST
co-immunoprecipitation with histone
deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and sirtuin 2
(SIRT2). Moreover, METH increased
enrichment of methyl CpG binding
protein 2 (MeCP2) on the promoters
of both GluA1 and GluA2, with coimmunoprecipitation studies revealing
METH-induced MeCP2 interactions
with HDAC2. Finally, we demonstrated
that the FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid, prevented METHinduced downregulation of GluA1 and
GluA2 mRNA levels.
In summary, the present study
provides direct evidence for epigenetic
regulation of chronic transcriptional
effects of METH in the dorsal striatum. Figure 1 provides a scheme
that describes a potential role of
CoREST, HDAC2, MeCP2, and SIRT2
in the mediation of METH-induced
downregulation of GluA1 and GluA2
mRNA levels. Specifically, CoREST
might recruit SIRT2 onto the chroma-
