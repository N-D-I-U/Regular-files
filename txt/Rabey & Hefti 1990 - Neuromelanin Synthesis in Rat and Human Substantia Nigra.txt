Summary. A relation between neuromelanin synthesis and vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons is suggested by the fact that heavily pigmented cells are
preferentially lost in aging and Parkinson's disease and that the dopaminergic
neurotoxin M P P + (1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridine) binds to neuromelanin. To
elucidate the mechanism of neuromelanin synthesis, we studied the formation
of melanin in homogenates of human and rat substantia nigra tissue "in vitro".
It was found that enzymatic processes accounted for 70% and 90% of the
melanin formation in homogenates of human and rat tissue, respectively. The
enzymatic synthesis was due to the activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO),
since it was prevented by selective inhibitors of this enzyme. Both MPTP (1methyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and M P P + inhibited melanin formation, probably due to their ability to inhibit MAO. No evidence was found
for involvement of cytochrome P-450 monooxigenases, which have been postulated to exist in central catecholaminergic neurons. Proadifen reduced melanin
formation, not necessarily because it is an inhibitor of P-450 monooxigenases,
but rather as it is also a potent inhibitor of MAO. Some antioxidants like
ascorbic acid, but not agents destroying hydrogen peroxide, inhibited melanin
formation. The findings suggest that the formation of neuromelanin in the
substantia nigra involves MAO and non-enzymatic oxidative processes.
Keywords: MPTP, MPP +, neuromelanin, Parkinson's disease.
Introduction
Neuromelanin, a complex polymer bound to lipofuscin granules is found in
human and other mammalian brains where it is located in catecholaminergic
neurons in the substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and other brain stem nuclei
(Bazelon et al., 1967; Bogerts, 1981; Lillie, 1957; Marsden, 1983). Cytophotometric studies have shown a linear increase in the pigmentation of catecholaminergic neurons with age until the seventh decade (Mann and Yates, 1974;

2

J.M. Rabey and F. Hefti

Mann and Yates, 1977). After this time the mean neuromelanin density of
individual neurons diminishes. The heavily pigmented neurons are preferentially
lost, suggesting a relationship between synthesis or accumulation of neuromelanin and cell degeneration (Mann and Yates, 1983; Hirsch et al., 1988).
Several studies have shown that dopa, dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin serve as a substrate for neuromelanin synthesis. This is thought to
proceed by polymerization of oxidated products via indole quinone intermediates (Barden, 1969; Das et al., 1978; Graham, 1978; Graham, 1979; Rodgers
and Curzon, 1975; Van Woert et al., 1967). This pathway appears to be an
alternative route for metabolism of catecholamines besides the well described
pathways involving oxidative deamination (catalyzed by monoamine oxidase,
MAO) and o-methylation (catalyzed by catechol-o-methyl transferase). Besides
resulting in the accumulation of neuromelanin, oxidation of catecholamines is
likely to produce potentially toxic products such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals (Graham, 1978a, b). The quinone intermediates themselves react with sulfhydryl groups and are inhibitors of enzymes
with cysteinyl residues at or near active sites (Graham et al., 1977; Tiffany et
al., 1978).
The exact mechanism of neuromelanin formation is still controversial. Previous studies suggest that neuromelanin formation is catalyzed enzymatically,
particularly by MAO (Fellman, 1958; Van Woert et al., 1967). On the contrary,
Rodgers and Curzon (1975) denied any participation of MAO enzymes in
neuromelanin synthesis, and suggested that the process occurs spontaneously.
Given the fact that neuromelanin containing ceils degenerate selectively in
Parkinson's disease (Hirsch et al., 1988) and that neuromelanin is abundant in
humans and other primates but not in rat substantia nigra, we decided to further
study the "in vitro" synthesis of neuromelanin in tissue from both species. Due
to the above mentioned conflictual data, in order to elucidicate the role of
MAO in the process of neuromelanin synthesis we measured melanin formation
in substantia nigra in the presence of specific MAO inhibitors.
Recently, NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase was seen in central catecholaminergic neurons, suggesting the presence of cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases within these cells (Haglund et al., 1984). It was speculated that cytochrome P-450 participates in the metabolism of catecholamines and that it may
be responsible for the formation of toxic products derived from them. In the
present study the possibility that cytochrome P-450 monooxigenases participate
in the synthesis of neuromelanin was tested.
Recent studies have suggested an involvement of neuromelanin in the neurotoxic action of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (D'Amato et al., 1986; Lyden et al., 1983; Wu et al., 1986). It has been shown that
MPTP and MPP + bind to synthetic melanin formed by polymerization of
dopamine and norepinephrine, as well as to neuromelanin extracted from the
substantia nigra of monkeys. On the basis of these studies it has been proposed
(Snyder and D'Amato, 1986) that melanin may form a depot for MPP + within

dopaminergic neurons, permitting its retention and consequent gradual release.
Although binding properties of MPTP and MPP + to melanin have been described their influence on melanin synthesis has not been studied. This question
was addressed in the present report. Furthermore, in an attempt to overcome
the "cascade" of oxidative reactins occurring in the synthesis of neuromelanin
we studied melanin formation in the presence of the antioxidants, ascorbic acid
and hydrazine.
Methods

Materials
Proadifen was a gift from Smith Kline and French Laboratories, Philadelphia, Deprenyl
a gift of Dr. Heikkila (Rutgers Medical School, Piscataway N.J.). Clorgyline, MPTP and
MPP + were purchased from Research Biochemicals Inc.; ascorbic acid and hydrogen
peroxide were obtained from Mallinckrodt Inc., St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.A. All other
chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemicals Co., St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.A. Human
midbrain tissue containing the substantia nigra was dissected from two neurologically
normal subjects. The tissue was obtained 10-12 h after death and was stored at - 7 0 ~
The rat midbrain area containing substantia nigra was dissected from Wistar rats (250300 g) killed by decapitation.

Assay of melanin synthesis
Pooled material from human and rats (separately) was used for the experiments. Tissue
was homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4 using a
glass-teflon homogenator. Fifty gl of the homogenate were incubated at 37 ~ with 10 gl
of a solution containing 0.1 gmol of [-7-~4CJdopamine (1.1 mCi/mmol). Standard incubation
time was 5 h. Blanks consisted of homogenates incubated with labelled dopamine and kept
for 5 h at 0 ~ (No difference was observed between homogenates kept at 0 ~ for 5 h or
homogenates processed immediately after addition of labelled dopamine.) The reaction was
stopped by the addition of 100 gl of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The mixture
was then filtered through a membrane filter (Milliposte type AA, pore size 0.8 ~tm). The
filters were washed sequentially with 5% TCA, H20 , 0.1 M HC1 and H20. Filters were
then put in scintillation vials and counted using Scintrex liquid scintillation cocktail for
samples on solid supports (J. T. Baker) in a 1,211 LKB counter. Drugs used in the assay
were dissolved in H20 and added to the incubation medium. The final volume of each
sample was 100 ~tl. Samples were run in triplicate. Results were expressed as nmoles dopamine incorporated per hour, and mg protein [determined according to Bradford (1976)].

Assay of MAO activity
A modification of the method of Roth and Feor (1978) was used. Two hundred gl of brain
homogenate were incubated with 200 ~tl incubation solution containing 50 nmol ascorbic
acid and 40nmol of [7-~4C]dopamine (1.6mCi/mmol) for 60min at 37 ~ The reaction
was stopped by adding 150 gl of 0.4 M perchloric acid. After removal of the precipitated
proteins by centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on small columns of Dowex-50 W
(50X8-200). Columns were prepared in Pasteur pipets and were equilibrated with 0.1 M
HC1. Deaminated dopamine was eluted with 2 ml of H20 and the effluent was collected
in scintillation vials and counted with 15ml of Quantafluor (Mallinckrodt).

Results

Measurement of melanin synthesis
The assay used in this study measures the incorporation of 14C-dopamine into
TCA-precipitable polymers during incubation with homogenates of substantia
nigra tissue. The following points justify the fact that this parameter reflects
the formation of melanin. First, neuromelanin isolated from human substantia
nigra has similar properties to melanin formed in vitro from dopamine (Das
et al., 1978; Van Woert et al., 1967). Second, using an assay similar to ours,
Rodgers and Curzon (1975) showed earlier that incorporation of dopamine
into TCA-precipitable polymers parallels the increase in absorbance and is
dependent on the presence of oxygen. Third, these authors ruled out that
dopamine is incorporated into proteins by showing that dopamine-containing
polymers are not degraded when heated in the presence of 6M HC1. The
concentration of dopamine used in our assay (1 raM) was based on estimations
of dopamine concentration in the cytoplasm of dopaminergic cells (Lichtensteiger, 1971; Lichtensteiger et al., 1976, 1979). The assay was linear with regard
to time and concentration of homogenate in the range used in our studies
(Fig. 1).

Non-enzymatic melanin synthesis
Boiling of homogenates (100 ~ for 30 rain) reduced melanin formation in human
and rat substantia nigra homogenates to 29% and 9% of control values, respectively (Table 1). This species-related difference was a consistent finding
observed in all experiments and represented the only significant difference between rat and human tissue.

Involvement of cytochrome P-450 monooxigenases
A d d i t i o n of N A D P H and MgC12, which are necessary cofactors of cytochrome
P-450 (Mayer et al., 1980) to the incubation medium, failed to stimulate melanin
f o r m a t i o n (Table 1). The presence of N A D P H was even inhibitory, probably
due to the antioxidant properties of this c o m p o u n d . Proadifen, an inhibitor of
c y t o c h r o m e P-450 m o n o o x i g e n a s e (Mayer et al., 1980) reduced melanin formation. The ICs0 of this process was 0.9 m M (Fig. 2). However, since melanin
f o r m a t i o n was also inhibited by M A O inhibitors (see below), we tested for the
possibility that proadifen inhibits the deamination of d o p a m i n e by M A O . Indeed, proadifen was f o u n d to inhibit M A O activity with an ICs0 of 0 . 2 m M
(Fig. 2). F u r t h e r m o r e , proadifen added together with an inhibitor of M A O pargyline, failed to reduce melanin f o r m a t i o n to levels lower t h a n those measured in the presence ofpargyline alone (Table 1). These findings strongly suggest

independent experiments. ICs0 values for the inhibition of melanin synthesis and MAO
activity by proadifen were 0.86mM and 0.20mM respectively

that the reduction of melanin formation mediated by proadifen was due to the
ability of this compound to inhibit MAO, and not by inhibiting the P450
monooxigenases.

Effect of MAO inhibitors, MPTP and MPP +
Melanin synthesis was inhibited by the MAO inhibitors deprenyl, clorgyline
and pargyline in both human and rat substantia nigra homogenates, indicating
that MAO is involved in the formation of melanin (Table 1). Maximal inhibition
produced by MAO inhibitors reduced melanin formation to 30-40% of control
values. Maximal inhibition was observed with pargyline, an inhibitor of both
MAO-A and MAO-B (Heikkila et al., 1984) and with the combination of
clorgyline and deprenyl, specific inhibitors of MAO-A and MAO-B respectively
(Heikkila et al., 1984; Knoll, 1983). When used alone, clorgyline and deprenyl
produced intermediate inhibitions. The addition of MPTP or MPP +, which
are both inhibitors of MAO (Bochetta et al., 1985; Del Zompo et al., 1986;
Heikkila et al., 1984; Parsons and Rainbow, 1984; Singer et al., 1985) also
produced a marked inhibition in melanin synthesis in homogenates of both
species (Table 1). The addition of MAO inhibitors MPTP or MPP + did not
affect non-enzymatic melanin formation occurring in boiled tissue homogenates.

Effect of hydrogen peroxide, catalyse, ascorbic acid, and hydrazine
MAO might stimulate melanin formation by providing deaminated dopamine
metabolites which are incorporated into melanin. An alternative possibility is
that hydrogen peroxide formed as a by-product of MAO-catalyzed deamination,

may promote the oxidation of dopamine. To test for this latter possibility,
reagents which alter the concentration of hydrogen peroxide were included in
the incubation medium. The addition of hydrogen peroxide produced modest
increases in melanin formation (Table 2). Catalase, which inhibits hydrogen
peroxide formation, failed to significantly inhibit melanin formation and did
not reduce melanin formation below values measured when M A O was maximally inhibited. These findings fail to support the concept that hydrogen peroxide is involved in the formation of melanin in vitro.
Melanin formation in native and boiled homogenates was strongly inhibited
by the addition of ascorbic acid, a strong well k n o w n antioxidant. Hydrazine,
another antioxidant, was ineffective (Table 2).

Discussion
Despite the fact that the selective loss of melanin-containing neurons in Parkinson's disease has been k n o w n for m a n y years, the mechanism of neuromelanin synthesis is still poorly understood. Neuromelanin synthesis in the
brain clearly differs from the synthesis of melanin as it occurs in pigmented

8

cells outside of the CNS. Synthesis of peripheral melanin which is catalyzed by
the enzyme tyrosinase uses tyrosine or L-dopa as a substrate (Barden, 1969;
Graham, 1979; Marsden, 1983; Prota, 1980; Rodgers and Curzon, 1975). The
evidence that neuromelanin synthesis in the CNS does not involve tyrosinase
includes the following points. First, homogenates of human and monkey substantia nigra tissue fail to oxidize tyrosine to melanin (Barden, 1969; Rodgers
and Curzon, 1975). Second, the substantia nigra has been found to be pigmented
in human albinos who lacked all peripheral tyrosinase (Foley and Baxter, 1958).
Third, the addition of cyanide, which inhibits tyrosinase, does not affect neuromelanin synthesis (Pomerantz, 1958; Prota, 1980). Fourth, chemical characterization of neuromelanin revealed that its synthesis starts from L-dopa or
other catecholamines rather than from tyrosine (Das et al., 1978; Van Woert
et al., 1967).

Non-enzymatic synthesis of neuromelanin
Rodgers and Curzon (1975) showed that melanin formation still occurred "approximately in the same amount" after heat inactivation of enzymes present in
homogenate of human substantia nigra (100~ for 30rain). On the basis of
these findings, they concluded that "enzyme activity may play little direct part
in melanin synthesis by brain tissue in vitro". In our study, homogenates of
human substantia nigra denatured by heating, (the same procedure) synthesized
approximately 30% of melanin when compared with untreated homogenates.
Homogenates of rat substantia nigra denatured by boiling were able to form
only 5-10% of melanin when compared with intact tissue. The discrepancy
between our findings and those of Rodgers and Curzon is probably due to the
fact the Rodgers and Curzon excluded the participation of MAO by adding
inhibitors to their assay (see below). The reason for the difference in rates of
non-enzymatic synthesis between rat and human tissue found in our study
remains unexplained. This difference may be partly responsible for the difference
in pigmentation between rat and human dopaminergic neurons (DeMattei et
al., 1986; Marsden, 1983). Recently, a peroxidase which oxidizes dopamine has
been isolated from canine brainstem (Grisham et al., 1987). This peroxidase
might be present in other species and may be responsible for the enzymatic
melanin formation in rat homogenates, not ascribed to the catalytic activity of
MAO (Table 1).

Involvement of MAO
The possibility of MAO playing a role in neuromelanin synthesis was proposed
by Fellman (1958) and Van Woert (1967) based on their finding that melanin
is formed during the incubation of amines with MAO from liver mitochondria.
Rodgers and Curzon (1975) concluded that enzymes play a small role in neuromelanin synthesis in vitro, however, they rather arbitrarily excluded the participation of MAO by the addition of tranylcypromine (a non specific MAO

Neuromelanin synthesis in rat and human substantia nigra

inhibitor) in all their measurements. Their data show that this MAO inhibitor
reduced melanin formation to a small extent in the substantia nigra but by up
to 50% in various other brain areas. In our study, combined inhibition of MAOA and MAO-B (produced by pargyline or by the combined administration of
deprenyl and clorgyline) inhibited neuromelanin formation by 60-70% (see
Table 1). As we homogenized the tissue before incubation, dopamine contained
in substantia nigra cells might have been exposed to both types of MAO, which
are normally present in the region (Rainbow et al., 1985; Westlund et al., 1985).
In vivo, intraneuronal dopamine might have access to MAO-A only, since,
using immunohistochemical methods, only this form of the enzyme has been
found to be located within dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra (Westlund
et al., 1985).
MAO might catalyze the formation of neuromelanin by at least two separate
mechanisms. First, it may act directly by providing dopamine metabolites incorporated into neuromelanin. There is presently no evidence supporting this
concept, however a "novel" catalytic function of MAO other than its well
characterized deamination of monoamines has recently been found. The pyridine ring of MPTP is converted by MAO to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridine (MPDP), which is then further oxidated to MPP + (Cohen et al., 1985;
Heikkila et al., 1984). As a second possibility MAO might stimulate NM formation indirectly by producing reactive by-products like hydrogen peroxide
which then catalyzes the auto-oxidation of DA (Kopin et al., 1986; Maker et
al., 1981). We failed to find evidence in support of this concept since the addition
of catalase, which destroys newly formed hydrogen peroxide, did not reduce
melanin formation in our assays. Our findings are in line with those of an
earlier study in which catalase failed to reduce the formation of melanin catalyzed by liver extracts (Blashko and Hellmann, 1953). The concept of another
alternative, as yet undescribed mechanism of interaction, could be possible.

Involvement of cytochrome P-450 monooxigenases
Using immunohistochemical procedures, the enzyme NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase was seen in central catecholaminergic neurons (Haglund et al.,
1984). This finding suggests that cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases are located
within catecholaminergic neurons. It was speculated that these enzymes are
involved in the metabolism of catecholamines and may be responsible for the
formation of toxic products. In the present study, the possibility that cytochrome
P-450 monooxigenases participate in the synthesis of neuromelanin was tested.
We failed to obtain evidence supporting this hypothesis, since the addition of
NADPH and MgC12, which are necessary cofactors of cytochrome P-450 (Mayer
et al., 1980) did not facilitate the reaction. Proadifen, which is known to inhibit
cytochrome P-450 monooxigenase (Mayer et al., 1980) reduced melanin formation. However, it was found to also be an effective inhibitor of MAO,
suggesting that the reduction of melanin formation in our assay was probably

10

J.M. Rabey and F. Hefti

due to its ability to inhibit MAO. This property of proadifen may be responsible
for the potentiation of MPTP toxicity on hepatocytes, which has been ascribed
to cytochrome P-450 inhibition (Smith et al., 1987).

Interaction of MPTP and MPP + with melanin formation
Both MPTP and MPP + were found to inhibit the synthesis of melanin in vitro
(Table 1). The interference of these compounds may have occurred by interaction
with MAO activity, since recent studies have shown that both these neurotoxic
drugs can inhibit this enzyme (Heikkila et al., 1984; Singer et al., 1985). It seems
unlikely that MPTP and MPP + interfere with the non-enzymatic oxidation of
dopamine, since they failed to affect melanin formation from dopamine incubated without tissue extracts (data not shown).
One of the theories concerning the toxic effect of MPTP postulates that its
action is due to increased oxidation of dopamine with the production of superoxides and other cytotoxic free radicals in a quantity that exceeds the neutralizing capacity of the natural cellular protective enzymes and reducing substances (Fuller et al., 1985; Parsons and Rainbow, 1984). However, the toxicity
of MPTP to dopaminergic neurons in vivo is not affected by treatments that
affect intracellular dopamine levels (Melamed et al., 1985; Schmidt et al., 1985).
The lack of interaction of MPTP and MPP + with the non-enzymatic melanin
synthesis, as observed in our study, sustains this notion.

Relation of neuromelanin synthesis to dopaminergic cell toxicity
The number of pigmented nerve cells in human substantia nigra and locus
coeruleus declines during aging. The melanin content of the remaining cells in
the elderly also declines, indicating that neurons with the highest content of
neuromelanin are preferentially lost (Mann and Yates, 1974, 1977, 1983). In
Parkinson's disease there is a greater reduction in the amount of melanin,
because of the severe loss of the heavier pigmented cells (Hirsch et al., 1988;
Mann and Yates, 1983). These findings suggest that synthesis or accumulation
of neuromelanin has deleterious consequences on the cells. Indeed, Mann and
Yates (1977) demonstrated that the accumulation of neuromelanin is accompanied first by a reduction in cytoplasmic RNA content and finally by a decrease
in nucleolar volume in substantia nigra neurons. These authors proposed a
mechanical disruption of the microanatomy of intracellular membranes by
neuromelanin as the mechanism mediating its toxicity. Other authors (Graham,
1979) have postulated that catecholamine neurons may degenerate as the result
of lifelong injury from the by-products of catecholamine oxidation. Findings
indicating that dopamine is much more cytotoxic than norepinephrine or epinephrine support this concept. Dopamine oxidation of the o-quinone derivative
occurs more rapidly and the o-quinone derivative formed cyclyzes more slowly
as compared to norepinephrine, and therefore is more likely to react with
cisteinyl residues of enzymes and membranes (Graham, 1979).

If the synthesis of n e u r o m e l a n i n is deleterious to the cells because of production of oxidative products, the addition of p o t e n t biological antioxidants
like ascorbic acid m a y have protective effects (Wagner et al., 1986). Ascorbic
acid was a very effective inhibitor of melanin synthesis in our studies, b o t h in
the presence and absence of tissue homogenates. In contrast, hydrazine, an
ingredient of cigarette smoke, p r o p o s e d to be an effective antioxidant (Yong
et al., 1986) failed to inhibit melanin synthesis. We do n o t k n o w the cause of
these different effects a m o n g b o t h drugs. A l t h o u g h the rationale seems obvious
for applying antioxidants to dopaminergic cells to avoid toxic deleterious effects
of intrinsic or extrinsic c o m p o u n d s , antioxidants m a y also interfere with a system
removing "waste" products of catecholamine metabolism. Such a treatment
m a y have negative consequences on the integrity of dopaminergic neurons.
Therefore, beneficial effects of antioxidants should be clearly d e m o n s t r a t e d in
animals before such c o m p o u n d s are administered in an indiscriminate way to
h u m a n s , as has been p r o p o s e d recently (Perry et al., 1985).
