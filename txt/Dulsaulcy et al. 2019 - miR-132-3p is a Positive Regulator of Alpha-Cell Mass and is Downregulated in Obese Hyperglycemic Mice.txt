ABSTRACT
Objective: Diabetes is a complex disease implicating several organs and cell types. Within the islets, dysregulation occurs in both alpha- and
beta-cells, leading to defects of insulin secretion and increased glucagon secretion. Dysregulation of alpha-cells is associated with transcriptome
changes. We hypothesized that microRNAs (miRNAs) which are negative regulators of mRNA stability and translation could be involved in alphacell alterations or adaptations during type 2 diabetes.
Methods: miRNA microarray analyses were performed on pure alpha- and beta-cells from high-fat diet fed obese hyperglycemic mice and lowfat diet fed controls. Then, the most regulated miRNA was overexpressed or inhibited in primary culture of mouse and human alpha-cells to
determine its molecular and functional impact.
Results: 16 miRNAs were signiﬁcantly regulated in alpha-cells of obese hyperglycemic mice and 28 in beta-cells. miR-132-3p had the strongest
regulation level in alpha-cells, where it was downregulated, while we observed an opposite upregulation in beta-cells. In vitro experiments
showed that miR-132-3p, which is inversely regulated by somatostatin and cAMP, is a positive modulator of alpha-cell proliferation and
implicated in their resistance to apoptosis. These effects are associated with the regulation of a series of genes, including proliferation and stress
markers Mki67 and Bbc3 in mouse and human alpha-cells, potentially involved in miR-132-3p functions.
Conclusions: Downregulation of miR-132-3p in alpha-cells of obese diabetic mice may constitute a compensatory mechanism contributing to
keep glucagon-producing cell number constant in diabetes.

1. INTRODUCTION
The control of glycemia depends largely on the coordinated secretions
of glucagon and insulin by pancreatic alpha- and beta-cells. Hyperglycemia results when insulin-resistance is accompanied by
dysfunction of pancreatic islet cells. The disrupted coordination of
glucagon and insulin secretions observed in type 2 diabetes is characterized by impaired and delayed insulin secretion as well as basal
hyperglucagonemia and non-suppressed glucagon secretion in
response to glucose [1e3].
We generated obese, insulin-resistant, hyperglycemic mice using
transgenic mice, expressing the ﬂuorochrome Venus speciﬁcally in
proglucagon-producing cells and the ﬂuorochrome Cherry in insulinproducing cells, submitted to a high-fat diet (HFD) during 16 weeks.
These mice have abnormal glucagon and insulin responses to glucose
compared to control low-fat diet (LFD) mice, and speciﬁc molecular
footprints including dysregulation of the Gcg, Foxa1, cMaf, Pax6, UCP2,
and Nav1.3 genes that are all involved in proglucagon gene expression

and glucagon secretion [4e8]. Furthermore, these cells express higher
mRNA levels of Pcsk1/3 and produce more GLP-1 than control alphacells, as previously reported, potentially explained by alpha-cell
adaptation to hyperglycemia or to dedifferentiation [9,10].
miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs of 21e23 nucleotides [11]. They
regulate the expression of target genes by inhibiting translation or by
inducing mRNA degradation. After transcription, miRNA precursors are
involved in a maturation process implicating the enzyme Drosha,
exportin-5 and the endoribonuclease Dicer to form miRNAs [12].
Several studies, investigating Dicer function, have illustrated the
importance of miRNAs in glucose homeostasis. Beta-cell-speciﬁc
Dicer1 knock-out mice, exhibit perturbed islet morphology, reduced
beta-cell number, and altered differentiation as well as impaired GSIS
resulting in progressive hyperglycemia and diabetes [13,14]. Beta-cellspeciﬁc knock-down of Dicer1 in adult mice showed no impact on
beta-cell architecture but strongly reduced insulin content and led to
diabetes [15]. Multiple studies on islets or beta-cells have identiﬁed
miRNAs implicated in beta-cell function, such as miR-375 and miR-

124a, and beta-cell compensation or failure, such as miR-132, miR184 or miR-338-3p [16,17]. Most of these miRNAs were shown to be
up- or downregulated in different diabetic rodent models and human
islets [18,19]. Moreover, it appears that clusters of miRNAs can be coregulated by common mechanisms such as transcription factors or
epigenetic regulators [19,20].
Although most of the studies focused on beta-cells, miRNAs are also
important in alpha-cell biology and function. A deletion of Dicer1 in
the endocrine pancreas using Cre under the control of the Pdx1
promoter resulted in a gross defect in the endocrine lineage
including severe reductions of alpha-cell number [21]. Moreover,
deletion of miR-375 in mice induced an increase of alpha-cell
number, of fasting and fed glucagon plasma levels, and of gluconeogenesis and hepatic glucose output [22]. We hypothesized that
miRNAs are involved in alpha-cell molecular and functional alterations/adaptations in type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we
identiﬁed 16 miRNAs differentially regulated in alpha-cells and 28 in
beta-cells isolated from hyperglycemic HFD compared to LFD mice.
miRNAs regulated in alpha-cells were studied in vitro in mouse
primary alpha-cells to investigate their regulation and biological
functions. We now report that the most highly differentially regulated
miRNA in alpha-cells from hyperglycemic HFD mice, miR-132-3p, is
involved in alpha-cell proliferation and survival, is inversely regulated
by somatostatin and cAMP and potentially regulates alpha-cell
number during diabetes.
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1. Animals
The GLU-Venus x INS-Cherry mice express the Venus and Cherry
ﬂuorochromes respectively in proglucagon- and insulin-producing cells
[8,23]. Mice were bred in conventional housing with a 12/12 h dark/
light period (lights on at 7:00 AM) at the University of Geneva Medical
School animal facility, according to ethical approbation by the Swiss
federal committee.
Mice used to generate alpha- and beta-cells included in the miRNA
microarray experiments were fed by either a LFD containing 10% kcal
fat (D12450B, Research Diets) (protein: 20% kcal; carbohydrate: 70%
kcal; energy density 3.82 kcal/g), or a HFD containing 60% kcal fat
(D12492, Research Diets) (protein: 20% kcal; carbohydrate: 20% kcal;
energy density: 5.21 kcal/g), from the age of 10 weeks and for 16
weeks. At the end of 16 weeks of HFD feeding, mice which did not
develop obesity (weight<40 g) or hyperglycemia (HbA1c<4.5%),
evaluated by Siemens DCA systems Hemoglobin A1c (Siemens
Healthcare Diagnostics Inc.) were excluded from the study (Supp
Table A).
Mice used to generate primary cells for in vitro experiments were fed a
normal chow diet until sacriﬁce.
2.2. Mouse alpha- and beta-cell sorting and primary culture
Venusþ mouse alpha-cells and Cherryþ beta-cells were prepared by
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using Biorad S3 and
Beckman Coulter Astrios, after islet isolation as previously described
[24]. FACS-puriﬁed alpha- and beta-cells used for microarray and
validation qPCR analyses were collected and stored at 80  C until
RNA extraction. Mouse alpha-cells used for primary culture were
placed in 10% FBS supplemented DMEM with 5.6 mM glucose for
overnight recovery and, then, seeded on 804G matrix. For miRNA
mimicking or inhibition experiments, optimal conditions were determined by settings prior to the experiments. The cells were transfected
24 h after plating with 100 nM miR-132-3p mirVana mimics and

inhibitors or respective negative controls (Ambion) using Lipofectamine
RNAiMax (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, miR-132-3p had a 128.7
fold overexpression and a 9.5 fold downregulation respectively (Supp
Fig. A). For in vitro regulation of miRNA expression experiments,
mouse alpha-cells were placed, 24 h after plating, for 48 h in 1% FBS
supplemented DMEM with 0.5% BSA and glucose, palmitate, insulin,
IBMX þ forskolin or somatostatin at different concentrations.
2.3. Human alpha-cell sorting and primary culture
Human islets from non-diabetic donors were obtained from Prodo
Laboratories (Prodo Laboratories Inc, Aliso Viejo, CA). Twenty-four
hours after delivery, 2000 islets (IEQ) were dissociated using
trypsin treatment (5 min at 37  C) with pipetting every minutes.
Dissociated islets cells were then labeled with anti-human alpha-cell
antibody HPa1 (DHIC2-2C12, Thermo Scientiﬁc; 1/50, 30 min at
4  C) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti mouse IgM (Life Technologies; 1/
200, 20 min at 4  C) as previously described [25]. Dead cells were
marked with DRAQ7 (Far-Red Fluorescent Live-Cell Impermeant DNA
Dye, Biostatus). Human alpha-cell fractions were collected with
exclusion of dead cells and doublets using BioRad S3 cell sorter as
described [26]. Primary human alpha-cells were then cultured in
PIM(S) medium using standard procedures [8] and transfected 24 h
after plating with 100 nM miR-132-3p mirVana mimics and inhibitors or respective negative controls (Ambion) using Lipofectamine
RNAiMax (Invitrogen).
2.4. Total RNA and mRNA extraction
mRNA and total RNA, containing miRNAs, were isolated from mouse
pancreatic alpha- and beta-cells as well as human alpha-cells with
RNeasy plus and miRNeasy micro kits (Qiagen) following manufacturer
instructions.
2.5. miRNA microarray
Alpha-cell total RNA extracts from 2 to 3 mice were pooled to obtain
100 ng of total RNA for each sample. The samples were labeled
according to the Agilent miRNA Complete Labeling and Hybridization
Kit. The labeled RNAs were hybridized to Agilent Mouse miRNA
Microarray (Release 21.0, 8  60 K; Catalog number G4872A070155; Agilent Technologies) with 1,881 mouse miRNAs represented, for 20 h at 55  C with rotation. After hybridization and
washing, the arrays were scanned with an Agilent microarray
scanner using high dynamic range settings as speciﬁed by the
manufacturer. Agilent Feature Extraction Software v10.7.3.1 was
used to extract the data. Samples were then quantile normalized
based on summarized and log2-transformed expression levels of
probe sets. Differentially expressed miRNAs were determined using
a moderated t-test implemented in the R Bioconductor package
limma. Five contrasts were extracted from the linear model: alphacells (HFD) vs alpha-cells (LFD); beta-cells (HFD) vs beta-cells (LFD);
alpha-cells (HFD) vs beta-cells (HFD); alpha-cells (LFD) vs beta-cells
(LFD); the interaction between cell type and diet type. In order to
correct for multiple testing, p-values were adjusted across all ﬁve
contrasts by the Benjamini-Hochberg method, which controls for
false discovery rate.
2.6. miRNA targets and pathways computational analysis
Predicted targets of miRNAs were determined with the miRSystem tool
(http://mirsystem.cgm.ntu.edu.tw/). Were only considered validated
targets or targets predicted by, at least, three different algorithms.
KEGG pathways analysis was performed with DIANA-miRPath v.3
pathway analysis web-server [27].

2.7. Glucagon secretion tests
48 h after transfection, primary mouse alpha-cells were incubated in
Krebs buffer containing 5.6 mM glucose for 2 h and then successively
in Krebs buffer containing 5.6 mM glucose for 30 min (basal) and
5.6 mM glucose þ 10 mM arginine or 1 mM glucose for 30 min
(stimulated). Supernatants were collected at the end of each 30 min
incubation step and cells were lysed in acid/ethanol mixture at the end
of tests for glucagon cell content measurements. Glucagon was
quantiﬁed with speciﬁc ELISA kits for mature glucagon (Mercodia AB).
2.8. Proliferation and apoptosis measurements
Primary mouse alpha-cell proliferation was evaluated by BrdU incorporation for 48 h after transfection of miRNA mimics and inhibitors.
BrdUþ cells were labeled with 5-Bromo-2‘-deoxy-uridine Labeling and
detection Kit I (Roche). Alpha-cell apoptosis was evaluated 48 h after
transfection by TUNEL staining with In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit,
TMR red (Roche) or immuno-labeling with anti-active Caspase-3 primary antibody (1:25) (ab2302, abcam) and Alexa Fluor 568 antirabbit
(1:500) secondary antibody. Co-staining for glucagon with rabbit antiglucagon (1:500; Millipore Corporation) primary antibodies and Alexa
Fluor 488 antirabbit (1:1,000) secondary antibodies was realized in
parallel to BrdU or TUNEL and active Caspase-3 staining. At least 35
independent ﬁelds in each condition were captured with an Evos FL
ﬂuorescence microscope (Life Technologies) and automatically
analyzed with Metamorph software to determine apoptotic and proliferative rates.
2.9. mRNAs and miRNAs expression qPCR-quantiﬁcation
After reverse transcription of mRNAs (Prime-script RT Reagent, Takara
Bio Inc.), cDNA were pre-ampliﬁed (cDNA Pre-Amp Master, Roche
Diagnostics) and analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) using
LightCycler 480 SYBR Green technology (Roche Diagnostics) as previously described [8,24].
miRNAs were reverse-transcribed and pre-ampliﬁed (14 cycles) with
the Taqman Advanced miRNA Assays technology (Applied Biosystems)
according to manufacturer instructions. The expression of miRNAs was
then quantiﬁed by qPCR with the Taqman Fast Advanced technology
(Applied Biosystems) with a LightCycler 480 (Roche) and normalized to
the expression of housekeeping miRNAs (miR-186-5p; miR-361-5p)
exhibiting stable expression across tested condition in our experiments (Supp Fig. B).
2.10. Data analyses
Paired and unpaired one-tailed and two-tailed t-tests as well as
multiple t-test with Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli method and twoway ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison post-hoc test were
performed with Prism GraphPad-software (v7.02) when appropriate.
Data are presented as means  SEM and are signiﬁcant at P  0.05 or
FDR  0.05.
3. RESULTS
3.1. Regulation of miRNAs in alpha- and beta-cells of obese
hyperglycemic mice
We performed microarray analyses on 5 LFD and 6 HFD FACS-sorted
mice alpha-cell samples and on 6 LFD and 6 HFD FACS-sorted mice
beta-cell samples. Statistical analysis indicated that 125 miRNAs were
differentially expressed in alpha- versus beta-cells in the LFD group
(Supp Table B) and 150 in alpha-cells compared to beta-cells from HFD
mice (Supp Table C). 16 miRNAs were signiﬁcantly differentially
regulated in alpha-cells from HFD compared to LFD mice. Among these
86

16 miRNAs, 14 were downregulated and 2 were upregulated (Table 1).
28 miRNAs were signiﬁcantly differentially regulated in beta-cells from
HFD vs LFD mice; 6 were downregulated and 22 upregulated (Table 2).
In alpha-cells, the most differentially regulated miRNA in obese hyperglycemic mice compared to controls was miR-132-3p with a 2.26
fold decrease. miR-132-3p was, by contrast, upregulated in beta-cells
with a 1.67 fold increase. An interaction between cell types and
metabolic status was found for 14 miRNAs, including miR-132-3p,
indicating that changes of these miRNAs by HFD-feeding were inﬂuenced by cell types (Supp Table D). miR-132-3p was also differentially
expressed in alpha- versus beta-cells with 5.84 and 21.9 fold enrichments in beta-cells of LFD and HFD mice respectively (Figure 1A),
indicating that miR-132-3p is much more abundant in beta- than in
alpha-cells and is inversely regulated in these cells during diabetes.
We measured by qPCR the expression of miR-132-3p in FACS-sorted
alpha-cells from 9 LFD and 7 HFD mice and conﬁrmed the downregulation of this miRNA with a 2.8 fold decrease in obese hyperglycemic HFD compared to LFD mice (Figure 1B).
3.2. Downregulation of the Meg3-Mirg cluster in hyperglycemic
mice
Interestingly, 8 of the 14 signiﬁcantly downregulated miRNAs in alphacells of obese hyperglycemic mice, miR-487b-3p; miR-369-5p; miR382-5p; miR-409-3p; miR-431-5p; miR-127-3p; miR-329-3p; miR382-3p, were located in a common genomic cluster, the Meg3-Mirg
cluster, expressed from the maternally inherited chromosome 12
(Supp Fig. C). Suggesting that the whole cluster is downregulated in
alpha-cells of diabetic mice.
3.3. miRNAs potential targets
The potential functions associated to the miRNAs differentially
regulated in alpha-cells from obese hyperglycemic mice were
investigated by computational analyses. A miRNA KEGG pathway
analysis performed with DIANA-miRPath predicted signiﬁcant interactions with 11 pathways, including several pathways implicated
in lipid metabolism (fatty acid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism,

Predicted targets of the 16 miRNAs regulated in alpha-cells from obese
hyperglycemic mice were determined by the miRSystem tool and
compared to the mRNAs previously described as regulated in diabetic
alpha-cells [8]. The miRNA showing the most hits was miR-132-3p
with four predicted targets belonging to the diabetic alpha-cell molecular footprint (Foxa1, cMaf, Isl1 and Sca3a). Isl1, UCP2 and Sca3a
were also predicted targets of miR-652-3p, miR-431-5p and miR-4093p respectively (Supp Table E).
3.4. Regulation of miR-132-3p expression in vitro
We compared the sequences of mouse, rat and Human mir-132. mir132 is highly conserved between these species. Sequences of the

sequence of miR-132-3p mature form is identical in the three species
(Supp Fig. D.3).
In order to identify which factors are responsible for the regulation of
miR-132-3p in alpha-cells of obese hyperglycemic mice, we treated
in vitro primary mouse alpha-cells with different factors mimicking
hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, or hyperinsulinemia occurring in
obesity and/or diabetes and measured miR-132-3p expression by
qPCR. The expression of miR-132-3p was not signiﬁcantly regulated
after 48 h treatment with palmitate 500 mM plus glucose 25 mM,
palmitate 500 mM alone, glucose 25 mM alone, nor by insulin
100 nM (Figure 2A). As cAMP was reported to be strongly implicated
in miR-132-3p regulation in beta-cells [20,28], we treated primary
mouse alpha-cells with IBMX 100 mM and forskolin 50 mM during
48 h. This treatment increased by 45% the expression of miR-1323p, indicating that cAMP is a positive regulator of miR-132-3p
expression (Figure 2B). Finally, we evaluated the impact of somatostatin, a potential modulator of cAMP through its coupling with

Gi/o pathway, on miR-132-3p expression. Somatostatin at 100 nM
during 48 h induced a 2.7 fold downregulation of miR-132-3p, in line
with the regulation observed in vivo in obese hyperglycemic mice
(Figure 2C).
3.5. Functional impact of miR-132-3p in primary mouse alphacells
In order to investigate the potential consequences of miR-132-3p
decreases observed in alpha-cells of obese hyperglycemic mice, we
treated primary mouse alpha-cells for 48 h with miR-132-3p inhibitors
and mimics and performed glucagon secretion tests in basal and
stimulated conditions with arginine or low glucose. miR-132-3p
mimicking or inhibition affected neither basal nor arginine- and low
glucose-stimulated glucagon secretions (Figure 3A,B). Modulating
miR-132-3p levels did not change the glucagon secretion fold-change
between basal and stimulated conditions, indicating that miR-132-3p
is not implicated in the stimulation of glucagon secretion by arginine or
low glucose (Figure 3A,B).
As, on one hand, the literature shows that miR-132 is a positive
regulator of proliferation in beta-cells [29] and that alpha-cell mass can

vary during diabetes [30,31]; and as on the other hand, we observed
that alpha-cell mass is unchanged at the end of 16 weeks of HFD
protocol [8], while miR-132-3p is downregulated, we postulated that
the miR-132-3p decrease in alpha-cells may be involved in the control
of alpha-cell mass. We explored the impact of miR-132-3p inhibition
and mimicking on primary mouse alpha-cell by BrdU incorporation. 48 h
after transfection with miR-132-3p mimic, we observed a 47.7% increase of BrdU incorporation and a 21.2% decrease 48 h after transfection with the inhibitor, indicating that miR-132-3p is able to promote
alpha-cell proliferation, and thus alpha-cell number (Figure 4A,B).
Alpha-cells are also characterized by a high resistance to metabolic
stress-induced apoptosis [32]. We hypothesized that miR-132-3p
could be involved in this process and performed TUNEL and
active Caspase-3 staining, 48 h after transfection with miR-132-3p
mimic or inhibitor in standard and glucolipotoxicity culture conditions. miR-132-3p mimic reduced alpha-cell apoptosis through by a
non-signiﬁcant 21% decrease of TUNEL positive cells and a 37%
signiﬁcant decrease of active Caspase-3 positive cells in standard
conditions (Figure 4C,E). Inversely, miR-132-3p inhibition induced
an increase by 79% and by 66% of TUNEL and active Caspase-3

(Figure 4D,F). In glucolipotoxicity conditions TUNEL positive cells
were reduced by miR-132-3p mimicking and increased by its inhibition while active Caspase 3 staining was not signiﬁcantly
affected (Supp Fig. E). These results indicate that miR-132-3p is
implicated in the resistance of alpha-cells to apoptosis per se in
control or metabolic stress conditions.
3.6. Molecular impact of miR-132-3p
To better understand and characterize the mechanisms underlying the
miR-132-3p functions in alpha-cells, we measured by qPCR the

expression of genes coding for proteins involved in alpha-cell identity,
glucagon production, cell proliferation and cellular stress response,
48 h after transfection with miR-132-3p mimic or inhibitor. miR-1323p over-expression in standard culture conditions induced an increase
of Pou3f4 (þ77%), supporting the hypothesis that miR-132-3p might
be involved in cell identity (Figure 5A). Inhibition of miR-132-3p had no
impact on the regulation of this gene (Figure 5B). Expression of the
cellular proliferation-related markers, Mki67 (þ60%) and Tpx2
(þ34%) genes, was also increased by miR-132-3p overexpression
(Figure 5C) and decreased by miR-132-3p inhibition by 28% for Mki67
and 24% for Tpx2 (Figure 5D). Then we measured the effects of miR-

132-3p inhibition on the expression of genes related to cellular stress
and apoptosis in control (0.5% BSA vehicle) and glucolipotoxicity
conditions (0.5% BSA þ 0.5 mM palmitate þ 25 mM glucose). miR132-3p inhibition induced an increase of the endoplasmic reticulum
stress markers Hspa5, Ddit3 as well as of the pro-apoptotic genes
Bbc3, Bax, Bak1 and Trp53. Moreover, miR-132-3p inhibition also
increased anti-apoptotic Bcl2, Bcl2l1 and Mcl1 genes expression
(Figure 5E). Of interest, in glucolipotoxicity conditions, we also
observed an increase of Hspa5, Bbc3, Bak1, Trp53, Bcl2 and Bcl2l1
genes expression after miR-132-3p inhibition (Supp Fig. F). In order to
identify possible direct target mRNAs of miR-132-3p implicated in
proliferation and apoptosis resistance, we evaluated the expression of
the Btg2 and Sirt1 genes, two computationally predicted and validated
targets of miR-132-3p with anti-proliferative and stress resistance
associated functions. We observed a 39% decrease and a 27% increase of Btg2 gene expression in primary mouse alpha-cells treated
with miR-132-3p mimic and inhibitor, respectively. In contrast, Sirt1
was not signiﬁcantly affected by miR-132-3p (Figure 5F,G). This
supports the hypothesis that Btg2 is a possible miR-132-3p direct
target and that miR-132-3p has multiple gene targets involved in cell
proliferation and death as well as cellular stress markers. To conﬁrm
the possible implication of miR-132-3p in the regulation of human
alpha-cells proliferation and apoptosis, we evaluated the molecular
impact of miR-132-3p overexpression and downregulation in human
primary alpha cells. Like in mouse alpha-cells, the overexpression of
miR-132-3p induced an increase of the proliferation marker MKI67
(þ121%) and a decrease of BBC3 mRNA level (12%) without
changes of DDIT3 gene expression, while the inhibition of miR-132-3p
induced a decrease of MKI67 (28%) expression and increase of
BBC3 gene expression (þ32%) without change of DDIT3 mRNA level.
BTG2 expression was not affected in human alpha cells by the modulation of miR-132-3p, suggesting that it is not a direct target in these
cells, at least at the mRNA level (Figure 5H,I).
3.7. Molecular impact of somatostatin treatment
As somatostatin is a negative modulator of miR-132-3p expression
in vitro, we hypothesized that this hormone could regulate alpha-cell
proliferation and apoptosis via miR-132-3p. The treatment of mouse
primary alpha-cells for 48 h with 100 nM somatostatin induced an
increase of Btg2 (þ54%), a decrease of the proliferation marker Mki67
(86%) and an increase of pro-apoptotic genes Bbc3 (þ110%) and
Ddit3 (þ40%), reproducing the principal effects of miR-132-3p inhibition although at higher magnitude (Figure 5J).
4. DISCUSSION
We identiﬁed changes of miRNA expression between obese hyperglycemic and control mice, 16 miRNAs in alpha-cells, and 28 miRNAs
in beta-cells. Previous microarray analyses were performed by Nesca
et al. on whole islets from HFD and db/db mice compared to their
controls. In this study, 79 miRNAs were identiﬁed with a regulation
level higher than 1.5 fold in HFD versus normal diet fed mice [29]. Of
the 16 miRNAs we identiﬁed as regulated in alpha-cells, only one was
identiﬁed by Nesca et al., indicating that alpha-cells have to be puriﬁed
to be studied at the molecular level. We observed a lower regulation
level of miRNAs compared to the study by Nesca et al. in whole islets.
Although we have no clear explanation for these differences, we hypothesize that it could be due to the longer isolation process, adding
trypsin digestion and FACS sorting steps, or to the low and high fat
feeding protocols substantially different in their composition and
duration.

Alpha- and beta-cells miRNA expression proﬁles in LFD mice
showed a signature of 125 miRNAs signiﬁcantly different between
both cell types. Among these 125 miRNAs, 63 were more
expressed in alpha-cells and 62 more in beta-cells. miR-205-5p
and miR-92a-3p were the most alpha-cell speciﬁc. This balanced
numbers of alpha- and beta-cell enriched miRNAs differs with the
results obtained with human alpha- and beta-cells sorted after
dissociation of preﬁxed islets. In the study of Klein et al., 95% of
the differentially expressed miRNAs were more abundant in betacells [33]. The comparison of alpha- and beta-cells miRNAs was
also conducted by comparing bTC3, a beta-cell line, to aTC1-6, a
mouse adenoma pancreatic alpha-cell line, in two different studies,
leading to the identiﬁcation of 9 and 50 miRNAs preferentially
expressed in beta-cells while 14 and 74 were preferentially
expressed in alpha-cells. aTC1-6 enriched miRNAs included miR103, miR-130 and miR-146a which were also alpha-cells
enriched miRNAs in our study [34,35].
Among the 16 miRNAs regulated in alpha-cells of obese hyperglycemic mice compared to controls, 8 were located in the Meg3-Mirg
cluster: miR-487b-3p; miR-369-5p; miR-382-5p; miR-409-3p; miR431-5p; miR-127-3p; miR-329-3p; miR-382-3p. This genomic
imprinted region was described as controlled by epigenetic regulation of two differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in different
models. The intergenic germline-derived differentially methylated
region (IG-DMR) located in chromosome 12, w12 kb upstream of
the MEG3 promoter, is subjected to allele-speciﬁc imprinting and
was recognized as a major distal regulatory element controlling the
expression of the 200 kb downstream microRNA containing genes,
including the MEG3-MIRG cluster [36]. In human type 2 diabetic
islets, hypermethylation of the MEG3-DMR, located in MEG3 promotor, 1.5 kb upstream of the transcription initiation, is correlated
with a downregulation of miRNAs from the cluster [19]. The average
regulation of these 8 miRNAs is a 1.33 fold decrease. The microarray
technology used cannot indicate if this regulation is due to a weak
regulation in each cell or to a strong regulation in part of the cells.
Indeed, the existence of alpha-cell subpopulations was already
described using single-cell transcriptomic approaches [37]. In
induced pluripotent stem cells [iPSCs], low levels of DNA methylation
in the IG-DMR enhancer is necessary to maintain the expression of
lncRNAs and miRNAs essential for the establishment of full pluripotency [38]. Functionally, downregulation of the cluster in alpha-cells
could be a modulator of possible transdifferentiation or dedifferentiation processes in part of alpha-cells.
The in vitro molecular and functional studies were focussed on miR132-3p as it represents the most regulated miRNA between obese
hyperglycemic and control mice in alpha-cells. miR-132-3p was the
only miRNA with a regulation-fold higher than two. However neither
palmitate, high glucose concentration alone or in combination, nor
insulin led to any change in miR-132-3p expression. It is possible
that 48 h treatments are not long enough to reproduce the changes
occurring during the 16 weeks of HFD feeding in vivo or that glucolipotoxicity in vivo includes much more than high glucose, fatty
acids and amino acids. Nevertheless, in isolated rat whole islets,
miR-132 is regulated by 48 h palmitate treatment in the presence of
high glucose concentrations, suggesting a different regulatory
mechanism in beta-cells [29]. Interestingly, miR-132-3p that we
found downregulated in sorted alpha-cells of HFD mice at 16 weeks,
shows an opposite regulation in sorted beta-cells as previously reported in islets of obese and db/db mice as well as in the non-obese
type 2 diabetes Goto-Kakizaki rats [29,39]. The difference between
alpha- and beta-cells could be due to transcriptional positive

regulations of the miR-212/miR-132 cluster by GLP-1 through a
cAMP-dependent pathway in beta-cells [20,28] while alpha-cells,
expressing very low levels of GLP-1 receptor, would be not or
weakly receptive [40]. On the other hand, we can postulate that
somatostatin produced within the islet by delta-cells may mediate
the negative regulation of miR-132-3p in alpha-cells. Indeed, somatostatin, which can be hypersecreted in obese rats [41] and
emerges as a critical modulator of alpha-cell function in controlling
glucagon secretion, and alpha-cell mass [42e44], reduced strongly
miR-132-3p expression in vitro in our study. We hypothesize, that
GLP-1 by stimulating somatostatin secretion in the pancreas may
reduce cAMP through the Gi/o coupled receptor Sst2 and repress
miR-132-3p expression in the same way that it inhibits glucagon
secretion [42,45]. The increased plasma GLP-1 in our model of
obese hyperglycemic mice [8] could so be a central regulator of miR132-3p in both alpha- and beta-cells.
Functionally, neither miR-132-3p inhibition, nor its overexpression,
had an impact on basal as well as arginine- or low glucosestimulated glucagon secretion in opposition to its effects on
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in beta-cells [20,28,29]. However, like in beta-cells, miR-132 is implicated in alpha-cells proliferation [29]. miR-132-3p overexpression increased primary mouse
alpha-cell proliferation and its inhibition decreased the proliferation
rate. This is corroborated by molecular analyses in the presence of
miR-132-3p mimics or inhibitors on the proliferation markers, Mki67
and Tpx2, which were increased by over-expression of miR-132-3p
and decreased by its inhibition in correlation with proliferation in
mouse alpha-cells. We showed that the BTG anti-proliferation factor
2 (Btg2) mRNA, a previously reported direct target of miR-132-3p, is
also regulated in mouse alpha-cells and potentially implicated in this
process by its regulation in an opposite way to miR-132-3p [46].
Interestingly, Btg2 mRNA expression is inversely correlated to the
expression of miR-132-3p between mouse alpha-and beta-cells
(unpublished data). We also observed increased expression of the
transcription factor Pou3f4 gene, implicated in alpha-cell identity,
after miR-132-3p over-expression while miR-132-3p inhibition was
without effects [47,48]. High expression level of miR-132-3p might
be a positive regulator of alpha-cells differentiation, but the results
are at odds with the notion that increased cell proliferation is usually
accompanied with cell dedifferentiation, leaving this observation to
be more fully characterized.
Finally, our data indicate that miR-132-3p is also implicated in alpha-cell
resistance to apoptosis. The high expression levels of the Bcl2 family
proteins balancing the impact of pro-apoptotic factors in alpha-cells was
described as a mechanism of their strong resistance to stress induced
apoptosis compared to beta-cells [32]. Interestingly, pro- and antiapoptotic genes, including Bcl2 and Bcl2l1, were upregulated by the
inhibition of miR-132-3p in both standard and glucolipotoxicity conditions. The surprising ﬁnding of the upregulated pro- and anti-apoptotic
gene expression, induced by miR-132-3p downregulation even in
normal culture conditions leads to hypothesize that, in low miR-132-3p
levels, the ratio of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors is changed in favor of
pro-apoptotic factors, leading to the functional activation of proteins
directly involved in apoptosis induction such as BAX and BAK [49].
The impact of miR-132-3p modulation was partially identical in primary culture of human alpha-cells where miR-132-3p appears as a
positive regulator of the proliferation marker gene MKI67 and a
repressor of the stress marker gene BBC3. Interestingly BTG2 gene
expression was not affected in human alpha-cells in contrast to what
we observed in mouse alpha-cells. This may indicate that the functions
or miR-132-3p are highly conserved through the evolution and may be

mediated by different mRNA targets as reported in a recent bioinformatics study [50].
5. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the proﬁle of regulated miRNAs in alpha-cells of obese
hyperglycemic mice revealed downregulation of miRNAs belonging to
the Mirg-Meg3 cluster whose functional impacts on alpha-cell remains
to be investigated. Our study, focusing on the most regulated miRNA,
miR-132-3p, highlights its potential impact on alpha-cell mass through
a mechanism that may involve the regulation of Btg2. The 2-fold
downregulation of this miRNA, may be a mechanism of action of somatostatin within the islet, restraining proliferation and sensitizing
alpha-cells to apoptosis, contributing to the balanced alpha-cell mass
of HFD mice. Indeed, even if alpha-cells proliferate during HFD [51],
alpha-cells number remains unchanged after 16 weeks of HFD feeding
while a strong increase of beta-cell number is observed [8].
miR-132-3p, may be an interesting target in the study of type 2 diabetes pathophysiology by its dual action in alpha- and beta-cell proliferation, apoptosis and resistance to stress during its evolution. At 16
weeks, its decreased expression in alpha-cells could contribute to the
adaptation of a proliferative phase of glucagon-producing cells while
its upregulation in beta-cells should promote their expansion and insulin secretion.
