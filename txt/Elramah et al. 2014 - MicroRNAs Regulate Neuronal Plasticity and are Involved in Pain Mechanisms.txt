MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as master regulators of gene expression in the nervous
system where they contribute not only to brain development but also to neuronal network
homeostasis and plasticity. Their function is the result of a cascade of events including
miRNA biogenesis, target recognition, and translation inhibition. It has been suggested
that miRNAs are major switches of the genome owing to their ability to regulate multiple
genes at the same time. This regulation is essential for normal neuronal activity and, when
affected, can lead to drastic pathological conditions. As an example, we illustrate how
deregulation of miRNAs can affect neuronal plasticity leading to chronic pain. The origin
of pain and its dual role as a key physiological function and a debilitating disease has
been highly debated until now. The incidence of chronic pain is estimated to be 20–25%
worldwide, thus making it a public health problem. Chronic pain can be considered as
a form of maladaptive plasticity. Long-lasting modiﬁcations develop as a result of global
changes in gene expression, and are thus likely to be controlled by miRNAs. Here, we
review the literature on miRNAs and their targets responsible for maladaptive plasticity
in chronic pain conditions. In addition, we conduct a retrospective analysis of miRNA
expression data published for different pain models, taking into account recent progress in
our understanding of the role of miRNAs in neuronal plasticity.

INTRODUCTION
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding, endogenous ∼23
nucleotide (nt) RNAs that regulate target-gene expression by either
translation inhibition or mRNA degradation (Bartel, 2009). They
were ﬁrst discovered in C. elegans where lin-4 plays a critical role
in the developmental orchestration (Lee et al., 1993). Since then,
the number of identiﬁed miRNAs has reached a thousand in many
species. Owing to their uncommon targeting properties, a single
miRNA species can bind and regulate multiple targets, and it is
now thought that the expression of most, if not all, genes involves
modulation by miRNAs. Thus, the “macro switch” function of
miRNAs in neuronal development is now well documented (Li and
Jin, 2010). More recently, accruing evidence established miRNAs
as essential regulators of proper neuronal function. In particular,
it was demonstrated that miRNAs regulate many proteins involved
in neuronal adaptation to network activity. miRNAs take part in
the morphological and functional changes sustaining neuronal
plasticity. For instance, miR-134 is expressed in hippocampal neurons where it regulates the LIM-domain kinase 1, which represses
coﬁlin, an actin depolymerization factor, thus modifying spine
morphology (Schratt et al., 2006). Another example is miR-284,
which regulates the expression of the glutamate receptor GluA2 at
the neuromuscular junction in Drosophila (Karr et al., 2009).
As an actor in neuronal plasticity, miRNAs are likely to play a
role in the onset and maintenance of neurological diseases. Indeed
screening strategies have identiﬁed altered expression of speciﬁc
miRNAs in Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s disease, and

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

Tourette syndrome patients (Johnson et al., 2012; Salta and De
Strooper, 2012). While these results raise hope for new treatments,
more work is needed to fully differentiate the miRNA changes
that trigger pathological mechanisms from those resulting from
the disease. A tempting hypothesis is that long-term alteration of
miRNA pathways normally regulating basal neuron function could
lead to disease. Long-lasting modiﬁcations of gene expression are
thought to result in chronic disease such as neuropathic pain.
Therefore, miRNA deregulation could play a key role in chronic
pain.
Here, we brieﬂy examine current knowledge on miRNA biogenesis, target recognition, and regulation. Then, we review the
literature to highlight miRNAs that are involved in neuronal
plasticity, with a special focus on chronic pain pathologies.

miRNA BIOGENESIS
To date, miRbase, a specialized miRNA database, comprises
1872 entries for the human genome (Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2006;
Kozomara and Grifﬁths-Jones, 2011). miRNA genes are present
on all chromosomes, with the exception of the human Y chromosome. Nearly 50% of miRNA-coding genes are situated within
the intergenic space and possess their own regulatory elements
(Lagos-Quintana et al., 2001; Corcoran et al., 2009). In contrast,
40% of miRNAs genes are positioned within introns (Rodriguez
et al., 2004; Smalheiser et al., 2008), and 10% are located within
exon terminals. As a consequence, the expression of half of the
miRNA genes depends on the regulation of their host gene, so they

may be involved in the control of genetic networks related to the
expected function of the host gene product (O’Carroll and Schaefer, 2013). An interesting feature is that many miRNA genes are
grouped within clusters, with an intergenic distance ranging from
0.1 to 50 kb, and exhibit a similar expression pattern (Baskerville
and Bartel, 2005). In addition, miRNAs within clusters are often,
but not always, related to each other, while miRNAs from the same
family are occasionally clustered (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2001; Lau
et al., 2001).
Transcription of miRNAs is performed by either RNA Polymerase II or RNA Polymerase III, producing primary miRNA
(pri-miRNA), a large stem-loop structure (3–4 kb in length) with
a 5 cap and a poly(A) tail (Cai et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2004).
Then, this pri-miRNA structure is recognized and processed by
the microprocessor complex which is composed of the ribonuclease Drosha (RNase III enzyme), the RNA-binding protein (RBP)
DGCR8 (DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8; Lee et al.,
2003; Denli et al., 2004; Gregory et al., 2004) and other auxiliary
factors (Han et al., 2004), generating ∼60- to 70-nt-long stem-loop
precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNA; Morlando et al., 2008). Processing of pri-miRNAs into pre-miRNAs occurs concomitantly with
transcriptional events, thus rapidly constituting a nuclear pool of
pre-miRNAs (Morlando et al., 2008). The next step to functional
miRNAs is the export of pre-miRNAs from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm by the karyopherin protein family member, Exportin5, in a GTP-dependent manner (Yi et al., 2003; Bohnsack et al.,
2004; Lund et al., 2004). Once in the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNA is
loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading
complex, where it is further processed into a ∼21-nt-long miRNA
duplex by Dicer, a type-III ribonuclease (Bernstein et al., 2001;
Hutvágner et al., 2001; Ketting et al., 2001; Knight and Bass, 2001).
At this stage, only one strand is ﬁnally incorporated into the RISC,
the “guide” strand, whereas the other strand called “the passenger”
is likely degraded. The criteria deﬁning which of the two strands
is loaded into the RISC still need to be clariﬁed but it appears that,
in most of the cases, it is the one whose 5 end is less tightly paired
(Khvorova et al., 2003; Schwarz et al., 2003).
Another processing pathway independent of the Drosha/DGCR8
microprocessor machinery and previously discovered in
Drosophila and C. elegans (Okamura et al., 2007; Ruby et al., 2007a)
has been recently identiﬁed in mammals. The so-called mirtons are
directly spliced from the introns of mRNA coding genes, directly
exported to the cytoplasm and processed by Dicer (Okamura et al.,
2007; Ruby et al., 2007a).

TARGET RECOGNITION AND TRANSLATION INHIBITION
BASICS OF miRNA:mRNA INTERACTIONS

Loading of the “guide” strand into the Argonaute protein of the
RISC makes it functional and ready to generate mRNA inhibition (Hutvágner and Zamore, 2002; Mourelatos et al., 2002).
The mechanisms and the consequent magnitude of this regulation are dependent on the characteristics of the miRNA:target
mRNA binding. Thus, in metazoans, extensive base pairing has
been demonstrated to induce mRNA cleavage (Hutvágner and
Zamore, 2002; Rhoades et al., 2002; Yekta et al., 2004), whereas
imperfect binding leads to target repression through translational inhibition and/or mRNA destabilization (Lee et al., 1993;

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

Wightman et al., 1993; Lim et al., 2005). In addition, the location
of miRNA binding sites in the target mRNA plays a predominant role on the efﬁcacy of the regulation. Although binding
of miRNA has been demonstrated in the 5 untranslated region
(UTR) and the open reading frame (ORF) of mRNA (Easow et al.,
2007; Lytle et al., 2007; Chi et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2011), these
sites are less effective than those located in the 3 UTR (Kloosterman et al., 2004; Farh et al., 2005; Lewis et al., 2005; Lim et al.,
2005; Grimson et al., 2007; Ruby et al., 2007b; Baek et al., 2008).
This might reﬂect the fact that in 5 UTR and ORF, the translation
machinery has a higher afﬁnity than the RISC, thus displacing the
silencing complex (Bartel, 2009).
The nucleotide sequence in the target mRNA that is engaged
in miRNA binding is called the miRNA recognition element
(MRE; Shukla et al., 2011) or “seed region” (Bartel, 2004). miRNA
target recognition and seed region classiﬁcation have been extensively reviewed previously (see Bartel, 2009). The composition
of this seed region varies but always involves a sequence with
conserved Watson–Crick pairing (i.e., the hydrogen bonding that
pairs guanine–cytosine and adenine–thymine) to the 5 region
of the miRNA centered on nucleotides 2–7 (Bartel, 2009). Several types of seed regions exist depending on the length and
composition of the sequence involved in miRNA:mRNA binding, resulting in different afﬁnities and inhibition properties.
These include canonical sites with a 6- to 8-nt match between
miRNA and mRNA, and non-canonical sites that include additional pairing at the 3 end of the miRNA. Additional factors
have been shown to affect miRNA seed efﬁcacy such as AUrich sites, which have been shown to be more effective (Lewis
et al., 2005; Grimson et al., 2007; Nielsen et al., 2007; Pasquinelli,
2012).
Other factors include the position of the seed within the 3 UTR
of the target-mRNA (Grimson et al., 2007), with sites at the
extremities of the 3 UTR being more accessible than those in the
middle because long UTRs may form occlusive interactions, thus
greatly reducing miRNA site accessibility.
Another important feature is site multiplicity, where the presence of multiple sites for the same or different miRNAs on the
target-mRNA increases the repression response. Multiple sites
might contribute to target mRNA inhibition in either a noncooperative manner or cooperatively. miRNA cooperation results
in a stronger repression than the sum of the individual and independent sites. Cooperative regulation implies that seed sequences
are within a 40-nt region but with a minimum 8 nt gap between
them (Doench et al., 2003; Grimson et al., 2007; Nielsen et al., 2007;
Saetrom et al., 2007).
Given the large and growing number of miRNA species, the
enormous number of putative target mRNAs and the length of
their 3 UTR sequences, the manual prediction of miRNA:mRNA
interactions would be impossible. Therefore, computational analysis using algorithms and prediction databases is the usual method
to identify miRNA targets. Hence, target prediction programs are
based on seed region recognition tools that basically list all the
sites with miRNA-binding properties and rank them accordingly
to the kind of seed, conservation across evolution and some of the
above-mentioned factors known to modulate site efﬁciency (for
review, see Reyes-Herrera and Ficarra, 2012).

MicroRNAs, plasticity, pain

However, despite reﬁnements of prediction tools, the percentage of predicted targets that pass the experimental validation
stage is still sub-optimal. Therefore, it often constitutes a timeconsuming bottleneck in miRNA studies that involve complex
experimental paradigms. In line with this, recent data suggest
that miRNA:mRNA interactions sometimes involve the 3 end of
miRNAs with little evidence for 5 contacts, and some of these
interactions have been shown to be functional (Helwak et al.,
2013). In addition, other parameters not taken into account in
these algorithms could affect the accuracy of target prediction
tools. For instance, there is the importance of the secondary
structure of RNA and its association with RBPs, which inﬂuence
target site accessibility, and thereby its regulation (Brodersen and
Voinnet, 2009).
MECHANISMS OF miRNA-MEDIATED INHIBITION OF TRANSLATION

miRNA binding to its target mRNA is the starting point of a
post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression occurring in
the cytoplasm, mostly by translational repression or mRNA degradation (Valencia-Sanchez et al., 2006; Jackson and Standart, 2007;
Nilsen, 2007; Pillai et al., 2007; Standart and Jackson, 2007). In
fact, microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC)-mediated
gene inhibition has been demonstrated to arise from three putative mechanisms: (i) site-speciﬁc cleavage, (ii) enhanced mRNA
decay, and (iii) translational inhibition. Thanks to recent studies
combining cutting-edge transcriptomic and proteomic analyses,
a genome-wide view of the changes elicited by miRNA down
or up-regulation on the protein output is now available (Baek
et al., 2008; Selbach et al., 2008; Hendrickson et al., 2009; Guo
et al., 2010). These experimental data are critical for validating
the prediction tools for miRNA targeting as well as for comparing the respective roles of the different modes of action driven by
miRNAs.
Site-speciﬁc cleavage

This Ago2-mediated process requires full complementarity
between miRNA and its target (Hammond et al., 2001; Hutvágner
and Zamore, 2002), which seems to be very limited in mammals
(Yekta et al., 2004; Hornstein et al., 2005). Loading of the miRNA
into the Ago2 protein involves conformational changes which
should enhance Watson–Crick pairing to the target mRNA. In
contrast to this rare event, translational inhibition or mRNA
degradation, which both result from partial binding of miRNA
to mRNA, seem to be the most widely occurring mechanisms in
mammals (for review, see Fabian et al., 2010).

not fully understood but it is thought that Ago could compete with
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 for mRNA-cap binding
(Humphreys et al., 2005; Kiriakidou et al., 2007). Furthermore,
miRNAs could prevent translation by inhibiting the association of
the ribosomal subunits (Chendrimada et al., 2007; Thermann and
Hentze, 2007).
At the post-initiation stage, translation inhibition by miRNAs
could be mediated by premature termination and ribosome dropoff (Petersen et al., 2006), stalling of the elongation by slowing
down the ribosome process (Rüegsegger et al., 2001; Mootz et al.,
2004), or co-translational degradation of nascent polypeptides
(Nottrott et al., 2006). However, experimental evidence for these
mechanisms and explaining their interdependence is still only partial. As summarized by Filipowicz et al. (2008), the inhibition
of translation at the initiation or elongation phase is perhaps
not exclusive and it is likely that initiation is always inhibited.
However, ribosomes queuing on the mRNA when elongation is
also inhibited may hide this obligate mechanism (Filipowicz et al.,
2008).
Enhanced mRNA decay

Large-scale analyses of the expression of miRNAs and their predicted mRNA targets have shown an inverse correlation, strongly
suggesting that mRNA degradation is a hallmark of miRNAmediated inhibition of transcripts (Chekulaeva and Filipowicz,
2009). A likely scenario relies on the deadenylation of the mRNA
target, which would prevent circularization of the transcript. Circularization is an essential mechanism for mRNA translation
that also prevents mRNA degradation, since linear transcripts are
more prone to degradation (Wakiyama et al., 2007). Nevertheless,
whether deadenylation precedes (Wakiyama et al., 2007; Iwasaki
et al., 2009) or follows (Fabian et al., 2009; Zdanowicz et al., 2009)
translational inhibition is still an unresolved issue.
Beyond the question of the mechanisms responsible for mRNA
translation inhibition, there is the issue of the sub-cellular localization of this regulation. The most popular hypothesis posits that
mRNAs under miRNA-mediated inhibition are stored (Brengues
et al., 2005; Bhattacharyya et al., 2006) and degraded (Eulalio
et al., 2007; Parker and Sheth, 2007) into cytoplasmic particles
called processing bodies or glycine-tryptophan (GW) bodies.
These cytoplasmic foci are free of translational machinery but are
enriched in proteins that are required for efﬁcient mRNA inhibition (Jakymiw et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2005; Rehwinkel et al., 2005;
Behm-Ansmant et al., 2006).

miRNAs ARE REGULATORS OF NEURONAL ACTIVITY
Translational repression

Protein translation repression by miRNAs may result from various mechanisms: inhibition of translation initiation, inhibition
of translation elongation; protein degradation while translation is
being processed, premature termination of the translation (also
known as ribosome drop-off); or a combination of some of these
mechanisms (Bagga et al., 2005; Pillai et al., 2005; Nottrott et al.,
2006; Petersen et al., 2006).
At the translation initiation step, miRNAs can inhibit protein
production by disrupting the interaction between the 5 -cap and
the 3 -poly(A) tail of the mRNA. The mechanisms involved are

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

Although the way miRNAs regulate their targets is still imperfectly
understood, it is widely accepted that they play a major role in gene
expression regulation. As such, miRNA have a crucial function in
neuronal development where they seem to act as a master switch of
the genome (for review, see Sun et al., 2013). In the mature nervous
system, increasing evidence suggests that miRNA are important for
normal neuronal function (Rajasethupathy et al., 2009; Edbauer
et al., 2010; Cohen et al., 2011; Tognini et al., 2011; Dorval et al.,
2012; Hsu et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2012; Saba et al., 2012).

activity that modulates miRNA expression, which could in turn
regulate targets with an impact on neuronal activity (feed-forward
loop). In addition, neuronal activity should not be considered
as a whole but as the output of thousands of synaptic inputs.
Upon stimulation, single synapses or sets of synapses can go
through intense and selective modiﬁcations in an independent
manner for long periods of time (Martin and Kosik, 2002; Nelson
and Turrigiano, 2008; Wibrand et al., 2010). Although short-term
modiﬁcations of synapses could mainly be the result of posttranslational events, long-term changes require regulation of gene
expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels
(Martin and Kosik, 2002; Wibrand et al., 2010). Thus, local posttranscriptional regulation regulated by activity is certainly a key
element for the maintenance and plasticity of neural connections
(Ashraf and Kunes, 2006; Sutton and Schuman, 2006; Bramham
and Wells, 2007). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that speciﬁc
mRNAs and components of the translational machinery, including
ribosomes and other non-coding RNAs, are localized to dendritic
regions of neurons, where they are likely to serve local translation
(Steward and Levy, 1982; Davis et al., 1987; Torre and Steward,
1992; Trembleau et al., 1994; Landry and Hökfelt, 1998; Steward
and Schuman, 2001). Localization of mRNAs into dendrites is
an active phenomenon involving the 3 UTR sequence of messenger where RBPs bind to initiate transport (for review, see Doyle
and Kiebler, 2011; Goldie and Cairns, 2012). In particular, some
mRNAs are located at the post-synaptic density (PSD) as polyribosome structures (Wells, 2012). Some of these mRNAs encode
proteins such as kinases and translational control factors, which
are attractive candidates to mediate synaptic changes (Eberwine
et al., 2001; Steward and Schuman, 2001). Interestingly, the number of polyribosome-containing spines increases in response to the
long-term potentialization (LTP) protocol (Ostroff et al., 2002),
and their PSD area enlarges when compared to polyribosome-free
spines. This indicates that the presence of polyribosomes produces these structural changes, which were previously ascribed to
changes in synaptic strength (Martin and Kosik, 2002). It has been
suggested that this local translation mechanism could play a major
role in synaptic plasticity and therefore contribute to the molecular basis of learning and memory (Kang and Schuman, 1996;
Campbell and Holt, 2001; Kim et al., 2004).
Recently, miRNAs have been proposed as mediators regulating
local protein synthesis at the synaptic level. miRNAs are enriched
in the brain (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002; Krichevsky et al., 2003;
Kim et al., 2004; Sempere et al., 2004; Kosik and Krichevsky,
2005), where they have been shown to be differently expressed
not only in distinct areas (Landgraf et al., 2007; Bak et al., 2008;
Olsen et al., 2009), but also at the synaptic level (Pichardo-Casas
et al., 2012). Moreover, studies on synaptoneurosomes revealed the
abundance of several components of the miRNAs biogenesis pathway and their silencing complex machinery at PSDs (Lugli et al.,
2005; Pichardo-Casas et al., 2012). Thus, dendritic mRNA translation can be modulated by miRNAs which have been selectively
transported as mature or pre-miRNAs. In response to synaptic activity, this miRNA-driven regulation can either increase or
decrease local mRNA translation through different mechanisms
(Figure 1). Interestingly, not all miRNAs have the same regulation
upon stimulus. However, it is not clear whether the involvement of

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

FIGURE 1 | MicroRNAs can modulate local translation in response to
changes in synaptic activity. After transport from the soma to the
dendrites, some mRNAs are locally translated into proteins. This local
translation mechanism can be modulated in response to synaptic activity
changes by dendritic miRNAs that have also been transported from the
soma. This miRNA-driven mechanism can either decrease (A) or increase
(B) local translation. (A) Decrease of local translation could be the result of
an activity-related miRNA loading into miRISC and speciﬁc binding to target
mRNAs. (B) Increase of translation may be the consequence of an
unbinding of miRNA from target-mRNAs which could then escape P-body
and undergo local translation.

these different types of regulation depends on the type of synaptic
activity or on the type of stimulus.
In addition to their role in physiological conditions, accruing evidence suggests that miRNAs play an important role
in the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases

(reviewed in Johnson et al., 2012; Salta and De Strooper, 2012).
Hence, alterations of speciﬁc miRNAs have been associated with
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s disease, and Tourette syndrome. Furthermore, in other debilitating diseases of the nervous
system, miRNA deregulation has been correlated with altered
neuronal activity, as in chronic pain, which is characterized by
increased excitability within the pain circuitry. One of the ﬁrst
demonstrations of the role of miRNAs in chronic pain came from
a study by Zhao et al. (2010) where a conditional knockout of Dicer
was targeted to sodium channel Nav1.8-positive nociceptor neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). This impairment of miRNA
function induced a strong attenuation of inﬂammatory pain, suggesting that miRNAs are necessary to enhance excitability of this
subpopulation of neurons in response to inﬂammation mediators.
Here, we review speciﬁc miRNAs that have been shown to play a
role in the regulation of neuronal activity and highlight their possible association with pain processes (summarized in Table 1).
In some cases, the causal role of miRNA in pain mechanisms is
strongly suggested by targeted-mRNAs identiﬁcation and functional studies. On the other hand, we conducted a retrospective
analysis of miRNA expression data published for different pain
models and speculated about their potential implication based on
their known targets in normal neuronal activity.

FUNCTIONAL IMPLICATION OF miRNA IN NEURONAL PLASTICITY AND
PAIN SENSITIZATION

One of the ﬁrst studies reporting the control of local translation
by miRNA at the synapse upon synaptic activity showed that miR134 negatively regulates LIMK1 in an activity-dependent manner
(Schratt et al., 2006). LIMK1 is a protein kinase that controls actin
ﬁlament dynamics through inhibition of actin depolymerizing
factor (ADF)/coﬁlin (Bamburg, 1999). This regulation could be
critical for synaptic transmission, synaptic integration, and plasticity since the majority of the excitatory synapses are formed
on dendritic spines, which are actin-rich protrusions from the
dendritic shaft (Hering and Sheng, 2001; Bonhoeffer and Yuste,
2002; Spruston, 2008). The study demonstrated the compartmentalization of miR-134 and its target LIMK1 mRNA at the
synapto-dendritic area. It has been proposed that the miR-134
association with LIMK1 mRNA keeps the LIMK1 mRNA in a
dormant state while it is being transported within dendrites to
synaptic sites. Over-expression of miR-134 inhibits LIMK1 mRNA
local translation, resulting in a negative regulation of the size
of the dendritic spines. Exposure of neurons to external stimuli like the neurotrophic factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) reduces miR-134 inhibition on LIMK1 mRNA translation (Schratt et al., 2006). Recently, the same group reported

central loop nucleotides are critical because of an interaction with
the Asp-Glu-Ala-His-box (DEAH-box) helicase DEAH box protein 36 (DHX36). DHX36 is known to compete with Dicer in
vitro, and Argonaute complexes that contain DHX36 are devoid of
Dicer activity (Höck et al., 2007). Indeed, knockdown of DHX36
displayed a signiﬁcant reduction in the percentage of dendritic
pre-miR-134, without affecting the global levels of pre-miR-134 or
mature miR-134. Consistently with the role of miR-134 on spine
morphology, functional experiments revealed that DHX36 negatively regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis in hippocampal
neurons (Bicker et al., 2013).
One of the ﬁrst studies on a possible role of miRNAs in pain
showed that miR-134 is modulated in the trigeminal ganglion in
response to inﬂammatory pain (Bai et al., 2007). These authors
induced inﬂammatory pain by injecting complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into the rat masseter muscle, a paradigm known to
produce transient inﬂammation accompanied by allodynia. Interestingly, miR-134 was down-regulated at the onset of pain, 30 min
after CFA injection, returned to control level 1 day later, showed an
over-expression rebound at day 4 and ﬁnally returned to control
level at day 12. This phasic deregulation of miR-134 expression
suggests that it could be an adaptive response to the early phase
of inﬂammation. Another study in the chronic constriction injury
(CCI) model showed that miR-134 was up-regulated in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord at day 14 after surgery (Genda et al.,
2013). In this case, miR-134 deregulation occurred later after the
onset of the painful behavior and could have been a consequence
of the pain mechanisms. In contrast, our own results show that
miR-134 was down-regulated 7 days after injury in the dorsal
horn of a rat model of sciatic nerve ligation. This was accompanied by an up-regulation of LIMK1, the miR-134 target (A.
Salam et al., unpublished data). Therefore, it will be important to
undertake functional studies to elucidate the role of miR-134 in
chronic pain.
miR-132 is another example of activity-modulated miRNA.
Experiments where neuronal activity is increased through a
bicuculline-mediated blockade of GABAA inhibitory tone showed
a rapid increase in the expression of miR-132 precursor and
mature miR-132 (Wayman et al., 2008). Interestingly, this
regulation was attenuated by pretreatment with the selective
N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist amino5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV). In addition, KCl treatment
increased transcription of the miR-132 precursor, suggesting that
different modalities of neuronal activity stimulation also trigger a
similar miR-132 increase. The explanation lies in the pathway leading to miR-132 over-expression. Indeed, inhibitors for CaM kinase,
MEK–ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase–extracellular
signal-regulated kinase) or CREB (cAMP response elementbinding protein), all prevent miR-132 up-regulation upon activity
enhancement, suggesting that miR-132 is regulated predominantly
by the CREB pathway. miR-132 directly targets p250GAP, a protein
known to inhibit Rho family GTPases (Taniguchi et al., 2003; Zhao
et al., 2003). The ﬁnal outcome of miR-132 over-expression is an

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

increase in dendrite morphogenesis, presumably as a response to
Rac activity. Indeed, the same group recently proposed that miR132 regulates dendritic spinogenesis through the Rac1-Pak actin
remodeling pathway (Impey et al., 2010). Another target of miR132 is methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), which is involved
in dendritic development and synaptogenesis and whose modulation can affect synaptic plasticity (Klein et al., 2007). Additional
evidence of miR-132 having an impact on neuronal morphology
came from transgenic experiments where the genomic locus containing miR-132 (and miR-212 as well) was deleted, leading to
a dramatic decrease in dendritic length, arborization, and spine
density (Magill et al., 2010). The impact of miR-132 regulation
on spinogenesis is revealed in synaptic plasticity paradigms. For
instance, in vitro short-term plasticity is affected by miR-132 overexpression without altering basal synaptic transmission (Lambert
et al., 2010). In vivo, short-term recognition memory is impaired
by miR-132 over-expression in the perirhinal cortex. This results
from a deﬁcit in both long-term depression and potentiation
(Scott et al., 2012). In the visual cortex, two recent studies demonstrated that miR-132 is a key component of experience-dependent
plasticity. Tognini et al. (2011) showed that monocular deprivation decreased miR-132 expression in the cortex contralateral to
the deprived eye. Counterbalancing this miR-132 decrease with
miR-132 mimic supplementation completely blocked ocular dominance plasticity. At the same time, Mellios et al. (2011) identiﬁed
miR-132 as the miRNA whose expression is the most affected by
dark rearing and/or monocular deprivation. In addition, miR-132
inhibition occluded ocular dominance plasticity after monocular deprivation, which is associated with an altered maturation
of dendritic spines. Finally, a recent study on olfactory bulb
neurons born in the neonatal subventricular zone revealed that
miR-132 is essential for normal dendritic complexity and spine
morphology (Pathania et al., 2012). In conclusion, and as previously proposed (Tognini and Pizzorusso, 2012), ﬁnely regulated
miR-132 expression seems to be essential for plasticity. Thus, too
high an expression would make dendritic spines too stable. Too low
an expression would lead to very unstable spines, thus impeding
synaptic plasticity.
Vo et al. (2005) demonstrated that BDNF triggered miR132 up-regulation in cortical neurons. Interestingly, BDNF was
recently identiﬁed as a modulator of nociception. BDNF is upregulated in the DRG and the spinal cord in inﬂammatory and
neuropathic pain models (reviewed in Merighi et al., 2008 and
Vanelderen et al., 2010, respectively), where it is associated with
an increased excitatory synaptic drive. In addition, in most
cases, intrathecal BDNF injections exhibit pro-nociceptive effects
(Merighi et al., 2008). Thus, one could hypothesize that the
effect of BDNF on nociceptive behavior could partially be the
result of a BDNF-driven miR-132 over-expression. Thus, BDNF
would induce an up-regulation of miR-132, which in turn would
increase dendrite morphogenesis and arborization in the nociceptive pathway, resulting in an increased transmission of the
pain signal. In patients with complex regional pain syndrome
(CRPS), a disabling chronic neuropathic pain affecting one or
more extremities, miR-132 blood levels were signiﬁcantly altered
(Orlova et al., 2011). Apart from the direct nociceptive pathway,
other nervous structures like the limbic system may inﬂuence pain

perception. Indeed, the hippocampus is thought to be part of
the descending anti-nociceptive system, potentially exerting an
inhibitory role in neuropathic pain (Basbaum and Fields, 1979).
Arai et al. (2013) screened miRNA expression in the hippocampus of animals submitted to the CCI paradigm of neuropathic
pain. miR-132 was down-regulated early after the onset of the
neuropathic behavior and stayed under-expressed until the latest
time-point analyzed. Thus, it is tempting to hypothesize that this
modulation of miR-132 could lower the excitatory drive of the
hippocampus and therefore lower the anti-nociceptive effect on
the spinal pain pathway.
miR-188 is another activity-regulated miRNA with a proven
synaptic plasticity tuning function. Lee et al. (2012) found that
miR-188 was up-regulated in hippocampal slices in response to the
LTP protocol. Neuropilin-2 (Nrp-2), one of the predicted targets of
miR-188, is down-regulated after the LTP procedure and luciferase
experiments conﬁrmed the interaction. Nrp-2 is a receptor of
semaphorin 3F, which induces the repulsion of neuronal growth
cones expressing Nrp-2 (Kolodkin and Ginty, 1997; Kruger et al.,
2005). In addition, miR-188 treatment can rescue the decreased
miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency and
reduction of spine density induced by Nrp-2 over-expression, suggesting that miR-188 plays a role in synaptic plasticity by buffering
Nrp-2 expression.
Despite its potentially crucial role in neuronal function, evidence for the involvement of miR-188 in pain mechanisms is very
scarce. However, one study reported an altered expression under
pain conditions. Arai et al. (2013) quantiﬁed a down-regulation of
miR-188 in the hippocampus of CCI animals but the signiﬁcance
of this modiﬁcation remains to be elucidated.
The role of miRNAs in dendritic spine remodeling as a substrate
for synaptic plasticity has also been evidenced in vivo. Lippi et al.
(2011) exposed adult mice to psychoactive drugs like nicotine,
cocaine, or amphetamine and quantiﬁed miRNA expression in
different brain regions. Many miRNAs were regulated in response
to these neuroadaptation paradigms, and especially the miR29a/b locus was consistently over-expressed. In vitro experiments
conﬁrmed that these miRNAs were up-regulated in an activitydependent manner. Arpc3 was identiﬁed as a target of miR-29a/b.
This protein is part of the ARP2/3 actin nucleation complex which
plays a critical role in actin branching, a mechanism involved in
dendritic spine maturation. Therefore, this work strongly suggests that miR-29a/b regulates the activity-dependent structural
plasticity associated with psycho-stimulant exposure.
Several studies identiﬁed a deregulation of miR-29a/b in pain
conditions. The ﬁrst evidence came from Bai et al. (2007) who
reported a down-regulation of this miRNA in the trigeminal
ganglion neurons after inﬂammatory muscle pain. It was later
conﬁrmed in two other pain conditions, the CRPS (Orlova et al.,
2011) and the CCI model (Genda et al., 2013). Nevertheless, these
studies did not investigate the subsequent regulation of Arpc3 or
any other target of miR-29a/b, so the role of miR-29a/b in pain
processing still needs to be elucidated.
In the context of chronic exposure to drugs of abuse, Saba
et al. (2012) focused their attention on the regulation of miRNAs
in the nucleus accumbens. This is one of the most important
brain regions in behavioral responses to drugs of abuse and is

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

elicited by dopamine release. Synaptoneurosome preparations
revealed a strong enrichment of miR-181a in response to treatment. A previous study showed that miR-181a expression in the
striatum was regulated by Ago2 in cocaine addiction (Schaefer
et al., 2010). This miRNA was predicted to target GluA2 and was
conﬁrmed in luciferase experiments (Saba et al., 2012). In addition, miR-181a over-expression in hippocampal cultures reduced
AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid)
receptor surface clusters, spine volume, and mEPSC frequency.
Finally, the association between miR-181a and drugs of abuse has
been highlighted (Chandrasekar and Dreyer, 2011). In that study,
lentiviral over-expression of miR-181a in the nucleus accumbens enhanced cocaine-induced conditioned place preference.
Two studies performed on the miRNA expression in the dorsal horn of spinal cord in neuropathic pain models quantiﬁed
a down-regulation of miR-181a (Li et al., 2013) or other members of the miR-181 family, namely miR-181b/c/d (von Schack
et al., 2011). Thus, this miR-181 down-regulation could lead to an
up-regulation of the excitatory receptor GluA2 in the nociceptive
pathway.
Involvement of AMPA receptors in neuropathic pain mechanisms has already been suggested (for review, see Garry and
Fleetwood-Walker, 2004). Unfortunately, the expression of GluA2
was not assessed in these two miRNA studies. Interestingly,
another study on a different model, chronic pelvic pain, revealed
a role of miR-181a through the regulation of a different target, the inhibitory receptor GABAAα−1 (Sengupta et al., 2013).
Pelvic pain was experimentally elicited by intra-vesicular injections of zymosan (a carbohydrate extracted from yeast and
known to induce inﬂammation) into the bladder at postnatal
day 14. This induced long-lasting neuroanatomical and neurophysiological changes in the nociceptive system still present
at postnatal day 60. At that stage, zymosan-treated animals
were characterized by visceral hypersensitivity, an up-regulation
of miR-181a and a down-regulation of GABAAα−1 expression in the lombo-sacral segment of the spinal cord. Bioinformatics analyses identiﬁed multiple sites for miR-181a/b in
the 3 UTR of GABAAα−1 and luciferase experiments proved
the inhibitory effect of miR-181a on GABAAα−1 translation.
These results strongly suggest that this miR-181a-induced downregulation of GABAA receptors results in a loss of inhibition in
the spinal cord sustaining long-lasting visceral hypersensitivity.
They highlight the importance of target identiﬁcation in miRNA
studies.
N -methyl-D-aspartate receptors are another kind of glutamate
receptor known to play a crucial role in synaptic transmission
and plasticity. Altered NMDA-mediated signaling is associated
with behavioral impairments in psychiatric disorders. Kocerha
et al. (2009) demonstrated that miR-219 is down-regulated in the
prefrontal cortex in response to pharmacological or genetic disturbances of NMDA signaling. In addition, they showed that
miR-219 targets calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
II (CaMKII) subunit γ, a downstream component of the
NMDA signaling cascade. Thus, miR-219 down-regulation upon
NMDA inhibition appears to be a compensatory mechanism that
attenuates behavioral disorders associated with acute receptor
antagonism.

MicroRNAs, plasticity, pain

Two miRNA screening studies suggest that miR-219 may be
involved in pain mechanisms. The ﬁrst evidence came from a
model of traumatic spinal cord injury where miR-219 was significantly down-regulated 7 days after contusion (Liu et al., 2009).
On the contrary, sciatic nerve ligation (CCI model) was demonstrated to induce an up-regulation of this miRNA (Genda et al.,
2013). However, in both cases the investigation of targeted mRNA
still needs to be conducted to shed light on the pathological
role of miR-219 in pain pathways. In addition, the group of
M. Sheng demonstrated that the expression of the NR2A subunit of NMDARs was regulated by miR-125b in hippocampal
neurons (Edbauer et al., 2010). Indeed, endogenous miR-125b
affected NMDAR composition and therefore induced functional
changes in channel kinetics. As a consequence, miR-125b expression is likely to be critical for synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, a
CCI pain model induced the down-regulation of miR-125b in the
hippocampus (Arai et al., 2013), a structure that is part of the
descending anti-nociceptive system.
miR-124 is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the brain
and its role in the development of the mammalian brain is now
well established. Thus, miR-124 is a neuronal differentiation promoter that also acts as an inhibitor of neuronal stem cells (Cheng
et al., 2009; Yoo et al., 2009; Åkerblom et al., 2012). During X.
laevis development, miR-124 plays a crucial role in timing the
axon pathﬁnding of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs; Baudet et al.,
2012). Thus, a key event in the correct navigation of RGC axons
is a change in growth cone sensitivity to guidance cues. Baudet
et al. (2012) demonstrated that miR-124 regulates the initiation of
growth cone responsiveness to semaphorin Sema3A. In addition,
miR-124 was shown to regulate neuronal process complexity by
modulating the small GTPase RhoG (Franke et al., 2012). Indeed,
RhoG is a critical modulator of the actin cytoskeleton. Consequently, RhoG inhibits axonal branching so miR-124-mediated
inhibition of RhoG stimulates axonal and dendritic complexity. Yang et al. (2012) demonstrated that miR-124 is a direct
regulator of the transcription factor Zif268, which is essential for activity-related modulation of synaptic transmission and
cognition.
In the context of chronic pain, miR-124 down-regulation in
DRG neurons was reported in inﬂammatory muscle pain (Bai
et al., 2007), as well as in sciatic nerve after peripheral nerve crush
(Wu et al., 2011). Moreover, intrathecal injection of miR-124 had
an anti-nociceptive effect in both inﬂammatory and nerve injuryinduced chronic pain models (Willemen et al., 2012). Finally,
Niederberger’s group showed that intravenous injection of miR124 alleviates the nociceptive response to the formalin test and
identiﬁed the target involved as MeCP2 (Kynast et al., 2013). Thus,
in addition to miR-132 (Klein et al., 2007), miR-124a also regulates MeCP2 translation. MeCP2 is an epigenetic modulator of
BDNF, one of the major players in inﬂammatory pain mechanisms
(Merighi et al., 2008).
One of the interesting characteristics of miRNAs that has
been conserved through evolution is that a given miRNA has
the potential to regulate multiple targets owing to the permissive hybridization to target mRNAs. This mechanism of action is
now well accepted and it can have an important impact on gene
expression regulation. Thus, one or few miRNAs could regulate the

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

expression of multiple genes that participate in the same function
or which constitute the different subunits of a macromolecular
complex (Ferretti et al., 2008; Harraz et al., 2012).
In the context of chronic pain, we demonstrated such a multiple targeting by one miRNA. Indeed, we showed that a single
miRNA, miR-103, simultaneously regulates the expression of the
three subunits of the Cav1.2-comprising L-type calcium channel (Cav1.2-LTC) in an integrative regulation. Sensitization to
pain involves the activation of various types of voltage-gated calcium channels. Some control synaptic transmission (Matthews
and Dickenson, 2001; Bourinet et al., 2005; Altier et al., 2007)
while others regulate intrinsic membrane properties. Among the
latter, Cav1.2-LTC regulates gene expression underlying long-term
plastic changes (Dolmetsch et al., 2001; Fossat et al., 2010). miR103-mediated modulation of Cav1.2 function is bidirectional since
knocking-down or over-expressing miR-103 respectively up- or
down-regulate the level of Cav1.2-LTC translation. Functionally,
we showed that miR-103 knockdown in naive rats results in hypersensitivity to pain. Moreover, miR-103 was down-regulated in
neuropathic animals and miR-103 intrathecal applications successfully relieved pain, thus identifying miR-103 as a possible novel
therapeutic target in neuropathic chronic pain (Favereaux et al.,
2011).
ACTIVITY-INDUCED MODULATION OF miRNA LEVELS

A set of evidence is growing to suggest that miRNAs can regulate
neuronal activity by modulating the expression of ion channels,
the morphology of dendritic spines and the molecular pathways
downstream from receptor activation. However, the mechanisms
that induce an activity-related modulation of miRNA-mediated
inhibition of target genes remain poorly understood. Recent
reports mostly in non-neuronal cells showed that it involves regulation of both the metabolism and function of miRNAs, and
some of these mechanisms were also found to play a crucial role in
neurons (for review, see Krol et al., 2010b). Below, we summarize
the known mechanisms that modulate miRNA levels as a result of
activity variations in neurons.
First, modulation of miRNA levels in response to activity
could result from transcription regulation as for mRNAs. Indeed,
Nomura et al. (2008) found that the transcription of miR-184,
a brain-speciﬁc miRNA, is repressed by the binding of MeCP2.
miR-184 is an imprinted gene exclusively expressed from the
paternal allele. Interestingly, enhancement of neuronal activity
by high-KCl treatment induced MeCP2 phosphorylation and the
consequent release of phosphorylated MeCP2 from the miR-184
promoter region. Thus, the increase in miR-184 levels in response
to neuronal activity involves at least an augmented transcription
of miR-184.
CREB is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in nervous system development and plasticity (reviewed in Lonze and
Ginty, 2002). A genome-wide screen for CREB-binding sites identiﬁed hundreds of locations that are associated with non-coding
RNAs and miRNAs, including miR-132 (Vo et al., 2005). DNase
I footprinting assay conﬁrmed the CREB binding at two consensus cAMP regulatory elements (CREs) in the close 5 region
of the miR-212/-132 locus. CREB is known to be activated by
neurotrophins such as BDNF, and the authors demonstrated that

www.frontiersin.org

February 2014 | Volume 8 | Article 31 | 8

Elramah et al.

MicroRNAs, plasticity, pain

miR-132 transcription was enhanced in response to BDNF. In
addition, CREB inhibition partially blocked the BDNF-induced
increase of miR-132, strongly suggesting that this mechanism
involved the CREB pathway. Wayman et al. (2008) demonstrated
that miR-132 is regulated by CREB in an activity-dependent
manner. Hence, in hippocampal neuronal cultures, inhibition
of GABAA inhibitory tone with bicuculline increased synaptic activity and the levels of miR-132 precursor and mature
forms. Interestingly, blockade of CREB-dependent transcription
abolished the miR-132 up-regulation in response to synaptic
activity.
Second, the function of miRNA can be modulated by regulating
miRISC components. Hence, MOV10, the mammalian ortholog
of the SDE3 helicase Armitage in Drosophila (Ashraf et al., 2006),
is present at synapses and undergoes rapid proteolysis in response
to NMDAR-mediated activity (Banerjee et al., 2009). As a consequence, it relieves miRNA-mediated translation inhibition of key
proteins at the synapse like CaMKII or LIMK1 (Ashraf et al., 2006;
Banerjee et al., 2009).
Another possible mechanism could be the activity-dependent
regulation of dendritic P-bodies. Cougot et al. (2008) demonstrated that ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) with a P-body-like
structure are present in dendrites and that they exhibit motorized
movements upon synaptic activation to relocate to distant sites
(Cougot et al., 2008). In addition, neuronal activation induced a
loss of AGO2 from these P-body-like structures, suggesting that it
may regulate local translation. Thus, inhibited messenger RNPs
(mRNPs) may be stored in these particles at resting state and
then be released in response to synaptic activity in order to be
translated.
Besides regulation of miRISC components, recent evidence
suggests that synergistic pathways may contribute to miRNA function and could therefore be activity-regulated. Hence, FMRP
(fragile X mental retardation protein) is a protein with multiple RNA-binding domains that acts as a translational suppressor
of particular mRNAs (Bassell and Warren, 2008). Interestingly,
FMRP interacts with RISC proteins and miRNAs, although it is
not necessary for miRNA-mediated inhibition (Caudy et al., 2002;
Ishizuka et al., 2002; Jin et al., 2004). Edbauer et al. (2010) recently
showed that both FMRP and miR-125b bound NR2A NMDAR
subunit mRNA, thus leading to translation inhibition. Moreover,
the inhibition of NR2A by FMRP is enhanced by miR-125b and
FMRP depletion reversed miR-125b effects, strongly suggesting a
synergistic effect.
Finally, obtaining a net change in miRNA levels without
affecting miRNA transcription could be the result of miRNA
decay alterations. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that miRNA
turnover is fast in neuronal cells owing to rapid decay (Krol et al.,
2010a). In addition, the authors demonstrated that the rate of
miRNA decay is activity-dependent. Thus, blocking neuronal
activity with either tetrodotoxin (TTX; inhibiting action potentials) or 6-nitro-sulfamoyl-benzo-quinoxaline-dione/3-carboxypiperazin-propyl phosphonic acid (NBQX/CPP; inhibiting glutamate transmission) reduced miRNA decay. Some elements of
the enzymatic machinery involved in miRNA degradation have
recently been discovered (Ramachandran and Chen, 2008; Chatterjee and Grosshans, 2009). However, the factors responsible for

Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience

the rapid and activity-dependent miRNA decay in neurons are
still unknown and constitute a new challenge. The most recent
breakthrough in our understanding of miRNA regulation in neurons came from an underestimated RNA class, circular RNAs
(circRNAs). circRNAs were ﬁrst discovered in plants (Sanger
et al., 1976) and then in unicellular organisms (Grabowski et al.,
1981), but the best-known circRNA is the sex-determining region
Y RNA (Sry) which is highly expressed in testes (Capel et al.,
1993). Recently, two groups identiﬁed a brain-expressed circRNA
[(named CDR1as (cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 antisense) or circular RNA sponge for miR-7 (ciRS-7)] that contains
roughly 70 target sites for miR-7 (Hansen et al., 2013; Memczak
et al., 2013). This circRNA acts as a natural miRNA sponge since
it binds several miR-7 copies at a time, thus reducing miR-7
inhibition on mRNA targets. Interestingly, a very recent study
identiﬁed miR-7 as a regulator of neuronal activity in chronic
pain conditions. Hence, Sakai et al. (2013) showed that miR-7a
was strongly down-regulated in the DRG of neuropathic pain
models in animals. They demonstrated that miR-7a targets the
β2-subunit of voltage-gated sodium channel, thus increasing the
excitability of nociceptive neurons. In addition, miR-7a exogenous
over-expression in DRG of injured animals alleviated neuropathic
pain.

CONCLUSION
How miRNAs regulate neuronal function in response to activity
and whether deregulation of these mechanisms triggers pathological states are still poorly understood. For instance, are the
miRNA pathways that control neuronal fate during development
also involved in brain homeostasis? What are the mechanisms that
could modulate miRNA expression in response to neuronal activity? Do the pathways involved in miRNA regulation depend on
the kind of stimulus or on the miRNA species? What is the spatial resolution of miRNA control on local translation? What is the
therapeutic potential of targeting activity-regulated miRNA?
The analysis of miRNA regulation in challenging pathological conditions such as chronic pain may help to highlight
crucial miRNA mechanisms that are discreet in basal conditions. In the past few years, many studies have screened for
miRNA expression in various animal models and in cohorts
of patients with diverse neurodegenerative diseases. Although
highlighting biomarker miRNAs with a possible value for therapeutic approaches, this kind of approach does not improve our
understanding of miRNA targeting and function in pathological mechanisms. Indeed, it would be risky to evaluate targets
of candidate miRNAs on algorithm-based prediction databases
only, since the number of putative targets is very large and conﬁrmation of targeting sometimes difﬁcult to achieve. Therefore,
it will be important to improve miRNA target prediction tools
maybe by considering recent experimental data suggesting that
“seed” region may not be the only signature of miRNA targeting (Helwak et al., 2013). Moreover, it would be interesting to
compare miRNA and mRNA expression data as often as possible in the light of experimentally conﬁrmed miRNA:mRNA
interactions.
Nevertheless, the various experimental paradigms with their
sometimes conﬂicting data could hinder progress toward a better

understanding of miRNA function. Therefore, the use of uniﬁed
experimental parameters could further clarify the role of miRNA
in neuronal plasticity. The large body of pre-existing data provides
solid evidence for the involvement of miRNA regulation in both
physiological and pathological conditions. Thus, miRNA is an
attractive potential therapeutic target.
