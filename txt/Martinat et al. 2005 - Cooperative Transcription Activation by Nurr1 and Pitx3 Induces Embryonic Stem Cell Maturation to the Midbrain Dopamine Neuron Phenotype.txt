Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons play a central role in the regulation of voluntary movement, and their degeneration is associated with Parkinson’s disease. Cell replacement therapies, and in
particular embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived DA neurons, offer a
potential therapeutic venue for Parkinson’s disease. We sought to
identify genes that can potentiate maturation of ES cell cultures to
the midbrain DA neuron phenotype. A number of transcription
factors have been implicated in the development of midbrain DA
neurons by expression analyses and loss-of-function knockout
mouse studies, including Nurr1, Pitx3, Lmx1b, Engrailed-1, and
Engrailed-2. However, none of these factors appear sufficient
alone to induce the mature midbrain DA neuron phenotype in ES
cell cultures in vitro, suggesting a more complex regulatory network. Here we show that Nurr1 and Pitx3 cooperatively promote
terminal maturation to the midbrain DA neuron phenotype in
murine and human ES cell cultures.

S

everal transcription factors have been implicated in the
regulation of mammalian midbrain dopamine (DA) neuron
development. Expression of the orphan nuclear receptor transcription factor Nurr1 is initiated in postmitotic midbrain DA
neuron precursors at embryonic day 10.5 in the mouse, just
preceding expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (1). Nurr1 is
expressed broadly at subsequent stages of development. Nurr1deficient animals fail to express TH in midbrain DA neurons, but
other midbrain DA neuron markers such as Pitx3, Lmx1b, and
En1 remain unaltered during development (2–4). Thus, Nurr1 is
not required for specification of the early midbrain DA neuron
cell fate but does regulate a subset of phenotypic markers. At
later stages, Nurr1-deficient mice lack expression of markers for
midbrain DA neuron maturation, such as the DA transporter
(DAT), which is relatively specific to this cell population.
Expression analyses and loss-of-function knockout mouse
studies have revealed roles for additional transcription factors in
the specification and maturation of midbrain DA neurons,
including the homeodomain proteins Lmx1b (5), Pitx3 (6–9), and
En1 (10, 11). None of these factors are uniquely expressed in
midbrain DA neurons, nor are they required for TH expression.
However, each of these factors is necessary for the complete
maturation and survival of the midbrain DA neuron population.
Overexpression of Nurr1 alone in neuronal cell lines (12),
primary neuronal precursor cells (13), or embryonic stem (ES)
cultures (14, 15) appears to promote the expression of a subset
of midbrain DA neurons markers in vitro, including TH, but this
may reflect a broad proneural activity (16). Pitx3 overexpression
alone in undifferentiated ES cultures or in neuron progenitor
cells is not sufficient to induce a mature midbrain DA neuron
phenotype but may promote expression of a subset of markers
(13, 17). Thus, we hypothesized that multiple transcription

factors may collaborate within a network to induce late events in
midbrain DA neuron maturation. Here we show that Nurr1 and
Pitx3 synergistically promote terminal maturation to the midbrain DA neuron phenotype in murine and human ES cell
cultures.
Results
Nurr1 and Pitx3 Induce Murine ES Cell Differentiation to the Midbrain
DA Neuron Phenotype. We sought to investigate interactions

among the transcription factors implicated in midbrain DA
neuron development using an ES cell in vitro differentiation
assay. Murine MM13 ES cell cultures were differentiated in vitro
by an embryoid body (EB) protocol, as described in ref. 18.
Briefly, differentiation is initiated by growth in suspension as
EBs, followed by maintenance in defined adherent culture
conditions that leads to the expansion of neuronal precursors
and subsequent maturation. These culture conditions recapitulate the in vivo temporal expression pattern of midbrain DA
neuron developmental markers (see the supporting information,
which is published on the PNAS web site).
Lentiviral expression vectors (19) that harbor Nurr1, Pitx3,
Lmx1b, En1, or control vector alone were introduced at the
neural precursor stage, approximating the normal temporal
expression of the endogenous genes. Transgene expression with
lentiviral transduction was observed in ⬎95% of cells (data not
shown). Surprisingly, the combined transduction of Nurr1 and
Pitx3 dramatically and synergistically induced expression of the
late marker, DAT, but not the earlier marker TH, as quantified
by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 1A). When transduced individually,
only En1 appeared to significantly induce expression of DAT,
but we chose to focus our attention on the more robust and
synergistic action of Nurr1 and Pitx3.
Similar findings were obtained with a second independent
murine ES cell line, DY-1, that expresses a midbrain DA neuron
specific fluorescent marker, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein
(EYFP), under the regulation of the Cre recombinase gene
‘‘knocked-in’’ to the DAT locus (20). Nurr1 and Pitx3 cotransduction coordinately increased the number of EYFP-positive
cells in DY-1 cultures (Fig. 1B) or of DAT-positive cells in MM13
cultures (Fig. 1C; see supporting information). In contrast,
Nurr1 alone increased expression of the earlier midbrain DA
neurons marker, TH (Fig. 1 A–C), consistent with prior reports
of a direct role for Nurr1 in the induction of TH expression (13,
14, 21). Most (⬎90%) of the EYFP-positive cells in the Nurr1 and

Nurr1 and Pitx3 represents a general mechanism for the induction of midbrain DA neuron maturation, we extended our
analyses to human ES cell cultures. Prior studies have described
the differentiation of human ES cultures into TH-positive cells
in vitro (24, 25), but the roles of transcription regulatory factors
have not been explored. Human H9 ES cells were differentiated
by coculture with bone marrow-derived stromal cells [termed
stromal derived induction activity (SDIA)] and subsequently
replated in defined media in the absence of stromal cells to
induce differentiation as described in refs. 24, 26, and 27. At the
neural precursor stage of the SDIA protocol, the cells were
transduced with lentiviral vectors that harbor Nurr1 and Pitx3,
both together, or control vector alone (GFP). The cells were then
cultured for 2 additional weeks and analyzed for the expression
of midbrain DA neuron maturation markers by RT-PCR and
immunohistochemistry.
The combination of Nurr1 and Pitx3 effectively promoted the
maturation of midbrain DA neurons derived from human ES
cells, as quantified by RT-PCR analysis of the expression of
midbrain DA markers including DAT, TH, the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (Vmat2), and dopa decarboxylase (Ddc)
(Fig. 2A). Nurr1 and Pitx3 cotransduction reduced the expression of non-dopaminergic neuronal fate markers, such as glutamic acid decarboxylase (Gad1), a marker for GABAergic
neurons, in the human ES cultures.
Nurr1 and Pitx3 cotransduction of SDIA differentiated human
ES cultures led to an increase in the number of TH-positive cells

corroborated by FACS analysis using a fluorescent ligand specific for the DAT, JHC 1–064 (22). Nurr1 and Pitx3 cotransduction increased the percentage of DAT-positive neurons
⬇3-fold over vector-transduced cells, from 15% to 45% (see
supporting information).
Analyses of additional markers for midbrain DA neurons in
the EB-differentiated cultures, as well as markers for other cell
phenotypes, indicated that Nurr1 and Pitx3 specifically instruct
midbrain DA neuron maturation. Thus, co-overexpression of
Nurr1 and Pitx3 induced late midbrain DA neuron maturation
markers such as DAT and tyrosinase-related protein 1 (Tyrp1)
(Fig. 1D) (23). In contrast, earlier phenotypic markers of midbrain DA neurons such as TH and aldehyde dehydrogenase-2
(Aldh2) appear induced by Nurr1 or Pitx3 alone, respectively
(Fig. 1 A and D). Global gene expression profiling of EBdifferentiated cultures transduced with Nurr1 and Pitx3 using
oligonucleotide microarrays indicated that the maturation markers DAT and Tyrp1 are among the most highly induced genes in
cells transduced with both Nurr1 and Pitx3 (within the top 0.1%
of annotated genes induced by the combined expression of Nurr1
and Pitx3; see supporting information).
Markers for other neuronal cell types, such as GABAergic
neurons (glutamic acid decarboxylase 1, Gad1) and serotonergic
neurons [tryptophan hydroxylase, Tph; serotonin transporter,
SERT (Slc6a4)], are not induced by Nurr1and Pitx3 overexpression (Fig. 1 C and D). Similarly, Nurr1 and Pitx3 overexpression
did not alter the overall number of neurons, as determined by the
neuron marker class III ␤-tubulin (TUJI) immunostaining (Fig.
1C) or total cell number (data not shown). En1 and Lmx1b, two
transcription factors that are normally expressed early at the
midbrain–hindbrain junction and serve as markers for the
identity of this region, are expressed in the majority of EBdifferentiated cells and appear unaltered by Nurr1 and Pitx3
transduction (see supporting information). Neuronal survival
and apoptosis, as quantified by staining with the Annexin V and
propidium iodide, is unchanged in the transduced cells (data not
shown).

ES cultures. (A) Human ES cells (H9) were differentiated by using the SDIA
method and transduced at the neural precursor stage with control vector

vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (Vmat2) using RT-PCR. GABAergic marker
(Gad1) expression appears reduced by Nurr1 plus Pitx3 cotransduction. (B and

number appeared unaltered, as quantified by TUJI immunostaining (Fig. 2 B and C). Similar results were observed with
Nurr1 and Pitx3 cotransduction in the context of EB differentiation of human H9 cells (see supporting information). Surprisingly, the human ES-derived, TH-positive cells appeared morphologically heterogeneous, with the majority of cells
coexpressing TUJI and exhibiting a typical polarized neuronal
morphology, but other cells (⬇25%) that appear broad or
spindle-shaped and lack TUJI staining (Fig. 2B). TH-expressing,
nonneuronal cells have previously been described in the context
of Nurr1 overexpression in murine ES cultures (15), but the
significance of these cells is unclear.
We sought to test functional neuronal properties of the human

either human or mouse ES cells (1 ⫻ 105 cells) at the neural precursor stage (see
Materials and Methods) that have been transduced with Nurr1, Pitx3, and GFP
lentiviral vectors (n ⫽ 5 mouse ES cells; n ⫽ 3 human ES cells) or control GFP
alone (mouse ES cells n ⫽ 4; human ES cells n ⫽ 3). Six weeks later, rotatory
behavior was quantified in response to apomorphine (0.4 mg兾kg) over a
30-min period. Data were statistically analyzed by using Fisher’s test (ANOVA).
(D) Engraftment of the human ES-derived transplants was assessed by immunostaining of striatal sections with antibodies for TH and the human-specific

analyses of the differentiated H9 ES cultures were performed by
using patch electrodes and current clamp techniques. These
studies indicated that the ES-derived cells display basic neuronal
characteristics, including depolarization-induced action potentials, burst firing, and miniature spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (Fig. 3B). The Nurr1- and Pitx3-transduced cells
did not differ from the control vector-transduced cells in terms
of basic neuronal excitability properties (data not shown), consistent with a specific role for Nurr1 and Pitx3 in induction of the
DA neuron phenotype.
Transplantion of Nurr1 and Pitx3 Overexpressing ES Cells. To inves-

tigate further the function of Nurr1- and Pitx3-transduced
ES-derived cultures in vivo, mouse or human ES cultures were
differentiated to the neural precursor stage (see Materials and
Methods) and transplanted into adult mice that had been lesioned with a unilateral intrastriatal injection of the DA neuron
toxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). In the absence of transplanted cells, lesioned animals display a characteristic contralateral turning behavior (away from the side of the lesion) when
exposed to the DA receptor agonist apomorphine as a result of
dennervation-induced hypersensitivity on the lesioned side (28).
Transplantation of human or mouse cells transduced with Pitx3
and Nurr1 led to a significantly greater reduction in this turning
behavior than did control vector-transduced cells at 6 weeks
after cell grafting (Fig. 3C). Lesioned animals that received

4; P⫹C). Nurr1 and Pitx3 extracts bound to complementary oligonucleotide
sequences from the human DAT promoter (arrow). DNA–protein complexes
were inhibited by competition with unlabeled wild-type (WT) complementary
oligonucleotides (lane 5, 3-fold excess unlabeled; lane 6, 10-fold excess) to a
greater extent than with mutant oligonucleotides (lane 7, 3-fold excess; lane
8, 10-fold excess). An additional band is observed in all lanes (asterisk).

either mouse or human ES-derived cells performed comparably
in the rotatory behavior assay.
Immunohistochemical analysis of brain sections with an antibody to human-specific nuclear antigen (HSNA) confirmed the
presence of engrafted human ES-derived cells at the site of
transplantation (Fig. 3D). However, cells within the core of the
graft were tightly packed and appeared to lack normal neuronal
process morphology. A low level of TH immunoreactivity could
be detected within the soma of transplanted cells transduced
with Nurr1 and Pitx3 (45% of HSNA-positive cells) (Fig. 4D),
but this was not significantly different from transplanted control
vector-transduced cells. These data are consistent with prior
transplantation studies that indicate limited maturation of engrafted human ES-derived cells (29–31).
Of note, at late time points (8 weeks after cell grafting),
three of the mice that received mouse ES cell transplants
developed apparent teratoma-like masses at the implantation
site (one transplanted with Nurr1 and Pitx3-transduced cells,
and two with control virus-transduced cells), consistent with a
prior study using murine mouse ES cell cultures (32). This
finding likely ref lects the presence of undifferentiated cells.
Martinat et al.

We hypothesized that the cooperative activity of Nurr1 and Pitx3
in midbrain DA neuron maturation may be a consequence of
cooperative transcriptional activation at midbrain DA neuronsspecific genes. Indeed, Nurr1 has previously been implicated in
the direct activation of DAT transcription (33). To quantify the
activities of Nurr1 and Pitx3 on DAT gene regulatory sequences,
a luciferase assay plasmid that harbors an 8.3-kb region upstream
of the human DAT gene was transfected into cells overexpressing either Nurr1, Pitx3, both, or neither. Nurr1 and Pitx3
cotransduction led to significantly higher levels of luciferase
expression than either factor alone in EB-differentiated mouse
ES cultures or COS7 monkey kidney cells (Fig. 4A). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Flag epitope-tagged
Nurr1 or untagged Pitx3 (Fig. 4B) indicated that these factors
bind directly to proximal regions of the endogenous DAT and
TH upstream regulatory sequences in vivo.
Sequence analysis of the promoter region of several midbrain
DA neuron-specific genes, including DAT (Fig. 4C) as well as
Tyrp1 and TH (data not shown) indicated the presence of
adjacent putative binding elements for Nurr1 and Pitx3, suggesting a cooperative activation mechanism. Consistent with this
observation, mutagenesis of these adjacent sites in the human
DAT promoter largely abrogated promoter activation by Nurr1
and Pitx3 in COS7 cells (Fig. 4D) and MM13 ES cultures (data
not shown). Finally, gel-shift assays with in vitro-translated
protein extracts show that Nurr1 and Pitx3 bind cooperatively to
oligonucleotides that harbor adjacent putative binding sites from
the proximal DAT promoter (Fig. 4E). Mutagenesis of conserved nucleotides within these sites inhibits competition. Taken
together, these data strongly support the notion that cooperative
DNA binding by Nurr1 and Pitx3 underlie the induction of
midbrain DA neurons maturation genes, and DAT in particular.
Of note, cooperativity between an orphan nuclear receptor and
a paired-like homeodomain protein has previously been described: Fushi Tarazu factor 1 (Ftz-F1) interacts with Fushi
Tarazu (Ftz) in the context of embryonic segmentation in
Drosophila (34, 35), and this interaction is conserved in vertebrate species (36).
Discussion
Our data, taken together with loss of function gene knockout
studies in rodents (2–4, 6–9), indicate that Pitx3 and Nurr1
cooperatively induce the late maturation of midbrain DA neurons. This cooperativity offers a potential mechanism for the
relatively cell-type-specific expression of late markers of midbrain DA neurons maturation. Thus, neither Nurr1 nor Pitx3
expression is strictly confined to midbrain DA neurons: Nurr1 is
expressed broadly in the brain during late development as well
as in other tissues, whereas Pitx3 is also expressed in the eye. The
region of expression overlap, however, is confined to midbrain
DA neuron.
We describe a network of transcription factors that cooperatively promote the maturation of ES cultures to the midbrain DA
neurons phenotype. Prior studies have provided evidence that
Nurr1 alone can promote an earlier stage in the differentiation
of murine ES cultures (14, 37). We extend this work to show that
Nurr1 and Pitx3 together induce the expression of a later
maturation step. Also, we demonstrate the feasibility of genetic
modification of human ES cultures to promote the generation of
midbrain DA neurons. We posit that coexpression of Nurr1 and
Pitx3 may significantly enhance the efficacy of cell-replacement
therapies for Parkinson’s disease, and in particular human
ES-derived cell approaches.

Evidence for Cooperative Transcription Activation by Nurr1 and Pitx3.

It is of particular interest to extend the in vitro analysis of
Nurr1 and Pitx3 cotransduced human ES cultures to in vivo
transplantation models. Prior studies have reported limited
success with ES-derived grafts (29 –31); Ben-Hur et al. reported significant functional rescue in a 6-OHDA rat lesion
model, but the percentage of TH-positive cells in the grafts
were low. We find that Nurr1 and Pitx3 cotransduced H9 ES
cells can ameliorate pathological rotator y behavior in
6-OHDA unilaterally lesioned mice, but DA neuron maturation appears incomplete in the grafts, suggesting that additional inductive factors may be necessary in vivo. Alternatively,
an inhibitory factor for DA neuron maturation or survival may
exist in the adult striatum. Additional studies are needed to
address the limited engraftment of human ES cultures in
transplantation models.
Materials and Methods
Generation of DY-1 ES Cells. Homozygous ‘‘knock-in’’ mice that

harbor the Cre recombinase gene at the DAT locus were bred
with mice in which a Cre-inducible EYFP f luorescent marker
gene was ‘‘knocked-in’’ at the ROSA26 locus (38 – 40) to obtain
double-transgenic blastocysts. An ES cell line (DY-1) was
derived from these blastocysts by using standard techniques
(41). This cell line was demonstrated to be totipotent by
injection into blastocysts and germline transmission (data not
shown).
ES Cells Culture and in Vitro Differentiation. Mouse ES cells (MM13
or DY-1) were propagated and differentiated as described in
refs. 18 and 42. Human ES cell line H9 (passages 30–45) was
cultured on mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEF) (Specialty Media). Undifferentiated hES cells were
maintained under growth conditions and passaging techniques
as described in ref. 24. Differentiation of hES cells into DA
neurons was performed by using the SDIA method (24) (see
supporting information).
Recombinant Lentiviral Vectors. The recombinant lentiviral vectors

are described in refs. 19 and 42–44. Nurr1 and Pitx3 cDNAs were
cloned by standard PCR methods from a human cDNA library.
Lmx1b was cloned from a chick cDNA library. For the viral
transduction, single cell-suspensions (1 ⫻ 105 cells) were infected
at a multiplicity of infection of 1:1.
Immunocytochemistry and in Situ Hybridization. Cultured cells were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and were incubated with
the primary antibodies at 4°C for 12 h. The following primary
antibodies were used: mouse anti-TUJ1 (Covance; dilution
1兾500), rabbit anti-TH (Pel-Freez; dilution 1兾1,000), sheep
anti-TH (Pel-Freez; dilution 1兾1,000), rat anti-DAT (Chemicon;
dilution 1兾500), rabbit anti-GABA (Chemicon; dilution
1兾1,000), rabbit anti-5HT (Sigma; dilution 1兾5,000), and rabbit
anti-GFP (Molecular Probes; dilution 1兾1,000). Appropriate
FITC and Cy3- and Cy5-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson
ImmunoResearch) were used. In situ hybridization was performed by using Lmx1b and Engrailed-1 probes as described in
ref. 45.
Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR. Total RNA from ES cells differentiated was prepared by using the absolutely RNA Miniprep kit
(Stratagene). cDNA was synthesized by using SuperScript (Invitrogen). RT-PCRs were optimized to determine the linear
amplification range by using a Stratagene MX3000P system with
QuantiTect PCR mix (Qiagen).
HPLC and Electrophysiology Analysis. Extracellular DA levels were

measured by HPLC as described in ref. 42.
Human ES cells cultured as described were used for recording

under ruptured whole-cell voltage and current clamp modes by
using standard techniques. The miniature spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents were recorded under voltage clamp
(holding potential of ⫺60 mV) in the presence of 0.5 mM
tetrodotoxin in the bath solution, and the action potential and
spontaneous firing were recorded under current clamp. Action
potentials were induced by a brief depolarization step (50–150
pA, 100 ms).
6-OHDA Lesioning, Transplantation, and Behavioral Analysis. Procedures involving animal care were in conformity with the Columbia University Animal Protocols and in compliance with the
guidelines of the National Institutes of Health. Adult male CD-1
mice (6–8 weeks; Charles River Breeding Laboratories) were
anaesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (60 mg兾kg and 10
mg兾kg, respectively) and placed in a stereotactic frame (Stoelting). The DA denervation was achieved by stereotactic injection
of 6-OHDA (4 ␮l; 2 mg兾ml in normal saline with 0.02% ascorbic
acid; Sigma) in the left striatum (anterior 1 mm; lateral 2.2 mm;
ventral 3 mm, as determined from the bregma and the skull
surface). Turning behavior before the cell transplantation was
187.9 ⫾ 62.55 turns per 30 min.
Stage 3 EB-differentiated human or mouse ES cells were
transduced with GFP or Nurr1兾Pitx3兾GFP lentiviruses and then
injected (1 ⫻ 105 cells per ␮l) in the striatum. Apomorphineinduced turning behavior was assessed at 2 weeks after the
6-OHDA injection and before grafting, and again 6 weeks after
the cell grafting (28). Mice were placed in hemispheric bowls and
left for 20 min to habituate to the new environment. Apomorphine was injected s.c. (0.4 mg兾kg). Mice were videotaped, and
the number of turns was counted over a 30-min period by an
independent observer blinded to the experimental design. One
animal that had been transplanted with control vectortransduced mouse ES cells displayed severe contralateral barrel
rotations in response to 0.4 mg兾kg apomorphine (consistent with
the apparent low efficacy of the control cells), but these could
not be accurately quantified in this assay, and this animal was
therefore not included in the statistical analysis. Additionally, in
two animals transplanted with human ES cells (1 GFP and 1
Nurr1兾Pitx3), the stereotaxic surgery was not successful and no
engraftment was visualized by GFP fluorescence; these were not
included in further analyses. Six weeks after transplantation,
animals were killed and perfused with 10 ml of saline followed
by 35 ml of a 4% solution of paraformaldehyde. Brains were
extracted and immunostained as described in ref. 42.
Luciferase Assays, Chromatin Immunoprecipitations, and Gel-Shift
Analysis. For luciferase assays, cells were transfected using Li-

pofectamine (Invitrogen) with a firefly luciferase assay plasmid
harboring either DAT regulatory sequences or control along
with a Renilla luciferase vector as internal control. Forty-eight
hours after transfection, cell extracts were analyzed for firefly
luciferase activity and normalized with Renilla luciferase activity
(Promega), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation analyses were carried out as described in
ref. 46. DNA–protein complexes were immunoprecipitated by
using agarose-conjugated anti-Flag antibodies (Sigma) or an
antibody to Pitx3 (Chemicon). Electrophoretic mobility-shift
assays (EMSA) were performed by using an EMSA kit (Novagen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
