Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a major cause of death and disability in developed countries. Brain injuries are highly
heterogeneous and can also trigger other neurological complications, including epilepsy, depression and dementia. The initial
injury often leads to the development of secondary sequelae; cellular hyperexcitability, vasogenic and cytotoxic oedema,
hypoxia-ischaemia, oxidative stress and inflammation, all of which influence expansion of the primary lesion. It is widely
known that inflammatory events in the brain following TBI contribute to the widespread cell death and chronic tissue
degeneration. Neuroinflammation is a multifaceted response involving a number of cell types, both within the CNS and in the
peripheral circulation. Astrocytes and microglia, cells of the CNS, are considered key players in initiating an inflammatory
response after injury. These cells are capable of secreting various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, and following
injury to the CNS, undergo changes in morphology. Ultimately, these changes can influence the local microenvironment and
thus determine the extent of damage and subsequent repair. This review will focus on the roles of microglia and astrocytes
following TBI, highlighting some of the key processes, pathways and mediators involved in this response. Additionally, both
the beneficial and the detrimental aspects of these cellular responses will be examined using evidence from animal models
and human post-mortem TBI studies.

Introduction
The pathology of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is complex and
multifactorial, with TBIs commonly categorized into primary
and secondary injuries. Primary injury results from mechanical disruption of brain tissue, often resulting in axonal shearing and can lead to the formation of contusions and
haemorrhage (Werner and Engelhard, 2007). As a result of
these events, a secondary cascade of molecular and biochemical changes is initiated within minutes of the initial impact,
termed secondary injury. Secondary injury processes, such as
excitotoxicity, ischaemia, apoptosis, necrosis and inflammation, are critical in determining the extent of injury expansion and damage to brain tissue following the primary insult
(Greve and Zink, 2009). Much of the research and studies
performed in the field of TBI are focused on targeting various
aspects of the secondary injury cascade in order to control
cell death and tissue degeneration post-injury; however, most
have demonstrated limited translational success (Menon,
2009).
Neuroinflammation is as a major pathological process in
the secondary response after TBI (Cederberg and Siesjo,
2010). This inflammatory response is designated the term
‘sterile inflammation’ or inflammation in the absence of a
pathogenic stimulus and involves multiple cell types within
the CNS (Rock et al., 2010). Furthermore, brain injury compromises the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), a
physical barrier separating the brain parenchyma from the
body’s circulation (Rodriguez-Baeza et al., 2003; Shlosberg
et al., 2010). Injury-induced BBB damage allows infiltration of
blood-borne cells, adding a layer of complexity to the neuroinflammatory response (Beschorner et al., 2002; Jin et al.,
2012). Moreover, increased permeability of the BBB after
injury allows passage of both small and large molecules into
the brain (Habgood et al., 2007).

In addition to the peripheral response, dying or damaged
cells within the lesional and peri-lesional areas in the brain
release cellular debris into the microenvironment, priming
local microglia and astrocytes. These resident cells express a
variety of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) at their cell
surface and intracellularly, allowing them to mount an
immune response (Gorina et al., 2011; Holm et al., 2012; de
Rivero Vaccari et al., 2012; Fellner et al., 2013). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a class of membrane-bound PRRs, which are
activated by a variety of endogenous pathogen-associ ated
molecular patterns or danger-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs), including dsDNA and RNA, CpG motifs and chaperone proteins. These molecules are released by pathogens, or
in the case of brain injury, dying cells (Anderson, 2000).
Signalling through TLRs can also induce the production of
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, allowing them to
signal to cells within damaged tissue, and potentially exacerbate the neuroinflammatory cascade (Lafon et al., 2006;
Goodall et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014). Importantly, neurons also
express TLRs, allowing them to respond to, and mount, a
TLR-driven inflammatory response (Lafon et al., 2006).
The brain’s innate response to injury is crucial; resident
astrocytes and microglia are often the primary cell types to
initiate an inflammatory cascade upon sensing danger, and
proteins associated with the activation of these cells are often
used as biomarkers in TBI (Hernandez-Ontiveros et al., 2013;
Diaz-Arrastia et al., 2014). Their responses include, but are
not limited to, secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, barrier formation
around lesional areas, phagocytosis of dying cells and cellular
debris, and modulation of cellular responses.
Reactive astrocytes, for example, can influence the
responses of other cell types after TBI, both within the brain
and in the periphery. Ablation of reactive astrocytes has
resulted in an increase in leukocyte infiltration in a stab

wound injury model, leading to neurodegeneration (Bush
et al., 1999). Contrasting evidence suggest that the glial cellmediated invasion of peripheral cells can also be considered a
mechanism of protection in a hippocampal entorhinodentate lesion model (Babcock et al., 2003).
Pleiotropic responses of glial cells have been shown to
facilitate both inflammation resolution and exacerbation
(Johnson et al., 2013; Roth et al., 2014). Because of this, a
better understanding of the nature of the inflammatory
response generated by astrocytes and microglia will aid in
developing therapies to combat cell death and degeneration,
and protect viable brain tissue after TBI. The inflammatory
responses of both astrocytes and microglia will be discussed
in this review, with an examination of the dual nature of
these responses, and how these cells modulate the surrounding environment after brain injury.

Astrocytes
Astrocytes form part of the macroglia, cell types comprising
oligodendrocytes, radial glia and ependymal cells (Kimelberg
and Nedergaard, 2010). They are critical in maintaining
physiological homeostasis within the CNS, with important
roles in supporting neuronal function, glial transmission and
signalling via Ca2+ release and uptake (Chen and Swanson,
2003). Studies have reported that human cortical astrocytes
displayed a greater degree of heterogeneity and complexity
than their rodent counterparts (Oberheim et al., 2009;
Sosunov et al., 2014). Furthermore, astrocytes isolated from
human temporal neocortex were larger than rodent astrocytes and capable of transmitting Ca2+ waves much faster
than rodent astrocytes (Oberheim et al., 2009). These studies
indicate that human astrocytes appear to be much more
complex than those in the rodent brain. However, the study
of astrocytes after injuries such as TBI is most commonly
performed in rodents due to the ease of manipulating pathways and mediators in these models.
Astrocytes also play a role in maintaining BBB integrity,
by forming astrocytic end feet around endothelial cells (Risau
and Wolburg, 1990; Abbott et al., 2006). Astrocytic interactions with endothelial cells are a critical component of the
induction and maintenance of the BBB (see Abbott et al.,
2006) and involve processes such as inter- and intra-cellular
communication. Disruption of the BBB is associated with
high levels of secreted factors from damaged tissue, such as
S100B protein (used as a marker of BBB leakage) and MMP
(Vajtr et al., 2009). Additionally, other mediators can influence the integrity of the BBB. For example, bradykinininduced astrocytic secretion of IL-6 leads to opening of the
BBB (Schwaninger et al., 1999). It is suggested that BBB breakdown follows a biphasic pattern after injury, with an initial
increase in permeability hours after TBI, and declining thereafter, and a secondary delayed phase 3–7 days following
injury, as found in controlled cortical impact (CCI) and
closed head injury models (Shapira et al., 1993; Baskaya et al.,
1997). Damage to the BBB after injury can also cause infiltration of peripheral immune cells (Jin et al., 2012). These cells
are thought to play roles in repair but can also exacerbate
neuroinflammation in the secondary phase of injury. The
role of peripheral cells in injury is extensive and is outside the
694

scope of this review. Therefore, this review will focus specifically on astrocytes and microglia in TBI.

Astrocytes and brain injury
An increase in astrocyte reactivity in response to injury is
termed astrogliosis (Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010). This
response involves changes in morphology, increased expression of the intermediate filament proteins, glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin, heightened proliferation
and secretion of inflammatory mediators and growth factors
(Pekny et al., 1999; Gorina et al., 2011; Zamanian et al., 2012;
Paintlia et al., 2013). Many of these factors act in an autocrine
and paracrine fashion to facilitate astrocytic reactivity of the
cells surrounding them. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that FGF serves as an inhibitory molecule in rendering
astrocytes reactive, both in resting states and after stab
wound injury (Kang et al., 2014). This body of work indicates
the delicate balance between reactivity and suppression of
function in astrocytes after injury.
Reactive astrocytes can acquire a hypertrophic morphology after injury, involving extension of processes and swelling of cell bodies. A recent study conducted in a mouse CCI
model reported hypertrophic astrocytes in the lesional and
peri-lesional area 3 days after TBI (Villapol et al., 2014).
Further changes in morphology were evident 7 days after
injury, with glial scar formation. Reactive gliosis was maintained up to 60 days after injury in this model, demonstrating
an ongoing response of astrocytes to brain injury.
Excitotoxicity is another common mechanism of secondary brain injury after TBI (Palmer et al., 1993). It is appreciated that while neurons are highly vulnerable to
excitotoxicity, astrocytes have key roles in the re-uptake of
glutamate from synapses, preventing excessive extracellular
glutamate accumulation (Chen and Swanson, 2003). Glutamate transporters, such as EAAT1 and EAAT2, are essential for
glutamate re-uptake. It has been demonstrated that blocking
these transporters on astrocytes by administering antisense
oligonucleotides in rats resulted in increased extracellular
glutamate concentration, leading to excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration (Rothstein et al., 1996). Human TBI studies
have observed decreases in glial expression of EAAT1 and
EAAT2 after TBI in lesional and peri-lesional areas, suggesting
down-regulation of these transporters after TBI (van
Landeghem et al., 2006; Beschorner et al., 2007). This suggests that astrocytic down-regulation in humans after TBI
promotes accumulation of glutamate in extracellular areas
and may contribute to excessive excitotoxicity leading to
neurodegeneration.
Glial scar formation is commonly seen post-injury and
consists largely of astrocytes, along with microglia, endothelial cells and fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (Silver and
Miller, 2004). Several mediators have been implicated in
inducing glial scar formation, including TGF-β1 and TGF-2,
IFN-γ, FGF and fibrinogen (DiProspero et al., 1997; Moon and
Fawcett, 2001; Schachtrup et al., 2010). Knock-out mice
studies have also demonstrated a role for GFAP and vimentin
in proper glial scar formation (Pekny et al., 1999;
Wilhelmsson et al., 2004). Scarring is thought to act as a
physical barrier to encapsulate damaged tissue in order to
prevent toxic molecules and DAMPs from leaking out into
healthy tissue and to prevent access to invading cell types

Neuroinflammation and TBI

after injury. It has however also been shown to have an
inhibitory effect on axonal regrowth and regeneration
(Ribotta et al., 2004; Silver and Miller, 2004).
Another prominent aspect of astrogliosis is the ability of
astrocytes to migrate or proliferate towards lesional or
damaged tissue. The proliferative capacity of astrocytes as
part of the injury-induced response has been extensively
studied in a stab wound model of injury, where the lesion is
induced in the somatosensory cortex (Bardehle et al., 2013).
Using two-photon laser scanning microscopy, GFP-labelled
astrocytes were found to up-regulate GFAP expression and
display elongated processes and enlarged cell bodies, indicative of hypertrophy at 7 days post-injury. Interestingly, proliferation rather than migration of astrocytes was detected at
5–7 days post-injury. In a mouse CCI model, GFAP-positive
astrocytes were found to proliferate at 1, 3 and 7 days postinjury, with numbers of proliferating astrocytes peaking 3
days post-injury (Susarla et al., 2014). These astrocytes were
located in close proximity to the lesion and were hypertrophic with extended processes. These studies demonstrate a
predominant proliferative response in astrocytes, which
peaks in the acute phase after experimental TBI. Collectively,
these studies point to a critical role of astrocytes in modulating barrier formation, secretion of inflammatory factors and
glial scar formation after injury. Additionally, astrocytes can
elicit both protective and deleterious actions, which can
influence the extent of brain damage or repair after injury.

Damage versus repair: dual roles of astrocytes
following brain injury
Astrogliosis has been defined in the context of both neuroprotection and neurodegeneration (Myer et al., 2006;
Zamanian et al., 2012). Reactive astrocytes are capable of producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and MMP
that degrade the extracellular matrix and cause further BBB
disruption (Carpentier et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2005).
However, astrocytes are also capable of producing factors to
support repair and regeneration after CNS damage (Kim et al.,
2010; Madathil et al., 2013).
Specific roles of reactive astrocytes have been studied in
models of moderate and severe CCI TBI (Myer et al., 2006).
Selective ablation of proliferating reactive astrocytes allows
researchers to elucidate their roles (Bush et al., 1999; Myer
et al., 2006). In mice, the removal of proliferating reactive
astrocytes resulted in neuronal degeneration and inflammation, and thus, has confirmed their essential role in preserving neuronal tissue after moderate, but not severe TBI (Myer
et al., 2006). Furthermore, reactive astrocytes were shown to
have a critical role in preventing the infiltration of inflammatory cells in regions containing intact cortical neurons.
However, in direct contrast, blocking astrocytic proliferation
using agents that disrupt various stages of the cell cycle leads
to reduced neuronal cell death after fluid percussion injury in
rats (Di Giovanni et al., 2005). Reduced astrocytic proliferation was also accompanied by reduced glial scar formation,
microglial activation and improved histological and cognitive outcome after TBI, suggesting that the presence of reactive astrocytes can create an environment permissive to
degeneration.
Factors secreted from reactive astrocytes can influence
their actions and thus could explain the discrepancy between

studies observing favourable roles versus those finding damaging roles for reactive astrocytes. For instance, astrocytespecific overexpression of the growth factor IGF-1 resulted in
increased gliosis accompanied by reduced hippocampal
neurodegeneration after CCI injury (Madathil et al., 2013).
Interestingly, astrocyte-specific overexpression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 also resulted in increased wound
healing concurrently with increased reactive gliosis (Penkowa
et al., 2003; Quintana et al., 2008). In contrast, astrocytespecific deletion of a Ca2+-dependent N cadherin demonstrated a crucial role for this protein in mediating astrogliosis
and consequent neurodegeneration (Kanemaru et al., 2013).
These studies highlight the diversity of reactive gliosis
and how the loss or gain of a single factor in reactive astrocytes can influence inflammatory responses and neuronal
outcome.
Additionally, responses of astrocytes can be dependent
upon their ability to assume different morphologies and phenotypes. Astrocytic heterogeneity was observed in a study
examining the role of astrocytes after LPS injury and midcerebral artery occlusion (Zamanian et al., 2012). LPS-injured
astrocytes assumed deleterious phenotypes, while astrocytes
in the brains of mice subjected to mid-cerebral artery occlusion assume reparative phenotypes. It is possible that after
TBI, heterogeneous groups of astrocytes also emerge. Accumulating evidence from morphological and genetic studies
reveals that astrocytes can acquire different morphologies
and up-regulate activation markers in varying levels after
brain injury (Hill et al., 1996; Bardehle et al., 2013;
Martin-Lopez et al., 2013). Astrocytic responses are influenced by their location with respect to the injury, the signals
they receive from their environment and also factors during
their development (Martin-Lopez et al., 2013).
Astrocytes have also been found to affect microglial
responses. In a stab wound TBI model, impaired astrocyte
recruitment after depletion of the RhoGTPase Cdc42 resulted
in increased microglial activation (Robel et al., 2011). Additionally, increased astrocyte activation in an in vitro oxygenglucose deprivation model influenced the production of
anti-inflammatory mediators and suppressed microglial
activation (Kim et al., 2010). These responses imply that
microglia can heighten their activity as a compensatory
mechanism for depleted astrocytic numbers, and conversely,
excessive activation of astrocytes can dampen microglial
responses. It is evident from these studies that astrocytes can
affect the local environment after TBI, either in concert with,
or by affecting neighbouring cells. Indeed, like astrocytes,
microglial cells play instrumental roles in shaping the microenvironment after TBI.

Microglia
Microglia are specialized immune cells of the brain with
phagocytic and antigen-presenting capabilities (Hickey and
Kimura, 1988). Originating from mesodermal cells of the yolk
sac, microglia are derived from erythromyeloid precursor
cells, and recently, their development has been shown to be
dependent upon the transcription factors Pu.1 and interferon
regulatory factor-8 (Ginhoux et al., 2010; Kierdorf et al.,
2013). There is a large degree of heterogeneity in microglial

structure and shape, depending upon their activation state.
Broadly, microglia are described as ‘ramified’ when in a
resting or quiescent state (Glenn et al., 1992). Upon activation, microglia can transform to a hypertrophic or bushy
morphology (Tambuyzer et al., 2009). Additionally, microglia
are described as acquiring an amoeboid morphology during
early stages of development or when actively phagocytosing
cellular debris. In the healthy brain, microglia are often
described as ‘resting’, although they are constantly surveying
their environment in preparation for insult or injury
(Nimmerjahn et al., 2005). Additionally, microglia are also
capable of pruning synapses on neighbouring neurons during
development by direct engulfment, thus serving a homeostatic function (Paolicelli et al., 2011).
Microglia express a variety of molecules at their cell
surface, thus allowing their identification, and in certain
cases, distinction from peripheral macrophages. Microglia
are Mac 1/CD11b+ CD45low-expressing cells, whereas
macrophages are Mac-1/CD11b+ CD45high-expressing cells
(D’Mello et al., 2009). The recent development of CCR2-RFP
knock-in mice crossed with CX3CR1-GFP mice has allowed
the differentiation of monocytes from microglia (Saederup
et al., 2010). Additionally, microglia express high levels of the
chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, and the intracellular Ca2+binding protein, ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1
(Iba-1) (Fukuda et al., 1996; Nishiyori et al., 1998). Microglia
in activated states up-regulate the expression of Iba-1, which
can occur in cases of infection or injury to the CNS. Additionally, CD68 (ED1) is also used as a marker to confirm
microglial activation (Graeber et al., 1990), and CD68 immunoreactivity is observed after both mouse and human TBI
(Frugier et al., 2010; Loane et al., 2014). Following CNS
trauma, microglia undergo morphological changes and can
secrete a variety of factors, which either exacerbate or limit
tissue damage.

Microglia in TBI
Microglia are instrumental in mounting an immune response
after TBI. A study investigating pathological changes in
injured post-mortem human brains showed a prolonged and
persistent activation of microglia, which was present even
years after injury (Johnson et al., 2013). With chronic trauma,
patients displayed increased levels of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II molecule CR3/43 and CD68
on activated microglia compared with acutely injured and
non-injured controls. In addition, increased white matter
degeneration and disruption of myelinated fibres were associated with the chronic cohort of patients, clearly demonstrating an association between chronic microglial activation
after injury and neurodegeneration.
Similarly, in a mouse CCI model, neuropathological and
inflammatory changes were monitored up to 1 year after
experimental TBI (Loane et al., 2014). Microglia were chronically activated, with increased levels of Iba-1, CD68 and the
MHC Class II molecule CR3/43 compared with controls. Morphology was assessed as being hypertrophic or bushy. This
was accompanied with lesion expansion, loss of hippocampal
neurons, white matter damage and loss of myelin. This study
is corroborated by earlier work that reported the presence of
mononuclear phagocytes in injured rat brains 3 months after
weight-drop injury, along with an up-regulation in MHC
696

Class II and the release of IL-1β and TNF-α (Holmin and
Mathiesen, 1999). These smaller scale studies in rodents
confirm the results found in the longitudinal study in
humans, demonstrating the presence of chronically activated
microglia and tissue degeneration after injury.
Evidence from alternative TBI models suggests that microglia have various roles after injury, adding to the complexity
of microglial responses in the context of brain injury. In a
novel closed head injury model, it was revealed that skull
thinning and compression in mice resulted in cell death of
the meningeal layers (Roth et al., 2014). This was associated
with an extension of microglial processes surrounding the
lesion and microglia surrounding dying astrocytes in the glial
limitans. The microglial response was found to be dependent
upon purinergic signalling, and blocking this signalling
resulted in increased permeability of the glial limitans and
subsequent cell death around the meninges. Similarly, in a
laser-induced focal injury model, the microglial response was
determined to be dependent upon ATP release and activation
of P2Y receptors (Davalos et al., 2005). In response to injury,
it was established that ATP mediated extension of microglial
processes to surround the injury site, allowing a barrier to be
formed between damaged and intact tissues. Together, these
significant studies emphasize that the microglial response in
injury can be dependent upon context and injury severity
(highlighted through the use of different injury models), and
therefore, a better understanding of the pleiotropic nature of
these responses is needed to advance our understanding of
microglial contribution in injury.

The dual nature of the microglial response;
M1 and M2 phenotypes
The microglial response in TBI is dualistic; highly dependent
upon timing and the nature of the injury itself. Macrophages/
microglia can acquire heterogeneous phenotypes following
CNS insult in response to varying environmental cues. These
cells are ascribed the nomenclature of ‘M1’ or ‘M2’, with
varying classes of M2 cells (Mantovani and Locati, 2009; Sica
and Mantovani, 2012). Additionally, the terms ‘classical activation’ for M1, ‘alternative activation (M2a)’ and ‘acquired
deactivation (M2c)’ are commonly used to group microglia
(Cao et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2013). Cells polarize from a
‘resting’ or ‘M0’ phenotype into an M1 phenotype after LPS
or IFN-γ exposure and are considered neurotoxic following
CNS injury (Kigerl et al., 2009). It has been suggested that M1
microglia exhibit reduced phagocytosing capability compared with M0 microglia in response to oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro, and M2 exhibit increased activity (Hu et al.,
2012; Wang et al., 2013). In contrast, an M2 phenotype is
acquired following exposure to IL-4 or IL-13, and these cells
are considered neuroprotective (Kigerl et al., 2009). M1
microglia are known to produce mediators such as proinflammatory cytokines and inducible NOS to elicit their
deleterious effects, and M2 microglia produce scavenger
receptors, growth factors such as TGF-β and the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 (Figure 1). As such, these mediators or cell surface receptors for corresponding M1 and M2
cells are used as markers to broadly differentiate the two cell
types in injury states. Table 1 lists the different markers used
to study M1/M2 polarization following TBI.

Neuroinflammation and TBI

Figure 1
Diagrammatic representation of M1/M2 polarization in microglia. For simplicity, M2 microglia have been represented as just the one phenotype,
as opposed to illustrating the various classes. Cellular debris and other mediators released by dying neurons after injury prime microglia. An
environment rich with the classical pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as IFN-γ and LPS, promotes the polarization of resting microglia into an M1
phenotype. M1 microglia release pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and iNOS. An M1 environment is neurotoxic, facilitating white matter
injury and cell death. In contrast, a neuroinflammatory environment rich in anti-inflammatory IL-4 or IL-13 drives the development of an M2
phenotype. M2 microglia release IL-10 and TGF-β, while promoting repair and inflammation resolution. In addition to microglia, peripherally
infiltrating macrophages can also undergo polarization into M1 and M2 phenotypes, and recently, this has shown to be true of neutrophils in a
murine ischaemic stroke model (Cuartero et al., 2013).

There is still some debate over the use of specific markers
to distinguish M1 and M2 cells. Furthermore, the grouping of
cells into ‘M1’ and ‘M2’ categories is not a unanimous view;
there are reports suggesting that macrophage/microglial
polarization fits onto a spectrum rather than into two distinct
groups (reviewed in Mosser and Edwards, 2008). These conflicting reports may be a reflection of the studies, with
changes observed in whole tissue specimens rather than in
specific cell types (Kumar et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013).
Many studies therefore describe microglial polarization as
being skewed towards either an ‘M1-like’ or ‘M2-like’ state.
Additionally, it is possible that that M1/M2 polarization may
be reversible, as previously polarized cells may be able to
transform to different phenotypes depending upon the presence of additional environmental stimuli (Butovsky et al.,
2005; Schwartz et al., 2006). Furthermore, cells may be undergoing phenotypic switches when isolated, influencing levels
of receptors/marker proteins. A recent review has addressed

complexities regarding macrophage nomenclature (Murray
et al., 2014). It is suggested that researchers use more standardized methods of isolation and use a wider range of markers
to designate categories for polarized macrophages. Recently,
using a direct RNA sequencing technique, a unique set of
genes, termed the ‘microglial sensome’, was identified in
microglia isolated from aged mice (Hickman et al., 2013).
Furthermore, microglial-specific genes that were up-regulated
during classical and alternative microglial priming were identified in both young and aged mice, allowing a greater understanding of microglial polarization states. Evidently, similar
such studies in microglia after TBI are warranted and will
increase our knowledge of microglial-specific polarization following injury. As such, the M1/M2 paradigm is no doubt an
evolving one; and as new evidence comes to light, these
categories and definitions will be subject to re-evaluation.
Studies performed in CCI models indicate that the onset
of activation varies significantly between M1 and M2 microBritish Journal of Pharmacology (2016) 173 692–702

glia (Jin et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). By qPCR and immunohistochemistry, Wang et al. demonstrated an immediately
increased and transient M2-like environment after TBI, in
contrast to the delayed but slightly more prolonged M1-like
environment (Wang et al., 2013). However, in the absence of
cell-specific markers, it was suggested that this environment
could be attributed to both microglial and macrophage populations. However, in distinguishing resident microglia from
peripheral macrophages by assessing CD45/CD11B and Iba-1
expression, Jin et al. confirmed a similar pattern of M1/M2
activation with an initial and transient M2 peak, followed by
a predominant M1 response at 21 days post-injury (Jin et al.,
2012). Specifically, microglial numbers followed a multiphasic pattern, with increased levels 7 days post-injury, a decrease
in microglial numbers 14 days post-injury and, finally, a
gradual increase after 21 days. The exact period of activation
differed slightly between these studies, perhaps reflecting the
different methods of analysis of M1/M2 populations.
Evidence from stroke models also suggests that there is a
propensity for an M2-favoured environment early after
injury, followed by a delayed onset of M1 microglia/
macrophages in vivo (Hu et al., 2012). These results are also
observed with astrocyte populations after ischaemic stroke,
suggesting the presence of beneficial and detrimental subsets
of astrocyte, with a protective astrocytic phenotype observed
in a murine stroke model (Zamanian et al., 2012). Collectively, this body of evidence suggests the need to further
characterize the polarization properties of microglia specifically rather than in whole brain specimens. The studies
reviewed here provide evidence for M1/M2 environments in
the brain following injury, and when combined with information about the specific phenotypic changes of microglia
exclusively, a greater understanding of M1/M2 dynamics following brain injury will be achieved. Additionally, studies
that selectively investigate microglial properties following

injury will aid our understanding of the exact nature and
timing of both beneficial and detrimental microglial
responses following injury.

Discussion
It is clear that the diverse roles of astrocytes and microglia in
TBI arise as a result of divergent stimuli they receive from the
surrounding cells and the local microenvironment. Substrates
produced in injury, such as inflammatory mediators, proteases, complement factors and DAMPs, trigger complex cascades, promoting a variety of cellular responses. Importantly,
responses of astrocytes and microglia in experimental TBI
studies can be largely dependent upon the nature and severity of injury; focal models, such as stab wound models, can
induce different responses in these cells compared with
diffuse models, such as weight-drop injury. This is highlighted nicely in the suite of microglial studies, which demonstrated both reparative and deleterious roles for these cells
in various models of experimental TBI (Davalos et al., 2005;
Loane et al., 2014; Roth et al., 2014). Studies investigating
responses of reactive glial cells must therefore take this into
account and ideally incorporate results from more than just
one TBI model. Additionally, the outcomes of glial responses
depend upon both environmental cues and other cell types,
emphasizing the complex nature of reactive gliosis in injury.
Studies of reactive astro- and microgliosis have identified
somewhat opposing roles in injury: those promoting neurotoxicity and degeneration and those promoting repair and
regeneration. Microglia are not exclusive in their ability to
polarize into different phenotypes; recently, it has been
shown that astrocytes can assume both pro-repair and prodamage phenotypes depending upon their stimulus, and
accordingly, these astrocytes up-regulate phenotype-specific

Neuroinflammation and TBI

markers (Zamanian et al., 2012). The identification of glial
polarization in the context of brain injuries is crucial in
advancing our understanding of glial heterogeneity, thereby
allowing us to manipulate these properties to limit damage
and support regeneration following TBI.
It is important to note that these cellular responses may
not occur in isolation. Although not extensively discussed
within this review, cells within the brain can act in concert
with recruited haematopoietic cells after injury to exert their
biological function. Signals released by microglia, for
example, have been shown to recruit monocytes into the
brain in response to peripheral organ inflammation (D’Mello
et al., 2009). Neuroimmune crosstalk is emerging as a critical
concept in studies of brain injury and stroke, and the use of
chimeric mice and the selective depletion of brain-derived or
peripheral cells is allowing investigators to tease apart the
roles of these different cell types (Gliem et al., 2012; Downes
et al., 2013; Low et al., 2014).
Therapies targeting CNS injuries must take into account
the multifaceted nature of cellular responses if they are going
to be effective in limiting neuronal damage after TBI. Inflammatory responses of astrocytes and microglia in TBI represent
an interesting therapeutic opportunity. By harnessing the
protective or reparative effects of these responses while simultaneously dampening their deleterious effects, we may be
able to control the progression and exacerbation of inflammation and protect viable brain tissue. Therefore, a greater
understanding of the mechanisms governing reactive gliosis
and how gliosis affects other cell types will aid in the development of better therapeutics for TBI.
