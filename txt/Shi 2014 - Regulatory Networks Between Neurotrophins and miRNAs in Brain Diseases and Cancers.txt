miRNAs in brain diseases and cancers

Neurotrophins are involved in many physiological and pathological processes in the nervous system. They regulate and modify signal
transduction, transcription and translation in neurons. It is recently demonstrated that the neurotrophin expression is regulated by
microRNAs (miRNAs), changing our views on neurotrophins and miRNAs. Generally, miRNAs regulate neurotrophins and their receptors
in at least two ways: (1) miRNAs bind directly to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of isoform-specific mRNAs and post-transcriptionally
regulate their expression; (2) miRNAs bind to the 3′ UTR of the regulatory factors of neurotrophins and regulate their expression. On
the other hand, neurotrophins can regulate miRNAs. The results of BNDF research show that neurotrophins regulate miRNAs in
at least three ways: (1) ERK stimulation enhances the activation of TRBP (HIV-1 TAR RNA-binding protein) and Dicer, leading to the
upregulation of miRNA biogenesis; (2) ERK-dependent upregulation of Lin28a (RNA-binding proteins) blocks select miRNA biogenesis;
(3) transcriptional regulation of miRNA expression through activation of transcription factors, including CREB and NF-κB. These
regulatory processes integrate positive and negative regulatory loops in neurotrophin and miRNA signaling pathways, and also expand
the function of neurotrophins and miRNAs. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the regulatory networks between
neurotrophins and miRNAs in brain diseases and cancers, for which novel cutting edge therapeutic, delivery and diagnostic approaches
are emerging.

Introduction

The neurotrophin family of growth factors includes nerve
growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (NT3) and neurotrophin 4 (NT4),
which are important for both physiological and pathological
processes[1–5]. There are two types of neurotrophin receptors:
the low-affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR) and highaffinity tropomyosin-related kinase (TRK) receptors, including TRKA, TRKB and TRKC. All four neurotrophins may
stimulate cells via p75NTR. NGF, BDNF, and NT4, and NT3
also act via TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC respectively. NT3 binds
most strongly to TRKC. However, under some circumstances
it may also act via TRKA and TRKB. Several intracellular signaling pathways are activated by the binding of neurotrophins
to TRK receptors, including the extracellular-signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and
phospholipase C (PLC) pathways[1, 2]. The signaling pathways

activated through p75NTR are more complicated and unclear,
and several reviews discuss these pathways[6, 7]. In addition,
p75NTR has been implicated as a direct regulator of neurogenesis[8, 9], and the increase in adult neurogenesis by NGF and
its mimic may go through p75NTR pathways[10, 11]. Although
these pathways activate many effects of neurotrophins, their
most important function is to regulate specific changes in
gene transcription. Neurotrophins can directly regulate the
expression and activation of transcription factors, including
cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and nuclear
factor kappaB (NF-κB). Although neurotrophin stimulation
can affect the expression of hundreds of genes, the networks
between neurotrophins, transcription factors and their target
genes are not fully understood. To date, most studies have
focused on the neurotrophin-induced expression of proteinencoding genes. However, miRNAs are also transcriptionally
induced by neurotrophins[12, 13].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20–22 nucleotide non-coding
RNA molecules, which regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level and have changed our evolutionary view
of gene regulation[14, 15]. MiRNA genes are usually located in

intergenic or intronic regions as individual or clustered genes.
Several steps must occur before miRNAs can function, including transcription of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs), formation of precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), pre-miRNA transportation out of the nucleus, and miRNA maturation. Many
enzymes, including RNA polymerase II, Drosha, Exportin 5,
Dicer and Argonaute (Ago), are involved in these processes,
and more details can be found in several reviews[14–16]. The
mature miRNAs remain in the Ago complex, and the antisense
miRNAs (miRNAs*) are mostly degraded [12]. MiRNAs target mRNAs by preferentially binding to their 3′ untranslated
regions (3’UTR), promoting their degradation or suppressing their translation into proteins, thereby silencing genes. A
given miRNA can target approximately a hundred mRNAs,
each of which has multiple binding sites, enhancing the overall effects. An mRNA can be targeted by dozens of miRNAs,
thereby responding to different functions. However, approximately 30% of the human protein-coding genome is targeted
by miRNAs[17]. Some mRNA transcripts contain a short 3′
UTR and lack a miRNA binding domain. Many of these ‘short’
mRNAs regulate key cellular functions such as DNA repair
and proliferation[18].
The complex network of miRNAs and the regulation of gene
expression by miRNAs are not fully understood, although
miRNA biogenesis and basic functions have been known for
several years. Knowledge remains scarce about the upstream
regulators of miRNAs that manage their transcriptional and
post-transcriptional control, although thousands of miRNAs

have been discovered. A new era of miRNA regulation is
occurring in neurotrophin studies, although these too have
already been studied for decades. Although this review is
focused on the regulation between neurotrophins and miRNAs in cancer and brain diseases, this regulation is difficult to
clarify due to the triangular, nonlinear relationship between
neurotrophins and miRNAs. Neurotrophins can regulate the
transcription of a subset of miRNAs and transcription factors,
resulting in complex regulatory circuits involving positive and
negative feedback loops (Figure 1). For this review, “neurotrophins” and “miRNAs” were used as keywords to search the
MEDLINE electronic database for English-language articles
reported between January 1994 and May 2014. Relevant articles were then scanned for additional studies.

Regulation of neurotrophins by miRNAs

Brain specific miRNAs were found to play important roles in
neurotrophin expression soon after the recognition of miRNAs
as fundamental regulators of gene expression. Because neurotrophins such as BDNF are key players in many neuronal
functions including survival, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS), miRNAs should
also be involved in most neurotrophin effects. Indeed, the
interaction between BDNF and brain-specific miRNAs is an
area of recent focus. Dicer1 is the key enzyme that processes
pre-miRNA nucleotide duplexes. Many miRNAs were significantly decreased after Dicer1 was deleted in the mouse forebrain, including miR-124, miR-132, miR-137, miR-138, miR-

29a, and miR-29c. Interestingly, the expression of BDNF and
pro-BDNF were higher in Dicer1-deficient mice compared to
controls[19]. This suggested that BDNF expression was suppressed by miRNAs in wild-type animals. Consistent with the
Dicer1 deficiency results, studies of miR-132 and miR-182 support their roles as negative regulators of BDNF in human neuronal cells. Lower BDNF expression correlated with higher
miR-132 and miR-182 expression in the serum of depressive
patients[20]. However, it is unclear how these miRNAs affect
BDNF expression. The mechanism by which miR-134 regulates BDNF may provide a clue. MiR-134 regulates BDNF
expression by post-transcriptionally regulating CREB expression. The transcription factor CREB recruits its co-activators
CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 into a transcriptional
complex, activating CREB-dependent transcription[21]. CREB
also mediates the transcription of BDNF. CREB can bind to
several BDNF promoter elements and enhance its activitydependent regulation[22]. However, there are three partially
complementary binding sites for miR-134 in the 3’UTR of the
mouse CREB gene. One site is well-conserved, and miR-134
can bind directly to it and inhibit the CREB translation. CREB
inhibition will therefore inhibit BDNF gene expression. CREB,
BDNF and miR-134 therefore comprise a regulatory loop
(Figure 1). Consistently, BDNF and CREB are both downregulated when miR-134 is up-regulated in SIRT1Δ mice[23].
NGF, NT3, TrkA, and p75NTR are also regulated by miRNAs in certain conditions. P75NTR is up-regulated in brain
injuries and neurodegenerative diseases and is involved in
apoptosis. The underlying mechanism of p75NTR upregulation is still unclear[10, 24]. Recently, it was reported that p75NTR
expression is regulated by miR-592, and there is an inverse
correlation between miR-592 and p75NTR levels. After cerebral ischemia, miR-592 levels dramatically decreased. In
contrast, the p75NTR level significantly increased. There is
a conserved miR-592 binding site in the 3’UTR of p75NTR.
Importantly, miR-592 over-expression decreased the level of
p75NTR , and in contrast, transduced anti-miR-592 caused a
significant increase in the p75NTR protein level[25]. A miR-21
binding site was identified in the NT3 3’UTR, and there was
an inverse relationship between NT3 and miR-21 in cultured
hippocampal neurons. Further, in the epileptic model, NT3
mRNA levels decreased in the hippocampus following miR21 increase. Notably, miR-21 is a candidate for regulating NT3
signaling in the hippocampus following status epileptics[26].
Likewise, miR-221, a candidate regulator of NGF and TRKA,
is highly conserved in vertebrates. Recently, it was reported
that miR-221 could suppress NGF and TRKA at both the protein and mRNA levels. In respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
infected airways, the expression of NGF and TRKA were
upregulated by silencing miR-221 expression in the infected
cells, and this benefited viral production[27].
MiRNAs regulate neurotrophins and their receptors in an
isoform-specific way. There are two BDNF mRNA isoforms
that translate to the same BDNF protein. Sequence analysis
revealed that there were three miR-206 target sites in the long
BDNF 3’UTR (BDNF-L), but only one in the short BDNF 3’UTR

(BDNF-S). Transfection of pre-miR-206 repressed endogenous
BDNF mRNA levels, and the suppressive effect was related
to the miR-206 targeting sites in the BDNF-L 3’UTR but not
the site in the BDNF-S[28]. Similarly, TRKC has two major
protein isoforms detected in human brain samples: the fulllength, kinase-active receptor (FL-TRKC) and a truncated noncatalytic isoform (T-TRKC). Different functions were found
for T-TRKC, apart from ligand competition with full-length
receptors. FL-TRKC levels were significantly reduced by
miR-151-3p alone. Significant T-TRKC downregulation was
observed with the over-expression of miR-128, miR-485-3p,
miR-765, and miR-768-5p[29]. Importantly, the overexpression
of miR-128 and the inhibition of T-TRKC had the same effects,
including increased cell number. Different miRNA regulation
of different mRNA isoforms therefore mediates different functions in different situations.

Regulation of miRNAs by neurotrophins

BDNF may widely regulate miRNA biosynthesis by enhancing the function of Dicer, the general miRNA processing
enzyme, via the MAPK/ERK pathway[30]. To enhance Dicer
function, BDNF activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway
through the TRKB receptors. Dicer and phospho-TRBP (HIV-1
TAR RNA-binding protein) comprise the miRNA-generating
complex. TRBP phosphorylation and Dicer expression are
mediated by ERK. The phosphorylation of TRBP enhances
miRNA production by increasing the stability of the miRNAgenerating complex with Dicer[31]. BDNF rapidly elevates
Dicer, stabilizes the complex, and increases the levels of
mature miRNAs. Remarkably, approximately 89.4% of detectable endogenous miRNAs were increased more than 2-fold by
BDNF, whereas only 10.6% decreased to <50%[32] (Figure 1). In
addition to the regulatory steps described above, miRNA biogenesis can be regulated at multiple steps by other transacting
factors, including the Lin28 RNA-binding proteins[33]. Moreover, some BDNF-inhibited miRNAs that contain Lin28a binding sites in their terminal loop region were suppressed in their
processing from pre-miRNA to mature miRNA by Lin28a[33]
when Lin28a was elevated by BDNF. This could provide a
mechanism for decreasing the levels of select mature miRNAs
even in the context of Dicer elevation[32]. These findings are
not only consistent with transcriptional specificity in response
to BDNF but also with the increased knowledge of the regulatory processes of BDNF (Figure 1). This transcriptional
regulation affects the functions of BDNF. For example, targets
that are usually upregulated by BDNF, including AMPA glutamate receptor subunit GluA1 (GluA1), calcium calmodulindependent protein kinase II (CaMKIIα), and Homer2, failed to
be upregulated by BDNF in Dicer-deficient neurons. A target
normally downregulated by BDNF, the potassium-chloride
cotransporter (KCC2), was nonresponsive to BDNF in Dicerdeficient neurons[32]. Taken together, at least three ERK related
regulatory pathways function in BDNF regulated miRNA
biogenesis: (1) the ERK dependent enhancement of TRBP and
Dicer upregulates miRNA biogenesis; (2) the ERK dependent
upregulation of Lin28a downregulates select miRNA expresActa Pharmacologica Sinica

sion; (3) the activation of specific transcription factors, such
as CREB, by BDNF. NGF and NT3 also can trigger the PI3K/
AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways through TRKA and
TRKC[1, 2]. The question is whether NGF or NT3 can enhance
miRNA expression by enhancing ERK and Dicer in TRKA or
TRKC positive cells.
Neurotrophins could also regulate the expression of miRNAs by regulating specific transcription factors, including
CREB and NF-κB. The mechanism of miRNA transcription
is the same as that of mRNAs, in which transcription factors
play important roles. Neurotrophins regulate CREB activation through TRK receptors[1, 2], so neurotrophins may regulate
miRNA expression by activating specific transcription factors. Computational searches revealed that several miRNAs,
including miR-124a, miR-9, miR-29a/29b, and miR-132, contain a conserved CRE site in their promoters[34]. The ERK1/2
dependent pathways regulating miR-212/132 discussed above
also have CREB dependent and independent aspects. The
miR-212/132 cluster had absolute fold changes >4 after BDNF
treatment in cultured primary cortical mouse neurons. Some
of the pri-miR-212/132 transcription in response to BDNF was
dependent on the activation of ERK1/2 and Dicer, but others were dependent on the activation of ERK1/2 and CREB[35]
(Figure 1). In the CREB dependent pathway, the phosphorylation of CREB by MSKs downstream of ERK1/2 was involved
in pri-miR-212/132 transcription. CREB binding sites have
been shown previously in the miR-212/132 and miR-9 loci.
Importantly, recent studies demonstrated experimentally that
miR-212/132 and miR-9 are regulated by CREB and involved
in regulating neuronal morphogenesis[36–38]. Similarly, NF-κB
can be regulated by p75NTR signaling[6]. Using selective
NF-κB translocation and DNA binding inhibitors, miR-9, miR125b, and miR-146a up-regulation was shown to be sensitive
to NF-κB[39]. Consistent with this result, the expression of miR146a was proved to be regulated by the p65 subunit of NF-κB
in a Huntington cellular model[40]. Additionally, miR-21 was
regulated by NF-κB and involved in the apoptosis of human
myeloma cells[41].
NGF induction of miRNA expression also depends on the
activation of the ERK1/2 and CREB pathway. For example,
the expression of miR-221 and miR-222 were induced by NGF
stimulation in PC12 cells. This induction was ERK related,
and these miRNAs might contribute to the mechanism of
NGF related cell survival in PC12 cells. In fact, miR-221 and
miR-222 are growth related and derived from the same primiRNA[42]. However, it is unclear whether NGF enhances the
activation of Dicer after sustained ERK activation. Other PC12
studies showed that additional miRNAs were modulated
by NGF, including miR-21, miR-29c, miR-30c, miR-93, miR103, miR-207, miR-691, and miR-709. Among these miRNAs,
significant CRE binding enrichment was identified in the
promoter area, indicating that NGF regulated those miRNAs
through the ERK and CREB pathway[43]. Notably, another
study showed that NGF treatment increased the expression of
miR-181a, miR-221 and miR-326 and decreased the expression
of miR-106b, miR-126, miR-139-3p, miR-143, miR-210, and
Acta Pharmacologica Sinica

miR-532-3p. MiR-221 was dramatically up-regulated[44]. Interestingly, the authors of this paper found a Lin28a binding site
in several miRNAs, including miR-139, mir-143[33] and miR532, after analyzing the terminal loop region of those miRNAs
inhibited by NGF. NGF may downregulate those miRNAs
by the same mechanism as BDNF, enhancing Lin28a through
activated ERK signaling. The neurotrophin regulation of
miRNA synthesis widely expands the functional network of
neurotrophins, as one miRNA can regulate approximately one
hundred mRNAs.

The effects of neurotrophins and miRNAs in brain
diseases

Rett Syndrome and Huntington’s disease (HD) may have a
similar regulatory loop mechanism of miR-132, methyl-CpG
binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and BDNF. MeCP2 gene mutations
cause Rett syndrome, a progressive neurologic developmental disorder. Interestingly, MeCP2 overexpression increased
BDNF transcript levels, which consequently resulted in the
activation of miR-132 through ERK dependent pathways.
Increased miR-132 led to a decrease in the MeCP2 levels[45].
This suggests a negative regulatory loop exists among miR132, BDNF, and MeCP2, shown in Figure 1. To support this
notion, experimentally blocking miR-132 led to increased levels of MeCP2 and BDNF, and loss of MeCP2 decreased BDNF
and miR-132[46]. In some Rett syndrome patients, miR-132
may be abnormally upregulated, causing low levels of MeCP2
and, in turn, leading to disease. In Huntington disease, the
regulatory loop of miR-132, BDNF, and MeCP2 also exists.
MiRNA expression analysis revealed that miR-9/9*, miR29b, and miR-124 were downregulated in HD patient brains,
whereas miR-29a and miR-132 were up-regulated[47, 48]. However, a contradictory report showed decreased miR-132 in HD
animal models, which may be caused by the different disease
stages[48]. Upregulated miR-132 may suppress the expression
of MeCP2 and then suppress the expression of BDNF. Suppressed expression of BDNF in striatal afferents may cause
the neuronal death and behavioral dysfunction of HD. It is
not clear that how the progressive loss of BDNF in cortical or
subcortical afferents contributes to striatal atrophy and behavioral dysfunction in HD patients. However, we can find some
clues from HD animal studies. In R6/2 transgenic mice, a HD
animal model, decreased BDNF expression in the motor cortex
and thalamic afferents started at 6 weeks and progressed until
death at 13–15 weeks, coinciding with striatal neuronal loss
and behavior dysfunction[49]. In addition, BDNF protein levels
were significantly decreased in the striatum of Mecp2-deficient
mice, which was caused by a BDNF trafficking dysfunction[50].
Therefore, miR-132, BDNF, and MeCP2 are all involved in the
regulatory mechanism of Rett Syndrome and HD.
The regulatory loop of miR-132, BDNF, and MeCP2, as well
as other miRNAs and factors, exists in Parkinson disease (PD).
Several miRNAs were reported in epigenetic alterations of PD,
including miR-132, miR-184, and miR-34a. A feedback loop
between epigenetic mechanisms and miR-132, which may act
as mediators of PD, was established via its repressive effect

www.chinaphar.com

on MeCP2 and silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1)[51]. In a
PD animal model, microarray and qPCR results confirmed a
significant increase in miR-132 in affected rats. Nuclear receptor related 1 protein (Nurr1) is one of the known downstream
targets of miR-132, and Nurr1 is essential in the neurogenesis
of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. In PD rats, significant
decreases in Nurr1 and BDNF expression in the mesencephalic neurons were observed, and BDNF is a direct target of
Nurr1[52]. Unlike miR-132, miR-184 is a target of MeCP2. The
expression of miR-184, a brain-specific miRNA, is repressed by
the binding of MeCP2 to its promoter, inducing methylationspecific transcriptional repression. This relationship links
DNA methylation to miR-184 activity, and this regulation
affected synaptic plasticity[53]. The leucine-rich repeat kinase 2
LRRK2 causes familial and sporadic PD. Increasing the level
of miR-184* (antisense miR-184) attenuated the pathogenic
LRRK2 effects in Drosophila[54]. These findings suggest that
miR-184*, MeCP2, and LRRK2 are related to PD. MiR-184*,
but not miR-184, acted on its targets directly, although most
antisense miRNAs are predicted to be degraded after synthesis. Similar to miR-132, miR-34a also inhibited SIRT1, a gene
that regulates cellular senescence, limited cellular longevity
and increased apoptosi[55]. In addition, as a miR-34a target,
CREB plays an important role in PD. CREB is necessary for
the anchoring of CREB-binding protein (CBP), which contains
a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain, and in turn co-activates CREB to exert its beneficial function on neuronal plasticity[51]. The suppression of CREB expression by miR-34a may
also indirectly suppress BDNF expression and increase neuronal apoptosis. Here, miR-132, miR-184*, and miR-34a promote
the epigenetic alterations of PD via DNA methylation, histone
acetylation and the expression of BDNF and other factors.
Neurotrophins and miRNAs regulate cell survival and function in brain injuries and diseases. The p75NTR expression
levels in neurons are partly related to the expression of miR592, and there is an inverse correlation between miR-592 and
p75NTR levels in the adult brain. In cerebral ischemia, an
increase in p75NTR levels correlated with decreased miR-592
levels. Importantly, overexpression of miR-592 in neurons
decreased p75NTR expression levels and attenuated the activation of pro-apoptotic signaling and cell death induced by
ischemic injury. These results suggest that miR-592, a key
regulator of p75NTR expression and a suppressor of neuronal
apoptosis, is a potential therapeutic candidate for ischemic
injury[25]. MiR-132 and MeCP2 were involved in a preconditioning ischemia study. Downregulation of miR-132 in
preconditioning ischemia induced a rapid increase in MeCP2
protein in the mouse cortex. This increased the ischemic tolerance. BDNF expression may be increased by this upregulation
of MeCP2 expression, and this is supposed to be the underlying mechanism of ischemic tolerance. These studies suggest
that miR-132, MeCP2, and BDNF could serve as effectors of
ischemic preconditioning-induced tolerance[56]. In addition,
many overloaded miRNAs were found in Aicardi–Goutiéres
syndrome (AGS) patients, whose symptoms include calcification of the basal ganglia, abnormal cerebral white matter and

diffuse brain atrophy [57]. The genetic pathological mechanisms of AGS show that inherited or sporadic AGS mutations
downregulate RNAse expression, thus inducing overload of
many miRNAs, which in turn activate neurotoxic lymphocytes
and inhibit angiogenesis. Interestingly, AGS caused more
than 16-fold up-regulation of miR-134[57], which targets and
decreases BDNF expression, thereby potentially causing neuronal apoptosis and brain atrophy.
In a neurodegenerative cellular model, withdrawing NGF
causes neuronal differentiation dysfunction and cell apoptosis. Because miR-21 enhanced neurotrophin signaling and
controlled the neuronal differentiation induced by NGF, this
miRNA preserved the neurite network and supported the
viability of the neurons after NGF withdrawal[43]. MiR-21 also
regulates the expression of NT3 in hippocampal neurons of
status epileptic brains. There is a miR-21 binding site in the
3’UTR of NT3. In several epilepsy models, NT3 mRNA levels
decreased consistently with decreased neurite outgrowth and
neuronal cell survival. Recently, it was found that miR-21
expression levels inversely correlated with NT3 mRNA levels
in hippocampal neuronal cultures. To mimic the episode of
status epileptics, treatment with excess KCl, a depolarizing
agent in the neurons, also resulted in an increase in miR-21
and a decrease in NT3 mRNA. MiR-21 may also be a candidate for regulating NT3 signaling in the rat hippocampus
following status epileptics[26]. Moreover, in a degenerative
cellular model of Alzheimer’s disease, primary cultured neurons incubated with the amyloid beta 25–35 (Aβ25–35), pretreatment with neuropeptide Y (NPY) decreased miR-30a-5p
and increased BDNF mRNA and protein levels. Accordingly,
miR-30a-5p targeted the 3’UTR of BDNF and down-regulated
BDNF protein levels in human neuronal cells[58]. Thus, the
miR-30a-5p and BDNF alterations were present in AD-affected
neurons. NPY, by influencing miRNA expression, may affect
BDNF production and exert neuronal protective effects[59].

The effects of neurotrophins and miRNAs in cancers

Neurotrophins and miRNAs are all involved in cancer. Similar to many other growth factors, neurotrophin signaling
is involved in several cancers, and TRK receptor activation
can either enhance or suppress tumor growth. The miRNA
expression levels are altered in many cancers, resulting in
abnormal increases or decreases. As post-transcriptional regulators, miRNAs can either act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. The crosstalk between neurotrophins and miRNAs
will be a very interesting topic in cancer studies for identifying
novel diagnosis and therapeutic methods. For example, the
BDNF/TRKB pathway has a critical role in tumorigenesis,
promoting proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis and
invasiveness in several tumors, including neuroblastoma,
ovarian, breast, prostate and lung cancers. Among these
tumors, the overexpression of BDNF/TRKB might provide an
autocrine survival pathway, and has also been implicated in
poor prognosis in those tumors[60–63]. Interestingly, miR-204
has an equally important role in tumorigenesis, migration and
invasion. In fact, the chromosomal locus containing miR-204

is frequently lost, resulting in its lower expression in ovarian
cancers, breast cancers and pediatric renal tumors. BDNF was
predicted to be a miR-204 target from several prediction algorithms, and this was proved experimentally. Recently, it was
reported that loss of miR-204 resulted in BDNF/TRKB overexpression and activation of the AKT/mTOR/Rac1 signaling
pathway, leading to cancer cell migration and invasion[13].
Thus, miR-204 acts as a potent tumor growth and metastasis
suppressor, inhibiting at least one of the BDNF-TRKB pathways. In addition to BDNF, NT3 can also activate TRKB signaling in some circumstances such as in breast cancers. Similarly, miR-200c is expressed in breast cancers, but is lost in the
more aggressive triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). It is
a potent repressor of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition
that plays an important role in the ability of cells to acquire
the traits necessary to metastasize. MiR-200c may serve as
a potent modulator of subclass-specific gene expression networks in breast cancer, and may be a useful tool for the subclassification of breast cancers. Anoikis is a type of apoptosis
that is triggered by cell detachment from the native extracellular matrix. In suspended anoikis resistant TNBC cells, the
upregulation of both TRKB and NT3 suggests that they are
necessary for survival in suspension. Importantly, miR-200c
can directly target TRKB and NT3 to restore the anoikis sensitivity of TNBC cells[64]. In this study, NT3 was identified as
a TRKB ligand capable of activating TRKB to induce anoikis
resistance. Overexpression of miR-200c decreased both TRKB
and NT3, thereby restoring anoikis sensitivity[64]. These results
indicate that miRNAs, neurotrophins and their receptors comprise a possible therapeutic regimen to treat different types
and stages of tumors, and can also be used as diagnostics for
cancer detection and prediction.
MiRNAs regulate different TRKC isoforms in cancers. The
TRKC gene can be alternatively spliced, yielding different
isoforms. These include FL-TRKC and T-TRKC, which differ functionally and have separate 3’UTRs. This structural
difference supports the hypothesis that these two isoforms
may be differentially regulated by distinct miRNAs. Interestingly, only the truncated TRKC isoform possesses the target
sequences for miR-9, miR-125a, and miR-125b. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-9 and miR-125a/b suppressed
the expression of the truncated TRKC receptor isoform and
decreased the proliferation of SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells[65].
In SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, miR-151-3p alone repressed
FL-TRKC. Four other miRNAs, including miR-128, miR485-3p, miR-765, and miR-768-5p, repressed T-TRKC. In
particular, miR-128 overexpression caused the same morphological changes in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells that were
observed using a siRNA specifically against truncated TRKC,
as well as a significant increase in the cell number[29]. The
isoform-specific regulation of TRKC by miRNAs suggests that
neurotrophins and their receptors can mediate processes that
are strongly linked to miRNA-dependent mechanisms.
MiRNAs may be involved in the ligand-independent function of p75NTR in glioma. Some of the different functions

Acta Pharmacologica Sinica

stimulated by neurotrophins through their receptors appear to
be ligand-independent. For example, several reports suggest
a type of ligand-independent activation of p75NTR signaling. After the ligand binding site of p75NTR, Cys257, was
deleted in the transmembrane domain, ligand-independent
activity still occurred through several pathways that are normally activated by NGF binding to p75NTR[66]. MiRNAs are
candidates to conduct the ligand independent function. Usually, p75NTR acts as a tumor suppressor, causing cellular
apoptosis and suppressing metastatic invasion. However,
p75NTR can also induce invasion and metastasis in glioma
and melanoma. MiR-6165 resides in the 4th intron of p75NTR
in both the human and rat genomes. However, an independent promoter for miR-6165 was not found, and its transcription was thought to occur through its host gene promoter,
the p75NTR promoter. Endogenous miR-6165 is expressed
together with p75NTR in several glioma cell lines and glioma
primary tumors. Similar to the pro-apoptotic role of p75NTR,
overexpression of pre-miR-6165 in U87, a human malignant
glioma cell line, resulted in an elevated rate of apoptosis. MiR6165 functions on its target genes, including neural stem cellderived dendrite regulator (DAGLA) and Polycistin-1 (PKD1),
but not on any p75NTR downstream pathways[67]. Therefore,
the function of miR-6165 is p75NTR related but ligand independent.
The miRNA delivery system is one of the important issues
in the treatment of cancer and brain diseases. Without protection, miRNAs or siRNAs will be degraded in less than 30 min
in the circulatory system. To avoid this, nanomedicine and
nanotechnology methods are being applied to deliver miRNAs. They comprise a novel research field, focusing on formulating biocompatible therapeutic agents such as nanoparticles, nanocapsules, micellar systems, and conjugates[68]. A
nano-carrier system is required to deliver DNA or RNA to
cells, which enhances cell internalization and protects the
nucleic acid from nuclease enzymatic degradation. In addition, nanoparticles may also protect neurons from neurotoxicity due to overloaded nucleic acid[57, 69]. Several nanoparticlebased delivery strategies have been developed in recent years,
including poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles, an FDA-approved commercial material and the most
well-studied degradable synthetic polymer in humans. They
are effective drug delivery vehicles[70] and are particularly
attractive carriers for delivering miRNAs and siRNAs. Most
importantly, nanoparticles composed of PLGA loaded with
a drug have recently been successfully delivered intranasally
into the brain[71], and PLGA loaded with a different drug has
been delivered orally into the circulatory system [72]. PLGA
nanoparticle-delivering siRNAs or miRNAs have been used
widely in cancer[73, 74] as well as Alzheimer’s disease in animal
models[75]. Importantly, other chemicals, nucleic acids and
proteins can be added to the PLGA matrix to extend the features of nanoparticles. The emergence of nanotechnology as
a delivery mechanism trends toward clinical development of
miRNA therapies in cancer and brain diseases.

Conclusion and outlook

While the main focus of previous neurotrophin studies was
on their function, signal transduction and regulation, since
the beginning of the miRNA era, research has focused on
fundamental processes, genomic alterations and target genes.
Recently, studies have identified new regulation of miRNAs and neurotrophins such as miR-6165 and BDNF. They
explored positive and negative loops among miRNAs, neurotrophins and other factors, such as miR-132, MeCP2, and
BDNF, and broadened our understanding of how these neurotrophins and miRNAs are interconnected to regulate many
physical and pathological processes. However, these areas
are very new, and published results obtained from Medline
are so few that conclusions based on these preliminary reports
should always be drawn cautiously.
Nonetheless, promising findings are emerging from the
initial series of studies and the notion that miRNAs and neurotrophins can direct therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.
Notably, an inhibitor of miR-122 (miravirsen) is currently
being tested in a phase 2A clinical trial to assess safety and
tolerability in treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C[76]. Studying the regulatory networks between neurotrophins and miRNAs might serve to find new targets for
neurotrophic drugs[7]. To decrease the toxicity in normal cells,
tumor-targeted nanoparticles have been developed and used
to localize chemotherapeutics to tumors while enhancing efficacy[77]. Likewise, this strategy also can be used for the treatment of brain diseases by miRNAs or siRNAs to decrease the
neurotoxicity from overloaded nucleic acids. For diagnostic
approaches other than testing neurotrophin levels, miRNAs
may provide novel diagnostic methods. Some miRNAs may
be released through exosomes, as miR-16, and these secreted
miRNAs are stable, transferable and functional in the recipient
cells[78], suggesting that specific miRNAs are promising biomarkers for cancer and brain diseases.
