Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNA) regulate fundamental biological processes, including neuronal plasticity, stress response, and survival. Here, we describe a neuroprotective function of miR-132, the miRNA most significantly downregulated in neurons
in Alzheimer’s disease. We demonstrate that miR-132 protects primary mouse and human wild-type neurons and more
vulnerable Tau-mutant neurons against amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) and glutamate excitotoxicity. It lowers the levels of total,
phosphorylated, acetylated, and cleaved forms of Tau implicated in tauopathies, promotes neurite elongation and branching,
and reduces neuronal death. Similarly, miR-132 attenuates PHF-Tau pathology and neurodegeneration, and enhances longterm potentiation in the P301S Tau transgenic mice. The neuroprotective effects are mediated by direct regulation of the Tau
modifiers acetyltransferase EP300, kinase GSK3β, RNA-binding protein Rbfox1, and proteases Calpain 2 and Caspases 3/7.
These data suggest miR-132 as a master regulator of neuronal health and indicate that miR-132 supplementation could be
of therapeutic benefit for the treatment of Tau-associated neurodegenerative disorders.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder typified by profound synaptic loss, brain atrophy, and the presence of extracellular plaques composed
of amyloid β-protein (Aβ), and intracellular neurofibrillary
tangles (NFTs) formed by hyperphosphorylated Tau [3,
27]. NFTs are also pathogenomic for a range of disorders
in which Tau deposits occur in the absence of plaques. The
major primary tauopathies include: frontotemporal dementia
(FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), Pick’s disease,
and corticobasal degeneration. New therapeutic strategies
and targets are desperately needed to treat these devastating
diseases.
miRNAs are small regulatory molecules that post-transcriptionally repress gene expression and thereby regulate
diverse biological processes, including neuronal differentiation, plasticity, survival, and regeneration [42]. miRNAs are
often considered as determinants of cell fate and are also
increasingly acknowledged as prime regulators involved in
various brain pathologies ranging from neurodevelopmental disorders to brain tumors, to neurodegenerative diseases

[26]. Given its immense complexity, the brain expresses the
richest repertoire of miRNA species, with specific miRNAs
being highly enriched in certain cell types of the brain,
e.g., developing or mature cortical neurons. Early studies
reported that deficiency of Dicer, the key ribonuclease in
miRNA biogenesis, resulted in progressive miRNA loss,
death of Purkinje neurons, and cerebellar degeneration [10,
54]. Several neuronal miRNAs have been directly linked to
the regulation of key factors involved in AD, including APP
and Aβ production and clearance [26]. Although multiple
lines of evidence suggest that miRNAs may contribute to the
progression of neurodegenerative diseases, the complexity
of miRNA regulation in targeting many genes and pathways
simultaneously raised concerns about their therapeutic utility as targetable molecules.
One of the most abundant brain-enriched miRNAs is
miR-132, which plays a key role in both neuron morphogenesis and plasticity. miR-132, transcribed by the activitydependent transcription factor CREB, modulates axon and
dendrite development and spine maturation in response to
a variety of signaling pathways [29, 33]. Deletion of the
miR-132 locus decreases dendritic arborization, length,
and spine density, impairs integration of newborn neurons,
and reduces synapse formation in the adult hippocampus
[33, 35, 65]. miR-132 inhibition induces apoptosis in cultured cortical and hippocampal primary neurons via PTEN/
AKT/FOXO3 signaling [67]. Notably, miR-132-deficient
mice exhibit Tau hyperphosphorylation, aggregation, and
decreased memory—all of which are hallmarks of AD [53,
56]. Deletion of miR-132 also fosters Aβ production and
plaque accumulation in a triple transgenic mouse AD model
[22]. Importantly, multiple studies have shown that miR-132
is the most downregulated miRNA in postmortem AD brain
with reductions in miR-132 occurring before neuronal loss
and associated with progression of both amyloid and Tau
pathology [22, 31, 45, 46, 53, 67].
We hypothesized that supplementation of miR-132 activity may protect against AD and other tauopathies. In support of this idea, we report results of a high-content miRNA
screen performed on primary mouse and human neurons
treated with either an AD-specific insult (Aβ) or excitotoxic
levels of glutamate. Among the miRNAs expressed in the
brain, miR-132 exhibits the strongest neuroprotective activity against both Aβ and glutamate. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-132 reduced phosphorylated, acetylated,
and cleaved forms of Tau in primary neurons, as well as
Tau pathology and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in PS19
(TauP301S) mice. Functionally, miR-132 overexpression
enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in WT mice and
rescued the impairment of LTP seen in PS19 mice. These
results suggest that miR-132 replacement could provide neuroprotection and therapeutic value for Tau-associated neurodegenerative disorders, including AD and FTD.

Materials and methods
Primary neuronal cultures and their analysis
Primary cortical and hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from WT (E18) and PS19 (P1; JAX:008169) mice,
and human fetal cortical specimens (provided by Advanced
Bioscience Resources, Alameda, CA, USA). All studies have
been approved and performed in accordance with Harvard
Medical Area and BWH Standing Committee (IACUC)
guidelines. Brain tissues were dissected, dissociated enzymatically by papain, and mechanically by trituration through
Pasteur pipette, plated and cultured as previously described
[64]. Imaging of the cultures was performed using the
IncuCyteTM Live-Cell Imaging System (Essen BioScience). Cell confluency, cell body number, neurite length,
and branching points were monitored and quantified using
the IncuCyteTM software. Neuron viability was measured
using the WST1 assay, following the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche).

Transfections of primary neurons
Transfections of miRNA mimics (Miridian oligonucleotides
at 20 nM final concentration, Dharmacon), inhibitors (LNAcontaining, at 50 nM, Exiqon), siRNAs (at 25 nM, Dharmacon), and the corresponding control oligonucleotides of
the same chemistries to primary mouse and human neurons
were carried out using the NeuroMag technology (OZ Biosciences). The cultures were incubated with the transfection mixture in a standard incubator overnight. Half of the
media was replaced next morning, and the remaining media
were replaced at later time points. Transfection efficacy for
miRNA inhibitors, mimics, and siRNA is 95–100% [67].

SEC isolation of Aβ monomer and preparation
of ½‑tmax Aβ (1–42)
Based on the general consensus that aggregation of Aβ is
required for toxicity, we employed a partially aggregated
preparation of Aβ(1–42) that contained both amyloid fibrils
and Aβ monomer [4, 62]. This preparation is referred to as
1/2tmax, because it is produced by incubating Aβ monomer
for a period that yields half of the maximal level of thioflavin
T. When used at concentration ≥ 10 μM, 1/2tmax can cause
the compromise and death of cultured rodent and human
neurons within a period of a few days [4, 62]. Synthetic
monomer Aβ (1–42) (human sequence) was obtained from
rPeptide (A-1165-2). Briefly, Aβ (1–42) was dissolved at
1 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.5, containing 7 M guanidinium HCl, and 5 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, and

Acta Neuropathologica (2018) 136:537–555

incubated at room temperature overnight. The sample was
then centrifuged at 16,000×g for 30 min and the upper 90%
of supernatant applied to a Superdex 75 10/300 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare Biosciences), eluted at 0.5 ml/
min with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5. Absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Peak fractions were pooled and the concentration of
Aβ determined using ε275 = 1361/M/cm. Thereafter, ½tmax
Aβ(1–42) was prepared as described previously [40]. The
samples were aliquoted, flash frozen on dry ice, and stored
at − 80 °C.

Real‑time quantitative RT‑PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cultures and tissues with
Exiqon RNA isolation kit, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For miRNA quantifications, ­TaqMan® miRNA
assays (Life Technologies) were used, and miRNA levels
were normalized to the geometrical mean of the uniformly
expressed miR-99a, miR-181a, and U6 snRNA. The mRNA
levels were monitored by qRT-PCR with specific primers
listed in the Supplemental Table S1, on the ViiA-7 System
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Threshold cycles (Cts) were
generated automatically, and the relative expressions were
shown as 2 −ΔCt . mRNA levels were normalized to the geometrical mean of 18 rRNA, ACTB, and PABP2 mRNAs.

Western blotting analysis
Proteins have been extracted and the concentrations determined by P
­ ierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit. For Western blot
analysis, the proteins have been resolved on the SDS-PAGE,
transferred to 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad),
blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween
20, and processed for immunodetection. Sarkosyl-insoluble
tau was isolated as previously described [5]. The following
primary antibodies were used following the manufacturer’s
instructions: Tau 5, Tau 46, Tau-PHF, Rbfox1, Calpain 2,
cleaved Caspase-3, cleaved Caspase-7, GSK3β, EP300, and
β-Actin (Cell Signaling). Anti-acetyl-Tau AC312 (rabbit
anti-ac-K174 Tau) and MAB359 (rabbit anti-ac-K274 Tau)
kindly provided by Li Gan’s laboratory were used at 1/5000
dilution. Antibody detection was performed with the HRPcoupled goat secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies
(Immunoresearch), followed by the ECL reaction (Perkin
Elmer) and exposure to Fuji X-ray films. The films were
scanned and signals quantified using the ImageJ software.

Detection of intracellular and extracellular Tau
using ELISAs
Two ELISAs were used in this study. One which is similar to clinically approved assays which employ mid-region

539

directed mAbs and are often erroneously referred to as total
tau assays, and the other a novel C-terminal ELISA that uses
mAbs specific for the C-terminus and MTBR domains of
Tau. The mid-region tau ELISA was performed essentially
as described previously [28]. The anti-tau monoclonal antibody BT2 (Thermo Scientific) at 2.5 μg/ml in TBS was used
for capture and Tau5 conjugated to alkaline phosphatase
was used for detection. Samples were analyzed in duplicate, whereas blanks and Tau441 standards (7.8–8000 pg/
ml) were analyzed in triplicate. Standard curves were fitted
to a five-parameter logistic function with 1/Y2 weighting,
using MasterPlex ReaderFit (MiraiBio). The lower limit of
quantification (LLOQ) was calculated for each plate and for
the results shown the LLoQ was 31 pg/ml. The C-terminal
ELISA was performed exactly as for the mid-region assays
except the polyclonal antibody K9JA (243-441aa) was used
for capture and the mAb TauAB (425-441aa) was used for
detection. For the results shown, the LLoQ of the assay was
7.8 pg/ml.

Cross‑linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP)
iCLIP was performed according to the published protocol
[25], with minor modifications. Briefly, mouse neurons were
irradiated with UV-C light to covalently cross-link proteins
to nucleic acids (400 J/m2). Upon cell lysis, samples were
subjected to DNase treatment and RNA was partially fragmented using low concentrations of the RNase I (0.002 U/
ml, 5 min), followed by the treatment with the RNase inhibitor (RNAsin Plus at 0.5 U/μl) to quench RNase activity.
The Rbfox1–RNA complexes were immunopurified using
the anti-Rbfox1 antibody (Cell Signaling) immobilized on
immunoglobulin G-coated magnetic beads. RNA was isolated and precipitated, and the RT-PCR reactions performed
with the Tau-specific primers to amplify different segments
of the mRNA.

Validation of miR‑132 targets by luciferase reporter
assay
Full-length 3′ UTR sequences of Gsk3β, Calpain2, and
Rbfox1 were cloned into psiCHECK2 plasmid (Promega,
C8021) downstream of renilla luciferase, using XhoI and
NotI. Mutations in the miR-132 binding sites were introduced to these constructs using the QuikChange Multi SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Primers used for
cloning and mutagenesis are indicated in Table S1. Four
hundred nanogram of the constructs were co-transfected
with either miRNA mimics (25 nM final concentration)
or LNA inhibitors (50 nM), in Lipofectamine 2000, to the
SH-SY5Y cells grown in 96-well plates. Alternatively, for
primary neurons, 1 µg of the constructs was used per well
in 24-well plates. Two days after transfections, luciferase

13

540

luminescence was measured using the Dual-Glo Luciferase
Assay System (Promega, E2920) and detected with Infinite
F200 plate reader (TECAN). Renilla luminescence was normalized with that of firefly and the signals were presented as
renilla/firefly relative luminescence.

Lentivirus production and stereotaxic brain
injections
For lentivirus production, the miR-132-expressing PL13pSyn-mmu-miR-132-IRES2-EGFP or control PL13-pSynIRES2-EGFP plasmid was co-transfected with packaging psPAX2 plasmids and VSV-G envelope-expressing
plasmid (Addgene plasmids #12259 and #12260), and the
viruses concentrated by additional ultracentrifugation at
25,000 rpm. Lentivirus titers were determined by PCR and
functional titer was further determined by serial dilutions in
293T cells, using GFP fluorescence. The titer was estimated
using the following formula: titer (TU/ml) = number of
transduced cells in day 1 × percentage of ­GFP+ cells × 1000/
volume of lentivirus used (ml). The lentivirus-expressing
miR-132 (LV-miR132) or empty vector (EV) (2 μl) was stereotactically injected at 6 × 106 TU/ml to the CA1 region of
the right hippocampus (Bregma coordinates: 2.5 mm posterior, 1.7 mm lateral, and 1.8 mm ventral) P–A, 0.5 mm;
C–L, 1.7 mm; D–V, 2.3 mm) of C57BL/6J and PS19 mice.
The animals were randomized to the treatment and control
groups. All animal studies have been approved and performed in accordance with Harvard Medical Area and BWH
Standing Committee for Animal Care (IACUC) guidelines.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Mice were sacrificed by ­CO2 exposure following cervical
dislocation, and the brains fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
embedded, and cryo-sectioned. The 16-μm-thick sections
were immunostained for NeuN, GFAP, Cleaved Caspase-3,
and Tau-PFH with antibodies from Cell Signaling. The sections were first incubated in the blocking solution (7.5%
NGS; 0.4% Triton; 1% BSA; PBS) for 2 h, followed by the
overnight incubation in antibody-containing solution (5%
NGS; 0.2% Triton; 0.5% BSA; PBS), and 2.5-h incubation
with a secondary antibody (either AlexaFluor 568 or AlexaFluor 488; Invitrogen). IHC was visualized by Zeiss confocal microscopy at 20× magnification, and the images were
processed with a computerized image analysis system (ZEN
2012 SP2 Software, Zeiss).

Electrophysiology
Mouse brains were removed and submerged in ice-cold oxygenated cutting solution. Transverse slices (350-μm-thick)
were cut with a vibroslicer from the middle portion of each

13

hippocampus. Slices were incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), transferred to the recording chamber, and
continuously perfused in ACSF saturated with 95% ­O2 and
5% ­CO2. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP)
were recorded in the CA1 region of the right hippocampus. Test responses were recorded for 20–30 min before the
experiment. LTP was induced by two consecutive trains (1 s)
of stimuli at 100 Hz separated by 20 s. The field potentials
were amplified using Axon Instruments 200B amplifier and
digitized with Digidata 1322A. Traces were obtained by
pClamp 9.2 and analyzed using the Clampfit 9.2.

Results
A miRNA screen identifies miR‑132 as strongly
neuroprotective against Aβ and glutamate
excitotoxicity in primary neurons
To identify endogenous miRNAs with neuroprotective properties, we performed a screen on 63 conserved most abundant neuronal miRNAs that together account for more than
90% of all miRNA expressed in the adult mouse brain [2].
Individual miRNAs were inhibited in mouse primary hippocampal and cortical neurons by specific locked nucleic
acid (LNA)-based antisense oligonucleotide inhibitors (antimiRNAs). Alternatively, cells were transfected with nontargeting control oligonucleotides of the same chemistry.
The efficacy of anti-miRNAs was confirmed for selected
miRNAs, using a panel of their previously validated mRNA
targets [7] (Fig. S1a). The neurons were either transfected
at DIV7 and exposed to glutamate (100 μM) 2 days later or
transfected at DIV19 followed by the treatment with toxic
Aβ (1, 5 μM) (Fig. S1b, c, d). Based on the general consensus that aggregation of Aβ is required for toxicity, we
employed a partially aggregated preparation of Aβ (1–42)
that contained both amyloid fibrils and Aβ monomer and is
referred to as ½tmaxAβ [4, 62]. Metabolic activity and cell
viability were assessed by WST1 assays 3 days after glutamate or Aβ exposure, and the effects of miRNA inhibitors
normalized to mock and control oligonucleotide (Fig. 1a).
We observed that inhibition of specific miRNAs protected
against glutamate (e.g., anti-let-7g, i), Aβ toxicity (e.g., antimiRNA-7), or both toxic stimuli (e.g., let-7c, e) (Fig. 1a). In
contrast, inhibition of other miRNAs (e.g., miR-107, miR30a, miR-29, miR-212-3p, and miR-132-3p) exacerbated Aβ
and glutamate toxicities (Fig. 1a), suggesting neuroprotective functions for this group of miRNAs. No correlation was
observed between the expression levels of these miRNAs
[57, 66] and their neuroprotective activities (Fig. S1e).
To validate miRNAs modulating neuronal survival, we
transfected mouse hippocampal neurons with oligonucleotide mimics of the top 12 hits and then added Aβ or

glutamate. As expected, most miRNAs whose inhibitors
decreased the viability in the primary screen appeared neuroprotective when their mimics were applied (miR-132-3p,
miR-212-3p, miR-129-5p, and miR-29a-5p in Fig. 1b). Conversely, the miRNAs whose inhibitors were neuroprotective exacerbated the toxicity (miR-26b and -34a in Fig. 1b).
Similar experiments with both miRNA inhibitors and mimics were also performed on human primary cortical neurons
stressed with Aβ (Fig. 1c). Of note, we could not establish a
reliable and accurate assay for glutamate toxicity in human
primary cells, likely due to the significant protective effect of
glial cells present in these cultures. The results in the rodent
and human cultures were in good agreement for the 12
miRNAs tested, and in both cases, miR-132(-3p) was identified as the most neuroprotective and miR-26b as the most
“neurotoxic” miRNA (Fig. 1b, c). Notably, miR-132 mimic
increased the survival of both human and mouse neurons
treated with Aβ by ~ 20% (Fig. 1a–c). We also observed that
Aβ-induced Tau hyperphosphorylation, which was essential
for Aβ neurotoxicity [49], was restrained by miR-132 overexpression and exacerbated by its inhibition (Fig. 2a, b). At
the same time, exposure to Aβ reduced neuronal miR-132
expression already at 6 h post-treatment (Fig. 2c).

Overexpression of miR‑132 preserves cell body
clusters and neurite integrity in WT and PS19
neurons treated with ½ tmax Aβ
To investigate the protective effects of miR-132 overexpression in vitro and in vivo, we used a PS19 tau transgenic
mouse line which expresses human 1N4R Tau bearing the
P301S mutation associated with FTD [68]. PS19 primary
neurons were transfected with either anti-miR-132, miR132 mimic, or control oligonucleotides, and then treated
with Aβ. As with WT neurons, in PS19 primary neurons,
the miR-132 mimic protected against Aβ, while the antimiR-132 exacerbated sensitivity to Aβ (Fig. 2d). To investigate the effects of miR-132 overexpression on neuronal
morphology in normal versus Aβ-stressed cultures, we
imaged live cells over a 5-day interval (Fig. 2e). Of note,
naïve PS19 cultures appeared less healthy than WT cultures,
exhibited fewer and more clustered cell bodies, and had
shorter and less branched neurites. In both WT and PS19
neurons stressed with ½tmax Aβ, miR-132 mimic increased
the number of healthy cell bodies, neurite length, and branch
points versus neurons transfected with scrambled oligonucleotides (Fig. 2f–h). These data demonstrate that, under
stress or toxic conditions, miR-132 rescues neuritic loss and
helps to maintain neuronal integrity in both WT and mutant
Tau neurons.

miR‑132 reduces the levels of total
and post‑translationally modified forms of Tau, its
cleavage, and release in PS19 neurons
miR-132 downregulation is significantly associated with
human Tau pathology [52], and its genetic deficiency
increases Tau expression, phosphorylation, and aggregation
in 3 × Tg AD transgenic mice [56]. We, therefore, investigated the effects of miR-132 mimic on Tau metabolism,
which, in disease, is dysregulated at multiple levels. Tau
hyperphosphorylation is a hallmark of most tauopathies
[27], but several other post-translational modifications are
also common; for instance, acetylation at Lys174 (K174)
which hinders the interaction between Tau and microtubules
and is thought to foster Tau accumulation and aggregation
[9, 39]. In addition, Tau can undergo proteolytic cleavages
which generate fragments (Fig. 3a) [18, 51], some of which
are prone to aggregation and suggested to be toxic [44, 69].
Western blot analysis revealed that PS19 primary neurons transfected with miR-132 exhibited slightly reduced
levels of total Tau and substantial reduction of Tau phosphorylated at Ser396 and Ser404 (PHF1 epitope) and acetylated at K174 and K274 (Fig. 3b–d). Quantification of
three independent experiments indicated that the reduction
of post-translationally modified Tau isoforms was more
pronounced than that of total Tau (Fig. 3d). These data
indicate that the observed decrease in the levels of phosphorylated and acetylated Tau was not merely a consequence of reduced total Tau. Additional analysis of major
Tau fragments in PS19 neurons using an antibody against
the C-terminal region (Tau46) revealed that miR-132 also
reduced the levels of ~ 36 and ~ 17 kDa Tau fragments
(Fig. 3e, f), the latter being previously characterized as a
potentially neurotoxic fragment(s) produced by Calpain 2
and Caspase 3 proteolytic activities, significant amounts of
which were found in the brains of patients with tauopathies
[13, 14, 50, 51]. Two distinct sandwich ELISA assays, one
based on Tau mid-region detection, reflective of total Tau,
and the other based on the detection of C-terminal fragments (capture and detection antibodies are illustrated in
Fig. 3a), confirmed that miR-132 produces a small (~ 20%)
but a significant reduction of the levels of mid-regioncontaining Tau, and stronger reduction in the levels of
C-terminal-containing Tau (Fig. 3g).
It is now widely appreciated that Tau exists both inside
and outside of neurons [5, 28, 47]. Under normal circumstances, the majority of extracellular Tau is C-terminal
truncated [28, 38, 61], but it has been speculated that,
in disease, the C-terminally truncated forms of Tau are
released and may contribute to the seeding and spreading
of tau aggregates [16]. Since miR-132 diminishes C-terminal Tau fragments inside primary neurons, we next asked

whether it may also affect the release of Tau. Notably,
although the concentrations of extracellular mid-regioncontaining tau were unaffected by miR-132 (Fig. 3h, top),
the levels of extracellular C-terminal-containing secreted
fragments were strongly reduced (Fig. 3h, bottom). Collectively, these results indicate that Tau homeostasis is
regulated by miR-132 at several levels, including the regulation of its post-translational modifications, cleavage, and
release from neurons.

miR‑132 directly targets the Tau modifiers Rbfox1,
GSK3β, EP300, and Calpain 2
To discover among putative miR-132 targets those that
regulate Tau metabolism, we systematically applied several target prediction algorithms. Tau mRNA itself has
been proposed as a direct target of miR-132 [56]; however, the previous work failed to confirm this in human
neural cells [64]. Here, we identified several molecules
that directly link miR-132 to Tau. mRNA for Glycogen
Synthase Kinase-3 β (GSK3β) that contributes to pathologic Tau hyperphosphorylation in AD [15, 58] contains
two conserved putative miR-132-binding sites within
its 3′UTR. Transfections of primary neurons with miR132 mimic reduced GSK3β amounts at both the mRNA
and protein levels (Fig. 4a, b). Furthermore, a luciferase
reporter containing the wild-type GSK3β 3′ UTR was
repressed by the miR-132 mimic and upregulated by the
miR-132 inhibitor. These effects on the reporter were abrogated by a mutation in one of the predicted binding sites
at the position 2644–2650 (Fig. 4c, d). These data provide
evidence that miR-132 directly binds to the GSK3β mRNA
and downregulates its expression, which results in reduced
GSK3β activity and GSK3β-mediated phospho-Tau (Fig.
S3).
Acetyltransferase EP300 is the major acetylase of Tau
at K174 implicated in its aggregation and neurodegeneration in AD [39]. It has been previously reported as one of
the miR-132 targets contributing to its pro-survival/antiapoptotic function [67]. Indeed, miR-132 mimics reduced
expression of EP300, at both mRNA and protein levels in
primary neurons (Fig. 4a, b). These data suggest that the
observed miR-132 effects on Tau acetylation (see Fig. 3b,
d) could be directly mediated by EP300.
Rbfox1, also known as Ataxin-2-binding protein 1, is an
RNA-binding protein (RBP) that plays a pivotal role in alternative splicing, mRNA stability, and translation in the brain
[1, 32]. Rbfox1 was predicted as another highly scored miR132 target; indeed, miR-132 repressed both Rbfox1 mRNA
and protein (Fig. 4a, b). Furthermore, the direct binding
and reciprocal regulation of Rbfox1 by miR-132 mimic and
inhibitor were validated using the luciferase reporters bearing the WT and mutant Rbfox1 3′UTR, as described above

545

for the GSK3β (Fig. 4c, d). We hypothesized that Rbfox1
may regulate Tau mRNA splicing and/or stability. Indeed,
silencing of Rbfox1 by RNAi reduced total mRNA and protein levels of Tau in primary neurons (Fig. 4e, f). Using
iCLIP approach (Fig. S4a), we determined that Rbfox1
directly binds to Tau mRNA (Fig. 4g), preferentially via the
GCAUG motif site found in its coding region (Fig. S4b, c).
Therefore, while the exact molecular mechanism remains to
be established, Rbfox1 appears as a novel RBP that promotes
Tau expression. All together, these data strongly suggest that
miR-132 directly regulates Rbfox1 and thereby reduces Tau
mRNA stability and/or translation.
Finally, we observed that several proteases implicated in
Tau cleavage, including Caspases 3 and 7, and Calpain 2,
are regulated by miR-132 (Fig. 4h). One of them, Calpain
2, has been predicted as miR-132 target (Fig. 4c). qRT-PCR
analysis and luciferase reporter assays confirmed, respectively, that miR-132 reduced Calpain 2 mRNA expression
(Fig. 4a), and this effect was mediated by the direct miR-132
binding to the Calpain 2 3′UTR (Fig. 4d). Therefore, miR132 regulates Calpain 2 expression and may, thereby, regulate Tau cleavage. Additional rescue experiments on neurons
co-transfected with anti-miR-132 and siRNAs cognate to
either Rbfox1, GSK3β, EP300, or Calpain 2 demonstrated
that these targets, indeed, mediated miR-132 control of tau
levels, modifications, and cleavage, respectively (Fig. 4i,
j). Overall, these data indicate that miR-132 regulates Tau
modifiers, including GSK3β, EP300, Rbfox1, and Calpain 2
that collectively contribute to Tau homeostasis in neurons. In
addition, Caspases 3/7-mediated cleavage of Tau may also
be regulated by miR-132 via PTEN/AKT/FOXO3A signaling [67].
To further investigate whether any of the direct miR-132
targets play a dominant role in neuroprotection against Aβ,
we compared the effects of miR-132 mimic to that of individual siRNAs cognate to their targets (GSK3β, EP300, Calpain 2, Rbfox1, and previously validated Foxo3a). To mimic
target repression provided by miR-132, siRNA concentrations and transfection conditions were optimized to ensure
100% transfection efficiency in P301S neurons with similar level of downregulation for target mRNAs and proteins
(Fig. 5a–c). Downregulation of EP300 and GSK3β resulted
in a slightly but significantly improved viability of neurons
treated with ½tmax Aβ, while the individual downregulation
of Calpain 2, Rbfox1, and Foxo3a was insufficient to reduce
the Aβ toxicity. Transfections of the five siRNAs together
enhanced the neuroprotection relative to the effects of individual siRNAs, but still did not reach the level of protection
provided by miR-132 (Fig. 5c). These results indicate that
the neuroprotective properties of miR-132 are mediated by
multiple target genes, rather than a single key target, and,
perhaps, additional genes beyond the five studied here.

miR-132 overexpression in CA1 and ~ 1.5-to-2-fold in CA2/
CA3 neurons for at least 1 month were selected for the subsequent experiments (Fig. 6c). This increase in miR-132, but
not its paralog miR-212, led to a corresponding downregulation of validated miR-132 targets, at mRNA and protein
level, including pro-apoptotic FOXO3a, EP300, and downstream effector Bim, and newly established targets Rbfox1,
GSK3β, and Calpain 2 (Fig. 6d–f). Therefore, this lentivirus
system provides sustained functional miR-132 overexpression in mouse hippocampus.
We then investigated the neuroprotective effects of LentimiR132 in PS19 mice, which develop NFT-like inclusions
in the brain and spinal cord starting at around 6 months of
age and evince neuronal loss and brain atrophy by 8 months
[36]. In the first set of experiments, the viruses were stereotactically injected into the CA1 hippocampal area twice, first
at 7.5 months, and then at 9 months of age. Three experimental groups that included untreated animals, and mice
injected to the right hippocampus with either Lenti-empty
or Lenti-miR132, were analyzed in parallel (15 mice per
group). The animals were sacrificed at 10.5 months, and
the brains analyzed by IHC and quantitative image analysis
for key markers, including the PHF-Tau, NeuN, activated
Caspase-3, and GFAP, and further by Western blotting
(Fig. 7a–g). There were ~ 19% fewer NeuN-positive neurons in the hippocampal CA1 areas and adjacent cortical
layers of PS19 mice than in the WT brains (Fig. 7a, c). PHFTau (a marker of pathology) as well as cleaved caspase-3 (a
marker of apoptosis) were evident in all PS19 brain sections,
but absent in WT brains (Fig. 7a, d, e and Fig. S6). LentimiR132 significantly reduced the numbers of cells positive
for PHF-Tau and cleaved caspase-3 in comparison to the
contralateral hemispheres, and to the brains injected with
the empty virus, or left untreated (Fig. 7a, d, e, g). The levels
of sarkosyl-insoluble PHF-Tau, cleaved, and acetylated Tau
were also reduced by miR-132 (Fig. 7h, i). Correspondingly,
image quantification indicated that Lenti-miR132 increased
the number of NeuN-positive hippocampal neurons in PS19
mice (Fig. 7c), but GFAP staining was not different between
the PS19 groups (Fig. 7a, f, g). Consistent with the reduced
Tau pathology and neuronal apoptosis, miR-132 increased
hippocampal volume relative to the Lenti-Empty group
(Fig. S7). These results demonstrate a significant in vivo
neuroprotection provided by miR-132 in PS19 mice in the
progressive stage of neurodegeneration.
In an additional set of experiments, PS19 mice were stereotactically injected with Lenti-miR132 a total of three times
(i.e., at 3, 4.5, and 6 months, 7 mice per group) before onset
of pathology, and analyzed at a time point when pathology is obvious in untreated PS19 mice (i.e., 10 months). In
accord with our “treatment” study, overexpression of miR132 prevented neuronal loss and accumulation of PHF-Tau
when administered prior to the emergence of tau pathology

549

(Fig. S8). Thus, dependent on the time of administration,
neuronal miR-132 can prevent or halt Tau pathology and
neurodegeneration.

Overexpression of miR‑132 enhances hippocampal
LTP in WT mice and restores it in PS19 mice
To further investigate functional effects of miR-132 supplementation in the brains of PS19 mice, we measured
hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), an electrophysiology correlate of learning and memory. Standard
high-frequency stimulation (HFS) was applied to the CA1
hippocampal region of WT and PS19 mice, and average percent changes in fEPSP slopes relative to baseline stimulation were plotted over time post-HFS (n = 7–15) (Fig. 8a,
b). As expected for mice exhibiting neuronal loss [68] LTP
was consistently lower in brain slices from 7.5-month PS19
mice than in age-matched WT mice (136 ± 4%, n = 15 vs.
165 ± 8%, n = 12, P < 0.001; Fig. 8a). In WT mice, LTP
was enhanced in animals injected with LV-miR132 more
than in those injected with empty LV (212 ± 10%, n = 7
vs. 161 ± 7%, n = 7, P < 0.001; Fig. 8b). In PS19 mice,
LV-miR132 treatment dramatically increased LTP to levels greater or comparable to that of untreated WT mice
(181 ± 8%, n = 7 vs. 135 ± 5%, n = 6, P < 0.001; Fig. 8c–e).
LV-miR132 treatment also potentiated the effects of weak
HFS that was insufficient to induce significant LTP in hippocampal slices (115 ± 3 vs. 138 ± 4%, P < 0.001; Fig. 8f).

Discussion
Several lines of evidence implicate reduced miR-132
activity in AD and related neurodegenerative conditions.
First, from many independent attempts to define miRNAs
linked to AD pathology, miR-132 has emerged as the top
molecule significantly associated with both plaques and
tangles in a variety of disease affected brain areas [21, 22,
24, 45, 53, 64, 67]. miR-132 is downregulated starting at
Braak III stage, before neuron loss, and miR-132 reduction is evident in phospho-tau-positive neurons [31, 53].
Furthermore, miR-132 downregulation has been described
in other neurodegenerative disorders linked to aggregation and accumulation of misfolded protein Tau, including
frontotemporal lobar degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy [6, 21, 55]. Although miR-132 downregulation in the latter classes of tauopathies still requires validation in larger brain cohorts, the data suggest a possible
common mechanism underlying miR-132 dysregulation
in both AD and primary tauopathies. Second, miR-132
knockout impairs memory formation and retention in adult
mice, induces Tau aggregation, and aggravates both tau
and amyloid pathologies in transgenic mouse models [22,

31, 53]. Third, our high-content screen for miRNA modulators of neuroprotection against Aβ and glutamate excitotoxicity performed in this study, identified miR-132 as the
top hit (Fig. 1). Finally, miR-132 has important regulatory
functions in neuron development, synaptic plasticity, and
survival. Of note, additional neuroprotective (e.g., miR-29
and miR-129) and “neurotoxic” (e.g., miR-26b and miR34a) miRNAs identified in our screen have been previously
implicated in the regulation of critical genes and pathways
in AD [20, 41, 45]; it will be important to investigate these
hits in future studies.

Several targets and signaling pathways may underlie
miR-132 neuroprotective functions. Some of them, such as
p250GAP, RASA1, and MeCP2, mediate the role of miR132 in neurite extension, arborization, and synaptogenesis
[63]. Other targets, such as PTEN, p300, and FOXO3a,
counteract AKT pro-survival signaling; their derepression
observed in AD neurons and probably caused by miR-132
downregulation may induce expression of the key apoptotic
effectors Bim and Puma, leading to activation of caspases
and apoptotic signaling [67], and also promoting Tau cleavage. Furthermore, recent reports suggest certain direct

13

552

miR-132 targets implicated in Aβ and Tau metabolism,
including the Tau mRNA itself [56]. However, miR-132
does not appear to regulate Tau in human neurons directly
[64]. Tau homeostasis is tightly controlled at multiple levels,
and we report here that miR-132 regulates key factors affecting tau production, post-translational modifications, and
proteolysis. Specifically, miR-132 regulates tau phosphorylation (via direct targeting of GSK3β), acetylation (via a
EP300), and cleavage (through calpain 2 and caspases-3/7),
and it also reduces Tau mRNA via the direct targeting of
the RNA-binding protein, Rbfox1. Tau hyperphosphorylation at PHF1 epitope, largely mediated by GSK3β, affects
microtubule dynamics and NFT accumulation, which is considered a hallmark cytopathology in AD and other tauopathies [23]. Since we validated both major tau kinase GSK3β
and acetylase EP300 as the direct miR-132 targets (Fig. 4,
and [67]), and additional tau kinase CDK5 is also indirectly
repressed by miR-132 via NOS1 signaling [64], thus, miR132 emerges as the major regulator of the post-translational
modifications of Tau.
Our work also demonstrates that miR-132 regulates Tau
cleavage and implicates a newly validated target calpain 2,
as well as caspases 3 and 7, in this event. Tau is cleaved by
multiple proteolytic enzymes which facilitate its degradation
and clearance. However, if allowed to accumulate, some of
these fragments become aggregated and/or hyperphosphorylated and neurotoxic [18, 51]. For instance, Tau cleavage by calpain 2 produces a 17 kDa neurotoxic fragment,
and significant amounts of these fragments are found in the
brains of patients with tauopathy [14, 50]. Mutations in calpain in transgenic flies were shown to prevent Tau toxicity [50]. In addition to the proteolysis of Tau, Calpain also
cleaves p35, the principal activator of Cdk5, into p25, which
results in the hyperactivation of both Cdk5 and GSK3β, and
thereby induces tau hyperphosphorylation [8, 30]. Here,
we demonstrate that miR-132 not only regulates Calpain 2
directly, but its levels also inversely correlate with the levels
of Calpain 2 mRNA in hundreds of AD brains, suggesting
that miR-132 is a primary regulator of Calpain 2 expression
in the brain, responsible for its upregulation in AD. In addition, caspase 3/7 activity, modulated by miR-132 indirectly,
likely through PTEN/FOXO3/Bim signaling [67], may also
contribute to Tau cleavage and the observed release of tau
fragments from neurons (Fig. 3d, e).
We also validated Rbfox1, an RNA-binding protein
highly expressed in neuronal tissues, as another direct miR132 target. By binding to the GCAUG element, Rbfox1 plays
a pivotal role in alternative splicing, mRNA stability, and
translation [1, 32]. The Rbfox1 knockout mice have a significant increase in neuronal excitability in the dentate gyrus
[19], and a recent study identified a link between Rbfox1
protein and AD [1]. We demonstrate that Rbfox1 binds to
and stabilizes neuronal Tau mRNA. Altogether, considering

13

Acta Neuropathologica (2018) 136:537–555

the additional miR-132 target PTBP2 previously implicated
in Tau mRNA splicing [55], these data position miR-132 as
the principal regulator of various aspects of Tau homeostasis
provide a mechanistic link between the miR-132 downregulation and Tau pathology observed in disease.
Overall, our work supports miR-132 as the master regulator of neuronal health. In addition to its distinct functions in
synaptogenesis, neuronal activity, plasticity, memory, and
neuronal viability [37, 63], miR-132 regulates Tau metabolism, and its downregulation in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases likely promotes pathogenesis by perturbing
multiple signaling pathways. Interestingly, an initial increase
in miR-132 levels during early AD Braak stages I–II in the
human prefrontal cortex has been described, which contrasts
with the decrease seen at more advanced stages of the disease [31]. A similar bi-phasic miR-132 expression pattern
has been reported in prion disease [34], suggesting that miR132 is part of an initial neuroprotective response. Subsequent
downregulation, however, can aggravate the effects of Aβ
and Tau toxicities [22]. Of note, miR-132 is regulated by
the activity-dependent cAMP-response element-binding
(CREB) transcription factor, and its expression pattern in
the AD brain mimics that of the brain-derived neurotrophic
factor [29]. In addition, alterations in DNA methylation that
affect gene expression and perhaps the onset of AD [11]
may play a role in miR-132 downregulation in neurons, as
demonstrated for some cancer cells [17].
Collectively, these data suggest that miR-132 replacement
in tauopathies, such as AD, may provide a much-desired
neuroprotective effect. Lowering Tau alone with antisense
oligonucleotides (ASO) has recently been shown as therapeutically beneficial for tauopathies [12]. Here, we provide a
proof-of-principle for miR-132 replacement as a novel neuroprotective strategy to reduce Tau pathology and simultaneously promote nerve growth and regeneration, enhance
neuronal survival, and, consequently, improve cognition.
miR-132 supplementation protects against strong toxic
stimuli even in highly vulnerable and damaged Tau-mutant
neurons, in vitro and in vivo. It had preventive effects in
young presymptomatic PS19 mice and reduced neuronal loss
and Tau pathology even when pathology was already established. The PS19 model exhibits broad brain and spinal cord
pathology resulting in severe cognitive, motor, and visual
impairments [59, 68]. Since our proof-of-concept study
relies on the lentivirus-mediated local unilateral miR-132
supplementation to the CA1 region, it did not allow examination of the effects on global readouts such as neurologic
and behavioral phenotypes. To overcome this limitation,
broader distribution of miR-132 mimics in the CNS will
be required.
Notably, small molecules and other types of inhibitors
of major miR-132 targets have entered clinical trials. These
include inhibitors of GSK3β, EP300, Calpains, as well

Acta Neuropathologica (2018) 136:537–555

as Tau-targeting antibodies and ASO drugs [24, 48, 60,
70]. Remarkably, miR-132 is the natural inhibitor of each
of these factors. Therefore, its replacement can provide a
multi-hit approach and ensure the benefits of combination
therapies. MiR-132 replacement strategies for tauopathies
will largely rely on the development of miRNA-mimicking
oligonucleotides and technologies for their delivery to the
brain and leverage recent advances in the field of oligotherapeutics. Notably, the first “breakthrough” oligonucleotidebased drug for a neurologic disease has recently gained fast
FDA approval [43], and many more are at different stages
of clinical development for a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders. AD and other tauopathies have so far
proven refractory to small molecules and biological drugs,
and miRNA mimics emerge as a new and promising class
of therapeutics. Our work validates miR-132 as a first-line
candidate for development of such neurotherapies.
