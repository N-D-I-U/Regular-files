Biology of Parkinson’s disease:
pathogenesis and pathophysiology of a
multisystem neurodegenerative disorder
Garrett E. Alexander, MD, PhD

P

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common
movement disorder. The characteristic motor impairments—bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor—result
from degenerative loss of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra, and are responsive to symptomatic treatment with dopaminergic medications and
functional neurosurgery. PD is also the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Viewed from this perspective, PD is a disorder of multiple functional systems,
not simply the motor system, and of multiple neurotransmitter systems, not merely that of DA. The characteristic
pathology—intraneuronal Lewy body inclusions and
reduced numbers of surviving neurons—is similar in each
of the targeted neuron groups, suggesting a common
neurodegenerative process. Pathological and experimental studies indicate that oxidative stress, proteolytic stress,
and inflammation figure prominently in the pathogenesis of PD. Yet, whether any of these mechanisms plays a
causal role in human PD is unknown, because to date we
have no proven neuroprotective therapies that slow or
reverse disease progression in patients with PD. We are
beginning to understand the pathophysiology of motor
dysfunction in PD, but its etiopathogenesis as a neurodegenerative disorder remains poorly understood.

arkinson’s disease (PD), which afflicts nearly 1%
of the population above the age of 60, is a multisystem
neurodegenerative disorder in which progressive loss of
midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, with resulting
dopaminergic deafferentation of the basal ganglia, gives
rise to characteristic motor disturbances that include
slowing of movement, muscular rigidity, and resting
tremor. These signs of motor dysfunction, if lateralized,
can be clinically diagnostic of PD.1 They are, however,
only a subset of the assorted motor, cognitive, affective,
autonomic, and even sensory impairments that result
from selective degeneration of different neuron types at
multiple levels of the central and peripheral nervous systems. A definitive diagnosis of PD requires pathological
confirmation of two invariant features: distinctive intraneuronal inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LBs) in
regions of predilection, and reduced numbers of DA
neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc).
PD is, for the most part, a sporadic disorder. Loose familial clustering, in which the pattern of inheritance is not
apparent, occurs in up to 15% of cases. Forms of familial PD in which inheritance follows a mendelian pattern
are exceedingly rare, accounting for less than 1% of all
PD patients. Among all PD patients, the average age at
symptom onset is 60. Except for the rare forms of familial PD with mendelian inheritance, the disease is rare in
those under 40 years of age. Thereafter, the prevalence
rises rapidly, so that by the end of the seventh decade an

parkinsonism resembling that seen in sporadic PD.10 This
human model of MPTP-induced parkinsonism was characterized by profound losses of brain-stem monoaminergic neurons and corresponding depletion of striatal DA,
mirroring many of the clinical and pathological features of
sporadic PD.10 The principal exception was the paucity of
LB pathology in the MPTP model of PD. Further study
revealed that the active metabolite of MPTP was MPP+
(1-methyl-4-phenylpyridium ion),11 a potent mitochondrial toxin that is readily concentrated within SNc neurons
due to its affinity for the dopamine transporter (DAT).12,13
By inhibiting mitochondrial complex I of the respiratory
chain, MPP+ markedly enhances oxidative stress in SNc
neurons.14

estimated 1 person in 200 has the disease, and by the end
of the eighth decade the proportion is 1 in 40.2 At this
point, the annual rate of newly diagnosed cases has risen
to about 1 for every 1000 persons of comparable age.3 In
spite of tremendous improvements in the quality of life
of PD patients since the introduction of levodopa, mortality rates continue to be increased in those with the disease, ranging from 1.5 to 2.3 times higher than rates for
those without PD.4-6 In most series, the frequency of PD
is the same for both sexes.2
For nearly 150 years after the first clinical description of
the disease in 1817—An Essay on the Shaking Palsy by
James Parkinson—little was known about the biology of
PD. The landmark observation in 1960 that striatal DA
levels were sharply reduced in PD patients led directly to
a series of remarkable advances that greatly enriched our
understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder.7
Already known to be a precursor of DA and suitable for
oral administration, levodopa was promptly tested and
found effective in treating the symptoms of PD. Chronic
oral administration of levodopa became a mainstay of
PD pharmacotherapy and remains so today8—notwithstanding the current availability of effective direct-acting
DA agonists, and mounting concerns about levodopa’s
possible long-term toxic effects on DA neurons.9
A second breakthrough in PD research came in the early
1980s, with the serendipitous and insightful discovery of a
toxin-induced model of PD in humans. MPTP (1-methyl4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) was the unintended
byproduct of an illicitly manufactured opiate whose
users rapidly developed progressive, levodopa-responsive

Although PD is known primarily as a movement disorder originating in the basal ganglia, the neurodegenerative process targets select neuron groups distributed
throughout the neuraxis, including specific parts of cortex, thalamus, brain stem, and spinal cord, as well as sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia (Table I). Among
the neurotransmitters and neuromodulators represented
in these extranigral neuron losses are acetylcholine
(ACh), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), noradrenaline (NA), and glutamate. Despite the obvious
complexities, the neuropathology appears the same in
each of the regions affected, suggesting a common underlying pathogenic process.
Midbrain DA neurons
The defining motor deficits in PD are linked to the selective vulnerability of a particular subgroup of nigral DA
neurons.15,16 Cell loss is most profound in the lateral half
of the ventral tier of neurons in the SNc, corresponding
to the subset of nigrostriatal neurons that give rise to
most of the dopaminergic innervation of the lateral neostriatum, which includes the sensorimotor region of the
putamen.17 Preferential loss of these neurons accounts for
the characteristic topography of DA depletion in PD,
with the steepest reductions in striatal DA levels being
measured in the target zones of their projections.18
Progression of motor dysfunction in PD is correlated
with reductions in various markers of nigrostriatal DA
terminals within the same striatal territories.19-21

Involvement of midbrain DA neurons in PD is remarkably
selective. While neuron loss is severe within ventrolateral
SNc, the remainder of the nucleus is relatively spared.22,23
Moreover, the nearby A8 group of DA neurons (SNc corresponds to the group designated A9 in early histochemical studies) is spared entirely, as are all but two of the
seven nuclei constituting the A10 group.24 The A10 group
constitutes the principal source of dopaminergic projections to frontal and limbic cortex (the so-called “mesocortical” pathway).25 Restricted cell loss in A10 may explain
the notably circumscribed character of the cortical DA
reductions observed in PD.24 Depletion of mesocortical
DA is limited to cortical layer I in PD, while the remaining and far more substantial dopaminergic input to deeper
layers of cortex is well preserved.26
Retinal DA neurons
Certain visual impairments occur commonly in PD, in
conjunction with loss of DA-producing retinal amacrine
cells in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers and sec-

ondary depletion of the dopaminergic fiber plexus of the
inner plexiform layer.27 Resulting loss of dopaminergic
modulation of the early stages of visual processing28 is
associated with impaired color perception and reduced
spatial and temporal contrast sensitivity,29,30 as well as
electroretinographic abnormalities and altered patternevoked potentials.31,32 These visual disturbances are correlated with disease severity33 and can be partially
reversed with levodopa therapy.34,35
Olfactory DA neurons
Olfactory dysfunction occurs early and often in PD, in
association with early neuron loss and LB formation in
the anterior olfactory nucleus and extensive LB pathology in the olfactory bulb.36,37 Hyposmia is demonstrable
in up to 90% of PD patients in whom olfaction is formally tested,38 but this deficit is unrelated to disease duration or severity and is typically asymptomatic.39 In contrast to the characteristic depletion of DA neurons in
SNc, the population of DA neurons in the olfactory bulb

actually increases in PD (in fact it more than doubles),
mainly within the glomerular layer.40 While this increase
may appear paradoxical, its association with hyposmia is
consistent with—and may be explained by40—separate
evidence that olfactory transmission within the glomerular level is inhibited by DA41 due to a local predominance
of d2 receptor types.42
A similar increase in the population of intrinsic DA neurons of the striatum occurs in the MPTP model of PD.43
The normally small population of these tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)–positive interneurons44 increased more than
threefold in the putamen of monkeys rendered parkinsonian by destruction of the nigrostriatal DA neurons.43
Pontine noradrenergic neurons
By the time of SNc involvement in PD, extranigral pathology has generally extended to other vulnerable cell groups
within the brain stem.45 Notable among these are the noradrenergic neurons of the locus ceruleus (LC)46,47 and the
serotonergic nuclei of the median raphe (nMR).37,48 The
wide-ranging and profuse axonal projections of LC neurons provide noradrenergic innervation to virtually the
entire central nervous system (CNS)—except for the basal
ganglia.49 Apart from a restricted portion of the ventral
striatum (the shell region of the nucleus accumbens),
neither the striatum nor the globus pallidus receives significant input from LC49; noradrenergic innervation of the
subthalamic nucleus appears to be minimal in primates.50
Loss of LC neurons in PD results in marked reductions in
NA levels in cerebellum51 and frontal cortex.26 It is not
known whether this accounts for the reported association
between the severity of neuron loss in LC and clinical
signs of akinesia and rigidity in PD.15
Pontine serotonergic neurons
Loss of 5-HT–producing nMR neurons leads to corresponding serotonergic denervation throughout the neuraxis, including cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, brain stem,
and spinal cord.48 Severity of neuron loss in nMR has been
linked to the occurrence of clinical depression in PD.15
Depletion of these neurons may also contribute, along
with characteristic losses of LC and SNc neurons, to the
remarkably strong association between PD and REM
(rapid eye movement) sleep behavior disorder (RBD).52-54
In some PD patients, development of RBD symptomatology may precede the onset parkinsonism by several years.55

Pontine cholinergic neurons
Selective loss of cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is another characteristic of PD
pathology.56,57 PPN contains two populations of neurons,
cholinergic neurons in pars compacta (PPNc) and glutamatergic neurons in pars dissipatus (PPNd).58,59 PPNd
neurons send glutamatergic projections to globus pallidus
pars interna (GPi)/substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr),
SNc, and subthalamic nucleus (STN). The cholinergic
neurons project to thalamus and to GPi/SNr. PPN is
somatotopically organized in primates, receiving corticotegmental inputs from motor cortex and from multiple
nonprimary cortical motor fields that converge in topographic fashion to represent each body part.60 Despite
this somatotopical segregation, there is compelling
anatomical evidence that functionally segregated GPi
outflow from motor, associative, and limbic territories
overlaps within PPN to provide functionally integrated
input to the target neurons, which are limited to the noncholinergic projection neurons of PPN.61
The cholinergic neurons of PPN and laterodorsal
tegmental nuclei promote REM sleep with muscular atonia through excitatory modulation of the REM sleep
induction region within the medial pontine reticular formation.62 Both PPN and the laterodorsal tegmental
nuclei receive converging monoaminergic inputs from
nMR (5-HT), LC (NA), and SNc (DA) neurons, and all
of these neuromodulatory inputs are effectively
inhibitory due to the particular types of slow postsynaptic receptor they engage (5-HT1A, β, and d2 receptor
types, respectively).62 Loss of these combined sources of
inhibitory modulation of REM sleep induction might
explain the increased frequency of RBD in patients with
PD if RBD resulted simply from overactivity of the
REM sleep induction center. However, RBD involves
not only the inappropriate induction of REM sleep activity, but the loss of REM-associated muscular atonia as
well.63 Recent experimental studies suggest that basal
ganglia sources of GABAergic (GABA, γ-aminobutyric
acid) input to PPN may also be important to the normal
control of REM sleep with atonia.
PPN also receives substantial GABAergic projections
from the basal ganglia output nuclei, GPi and SNr, which
are tonically overactive and show variable amounts of
abnormal oscillatory activity in PD and experimental
parkinsonism (see below). Electrical microstimulation of
SNr has been shown recently to disrupt REM sleep with

262

atonia induced by activation of PPN.64 Moreover, activation of different foci within SNr produced variable dissociation of REM sleep and muscular atonia components. Intermingled throughout lateral SNr were
microstimulation sites that attenuated REM sleep but
not atonia, atonia but not REM sleep, or both components.64 In PD, degenerative loss of some PPN neurons
combined with excessive and oscillatory GABAA-mediated inhibition of the others via the SNr afferents seems
a plausible mechanism that may account for the frequent
occurrence of RBD is this disease.
Studies of experimental parkinsonism have also implicated in PPN in the pathophysiology of akinesia. Fibersparing lesions, pharmacological inactivation, and highfrequency stimulation of PPN in normal monkeys result
in akinesia.65-67 The akinesia in PD might result from
excessive GABAergic inhibitory outflow from GPi/SNr
to PPN. This is suggested by the observation that akinesia in MPTP-induced parkinsonism can be reversed by
microinjection of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline into
PPN.68
Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons
Loss of cholinergic neurons of the basal nucleus of
Meynert (nBM) is common in PD, and can be associated
with dementia.49,69,70 Of course, depletion of nBM neurons
is also seen—characteristically so—in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is by far the most common neurodegenerative disorder. The prevalence of AD exceeds that
of PD by more than an order of magnitude.71 Reports
linking dementia with ostensibly PD-induced cell loss in
nBM have been appropriately careful to include only
those cases in which the neurodegenerative changes in
nBM were characteristic of PD rather than AD, ie, where
LBs were demonstrable in surviving neurons and signs
of AD—senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles—were
minimal or absent.72
Amygdala: basolateral and cortical nuclei
Pathological involvement of the basolateral nucleus of
the amygdala is also frequent in PD, although cell loss
here is typically minimal despite extensive LB pathology.73,74 The glutamatergic neurons of this nucleus have
linkages with both ventromedial prefrontal cortex and
ventral striatum, and are believed to play significant roles
in memory and learning.75,76 In PD patients with visual

hallucinations, the proportion of basolateral neurons containing LBs was reported to be roughly twice that of
patients who were free of hallucinations.73
An additional factor that may contribute to hyposmia in
PD is the neuron loss and associated LB pathology that
typically affects the cortical nucleus of the amygdala.73,74
The nucleus has powerful reciprocal connections with
olfactory structures.
Cortical, thalamic, and hypothalamic neurons
Neuron loss and LB pathology is also seen commonly in
select regions of cerebral cortex, thalamus, and hypothalamus in PD brains, including presupplementary
motor area,77 insular and anterior temporal cortex, centromedian and parafascicular thalamic nuclei,78 and
supraoptic and paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei.79,80
Yet, as we have seen, while neuron loss and LB formation are widespread in PD, they are also highly select in
targeting only particular cell groups and generally sparing all but a few circumscribed regions of cortex.74,81 This
serves to distinguish idiopathic PD from Lewy body
dementia (LBD), a much rarer condition in which the
neurodegenerative changes are qualitatively indistinguishable from those of PD yet differ sharply in quantitative terms.82-84 In LBD, unlike PD, there is diffuse and
severe cortical involvement, which appears to explain the
prominent cognitive decline that appears early in LBD,
but is seldom a feature of PD.
Autonomic nervous system
Autonomic disturbances in PD are frequent and varied,
due to cell loss and LB pathology involving both preganglionic and postganglionic components of both the
sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems.85-87
The earliest pathological changes in PD are in fact extranigral, beginning with formation of LBs and loss of cholinergic neurons within the dorsal glossopharyngeus-vagus
complex.37,45 Progressive loss of these preganglionic
parasympathetic neurons is one of the factors contributing to the dysphagia and esophageal dysmotility that occur
frequently in PD patients.88,89 Postganglionic parasympathetic cell loss and LB pathology within upper portions of
the myenteric plexus account for the esophageal and gastric dysmotility syndromes that are common accompaniments of PD87; esophageal involvement, when severe, can
be indistinguishable from achalasia.90 Involvement of the

263

State of the art
colonic myenteric plexus in PD is associated with constipation and more severe forms of colonic inertia, depending on the magnitude of cell loss.86
One of the most common disturbances in PD is orthostatic hypotension, presumably resulting from the characteristic loss of preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the intermediolateral nucleus of the thoracic spinal cord.91
Destruction of postganglionic neurons within the sympathetic chain results in sympathetic denervation of the
heart, as indicated by diminished cardiac uptake of a tracer
that uses the same neuronal transport mechanism as NA.92
While the clinical effects of cardiac sympathetic denervation are unknown, the diagnostic significance may be considerable.93 Evidence of cardiac sympathetic denervation
occurs early and often in PD, but not in other forms of
parkinsonism, such as multiple system atrophy.94

Etiopathogenesis
Although the etiology and pathogenesis of sporadic PD
have yet to be established, several predisposing factors
and pathogenic pathways have been implicated. Among
the latter are oxidative stress associated with mitochondrial dysfunction,95-98 proteolytic stress due to dysfunction
of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS),99,100 and local
inflammation.101-103 These are not exclusive mechanisms;
in fact, they can be mutually reinforcing.104 Moreover,
each of the three pathways may lead to activation of the
intracellular machinery of programmed cell death
(PCD), suspected of being a final common mechanism of
the neuron loss in PD.104
The suspected causal factors in PD include environmental
toxins, particularly enhancers of oxidative stress,105-107 and

nuclear genetic defects. Evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD ensured that defective mitochondrial genes
linked to PD would be sought assiduously in PD patients,
yet to date there is still no compelling evidence for such
a link.108,109 On the other hand, studies of families in which
the inheritance of PD follows mendelian patterns have
already identified five genes in which mutations are associated with typical PD phenotypes (Table II).110,111
Genetic factors
Three of the PD-related genes—PARK1, PARK2, and
PARK5—code for proteins found in LBs.110,112 Two of
these—parkin (the product of PARK2) and UCH-L1
(the product of PARK5)—are enzymatic components of
the UPS for intracellular protein clearance.99 The third is
α-synuclein, the product of PARK1 and a presynaptic
protein that, in the fibrillar form, constitutes roughly 40%
of a typical LB.113 A fourth gene, PARK7, codes for DJ-1,
a protein linked to oxidative stress defenses and possible
chaperone functions that could help to limit misfolding
of other proteins and thereby reduce proteolytic stress.114
The fifth PD gene, NR4A2 (also known by its product’s
name, NURR1),115-117 encodes a protein that regulates
transcription of the TH gene and whose postmitotic
expression is critical to the specification and development of midbrain DA neurons.118-121 Defects in this gene
could lead to striatal DA depletion and the characteristic motor impairments of PD, but of course such mutations by themselves would not account for the neurodegenerative process in PD, which invariably extends
well beyond the midbrain and affects numerous types of
nondopaminergic cell groups (Table I).

The burgeoning linkage data related to these and other
loci have reignited interest in the possibility of identifying potential susceptibility genes122-124 that might interact
with environmental factors in polygenic fashion to produce the range phenotypes observed in nonfamilial PD.
Recent evidence suggests that some PARK5 mutations
may increase susceptibility to development of late-onset
PD,125 while others may actually decrease susceptibility.126
Thus far, however, it does not appear that single gene
mutations figure prominently in sporadic PD.127-130
Moreover, twin studies have repeatedly indicated that
heritability factors among patients with late-onset PD are
minimal to nonexistent.131,132
Environmental factors
The search for environmental factors that might initiate or
enhance the neurodegenerative process in PD intensified
following the discovery of MPTP-induced parkinsonism.
As oxidative stress had been clearly implicated in the
pathogenesis of MPTP-induced parkinsonism,14,133 it was
natural to focus to some extent on environmental oxidants
and inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration.Tetrahydroisoquinoline (TIQ) and β-carboline (β-C) derivatives, which
are structurally related to MPTP and occur naturally in
many foods, produce nigrostriatal damage in experimental animals and have been detected in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in PD patients.106,134 As with MPTP’s
conversion to MPP+, there is metabolic activation of TIQ
and β-C derivatives by conversion to quinolinium and
β-carbolinium species, respectively, which are DAT substrates and appear to be toxic to mitochondria.106,134
Pesticides have also been suggested as possible causal or
contributing factors in some cases of sporadic PD.105 Both
paraquat and rotenone are potent inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I, and both are potentially neurotoxic.135,136
While neuronal toxicity of paraquat is generally lacking in
specificity, rotenone has been shown to produce an excellent model of PD in rodents when administered chronically in low doses.137 Chronic infusions of rotenone produce
selective degeneration of nigrostriatal DA neurons and
formation of α-synuclein–positive LB-like structures,
accompanied by signs of parkinsonism.138,139 Although epidemiological studies have often suggested a linkage
between exposure to pesticides and development of
PD,140,141 the interpretability of such findings has generally
been limited by uncertainties concerning the chemical
identity, route, intensity, and duration of exposures.106,134

Oxidative stress
Signs of oxidative stress are abundant in the substantia
nigra of patients with PD.95 Mitochondrial complex I activity is depressed.142 Levels of intrinsic antioxidants, such as
glutathione, are reduced,143 while oxidized products of proteins, lipids, and DNA increase significantly.144-147 Increasing
levels of oxidative stress can eventually lead to apoptosis
through the intrinsic (or “mitochondrial”) PCD pathway
due to cytoplasmic release of cytochrome c, which is
proapoptotic, from dysfunctional mitochondria.104
Pathogenic factors peculiar to DA neurons
Factors peculiar to midbrain DA neurons may enhance
the risk of oxidative damage in SNc, though they clearly
are not essential to the neurodegenerative process, as it
affects most other vulnerable cell groups. Cytosolic DA
can increase oxidative stress within nigral neurons by several routes. Spontaneous autooxidation of DA produces
reactive DA-quinone species and the superoxide anion
(O2• -), as well as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).148 When not
sequestered in synaptic vesicles, DA can form complexes
with cysteine that inhibit mitochondrial complex I.149
Glutamatergic activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptors on SNc neurons results in Ca2+ influx
that may activate nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS),149
thereby increasing the availability of NO that could in
turn combine with the superoxide anion to produce peroxynitrite (ONOO• -), which can cause nitrative damage
to proteins, lipids, and DNA.96,150,151
In PD, there is progressive accumulation of intracellular
iron in SNc neurons and microglia.152-154 Why this occurs
is uncertain,153,155 but the excess nigral iron is likely to
enhance local oxidative stress. Ordinarily, accumulation
of tissue iron is accompanied by concomitant increases
in local ferritin levels, which serve to moderate the risk
of local redox toxicity that would otherwise be associated
with the increased iron. However, in PD, the expected
increase in local ferritin does not occur.155,156 Iron is chemically inactive when bound to ferritin as Fe3+, whereas
unbound iron in the ferrous state (Fe2+) can combine with
H2O2 in the Fenton reaction to produce the reactive
hydroxyl radical (OH•).152 This and other reactive oxygen
species (ROS) are also generated in the course of DA
metabolism and turnover.148 Activities of TH and
monoamine oxidase generate H2O2. In the presence of
ferrous iron, the superoxide anion and H2O2—two

265

State of the art
weakly reactive free radical species—can combine in the
Haber-Weiss reaction to produce the more reactive OH•
radical; this is believed to be the dominant pathway for
biological production of the OH• radical.155
Neuromelanin (NM) may play a role in nigral, and possibly LC, degeneration, but whether that role is toxic or
protective remains uncertain. In humans and nonhuman
primates, both the DA-producing neurons of SNc and the
NA-producing neurons of LC are darkly pigmented due
to perikaryal accumulation of NM within double-membraned organelles known as NM granules.152,157 NM is produced by spontaneous autooxidation of cytosolic DA and
NA in SNc and LC neurons, respectively.152 The selective
vulnerability of SNc and LC neurons in both PD and
MPTP-induced parkinsonism prompted early suggestions that NM might contribute to the neurodegenerative
process. Recent studies suggest NM may have the opposite effect, at least early in the disease. For example, it was
noted that the nigral DA neurons most susceptible to
early loss in PD—those in the ventral tier of the SNc—
typically contain lower amounts of NM than do their less
vulnerable counterparts in the dorsal tier.16 Biochemical
studies have shown that as NM is synthesized and accumulates intracellularly during the life of an SNc neuron,
it appears to be capable of binding and inactivating
redox-active metal ions (in particular Fe2+), intrinsically
generated quinones and ROS,152,158 and environmental
toxins such as paraquat.157
While SNc iron levels are still relatively low early in the
course of PD, NM contains a preponderance of highaffinity iron-binding sites that could oxidize redox-active
Fe2+ and chelate the inactive Fe3+ that results, thereby
reducing the potential for oxidative stress.157 Later, as PD
progresses and cytosolic Fe2+ concentrations rise due to
continued accumulation of intracellular iron, NM’s high
affinity iron-binding sites could become saturated, leaving only the low-affinity sites to bind redox-active Fe2+,
which they do without oxidizing it to the inactive ferric
form.152 NM-bound Fe2+ would then remain free to catalyze production of OH• radicals via the Fenton reaction.134,152,157
Proteolytic stress
A second mechanism implicated in PD pathogenesis is
proteolytic stress resulting from dysfunction of the UPS
of nonlysosomal protein degradation.99 The UPS is an
essential pathway for degradation and clearance of mis-

folded or otherwise damaged intracellular proteins.
Several converging lines of evidence suggest that protein
aggregation related to proteolytic stress could be an
important aggravating or contributing factor in the neurodegeneration of PD.
LBs, the sine qua nons of PD, are proteinaceous inclusions, of which the principal component is fibrillar
α-synuclein.159,160 The normal role of α-synuclein as a
presynaptic protein is unknown, but it may be involved
in synaptic maintenance or plasticity.161,162 Approximately
half of the α-synuclein within a presynaptic terminal
remains unfolded, as a cytosolic protein capable of binding to synaptic vesicles; the remainder is concentrated
near synaptic vesicles where it binds to plasma membranes in a predominantly α-helical form.148 These and
other properties have led to suggestions that α-synuclein
plays a role in the maintenance and recycling of synaptic
vesicles.162 As concentrations of cytosolic α-synuclein rise,
it may itself begin to have adverse effects. It may increase
demands on the UPS for protein degradation and clearance, thus enhancing proteolytic stress.163 In its native
form, α-synuclein may bind to and thus sequester an
important antiapoptotic protein, 14-3-3, thereby compromising a potential safeguard against activation of the
machinery of PCD.148 In high concentrations, unfolded
α-synuclein forms β-pleated sheets known as protofibrils,
which may be cytotoxic.164 Protofibrils may increase the
permeability of synaptic vesicles, causing leakage of DA
into the cytoplasm which increases oxidative stress.164,165
By a seeding process, protofibrils can form nontoxic fibrils of α-synuclein, which are the main constituents of
LBs.166
LBs also contain lesser amounts of several UPS-related
proteins. These include the following: (i) ubiquitin, the
peptide with which damaged proteins are tagged in
preparation for degradation by the 26S proteasome; (ii)
fragments of the 26S proteasome; (iii) the E3 ubiquitin
ligase parkin, which assists in preproteolytic ubiquination; and (iv) ubiquitin C-terminal hydroxylase L1
(UCH-L1), which removes ubiquitin for recycling following proteasomal degradation.111,148 This evidence for a
role of proteolytic stress in the pathogenesis of sporadic
PD is reinforced by the fact that mutations in the genes
coding for α-synuclein, parkin, and UCH-L1 are associated with some forms of familial PD.111,167
Oxidative stress can exacerbate proteolytic stress by
increasing the amounts of oxidized and nitrated proteins
that must be cleared by the UPS. DA-quinones produced

by spontaneous autooxidation of DA can form covalent
bonds with α-synuclein, also contributing to proteolytic
stress.148,168 DA-quinone bonding might also interfere with
α-synuclein’s putative role in maintenance and recycling
of synaptic vesicles,148,149 which could in turn result in
increased levels of unsequestered cytosolic DA thereby
enhancing oxidative stress.

to TNF receptor 1 on the surface of nearby SNc neurons,176 microglial-derived TNF-α could activate the TNF
receptor family “death domain” and thereby trigger the
extrinsic (or “death receptor”) PCD pathway leading
from initiator caspase 8 to the executioner caspases and
cell death.104 Postmortem nigral tissue in PD patients is
characterized by elevated caspase activities177 and other
indicators of PCD.178-181

Inflammation
Local inflammation is readily apparent at sites of neuron
loss in both PD and MPTP-induced parkinsonism.103,169,170
Most of the inflammatory cells at these sites are activated
microglia, although lesser numbers of reactive astrocytes
are seen as well.103,170,171 While the astrocytes are suspected
of playing an overall protective role in PD by such mechanisms as sequestration and metabolization of DA, glutathione-mediated scavenging of ROS and production of
glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), the microglia
are believed instead to facilitate the neurodegenerative
process in PD.149,155,172 Microglial accumulation and activation occurs in sites where neurons eventually die and
are lost, such as SNc. NM is known to be proinflammatory when released to the extracellular environment, as
occurs of course when NM-laden nigral neurons eventually succumb to the neurodegenerative process.149,155,172
Microglial infiltration in regions of neuron loss could
therefore represent merely a secondary response to the
presence of dead and dying neurons.149,155 Yet experimental studies in toxin-induced animal models suggest that
such inflammation also plays a causal role in the neurodegenerative process inasmuch as they show that death
of SNc neurons can be averted by treatment with antiinflammatory agents.103
Activated microglia appear to be the main source of
increased levels of inducible NOS (iNOS) in parkinsonian nigra.104 Induction of iNOS is associated with sustained increases in local NO production.173 NO can diffuse readily across cell membranes to enter nearby SNc
neurons, where it could combine with locally produced
superoxide anion to produce peroxynitrite, exacerbating
nitration-induced damage to intracellular lipids, proteins,
and DNA in nigral neurons.151,174
Activated microglia also produce cytokines capable of
amplifying the local inflammatory response by activating
still more microglia in the vicinity.175 Several of these,
including tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), have been
identified in nigral tissue of PD patients.175,176 By binding

Implications of pathogenesis for neuroprotective
therapy
Current understanding of the pathogenesis of PD implies
that appropriate neuroprotective therapies aimed at
reducing oxidative or proteolytic stress, blocking the
putative toxic effects of microglial activation, or promoting neuronal growth and repair, should be effective
in preventing, slowing, or reversing both the underlying
neurodegenerative process and the natural progression
of the disease. Such therapies could include antioxidants,
anti-inflammatory agents, neuronal growth factor infusions, and neural “transplant” procedures, as well as
potential gene therapies and pharmacological interventions targeting enhancement of intracellular protein
clearance or suppression of PCD pathways. To date, these
approaches have had little success in achieving the
intended outcomes. We still have no proven neuroprotective or restorative therapies that prevent, slow, or
reverse the neurodegeneration or progression of PD,
despite concerted efforts to develop such measures over
the past two decades.182,183 It remains uncertain, therefore,
whether any of the pathogenic mechanisms proposed to
date has a primary role in disease initiation, although it
does seem likely that all, when present, could contribute
to disease progression. This suggests that current models
of the pathogenesis of PD remain incomplete. Such is the
case especially for those predisposing factors that may be
selective for nigral DA neurons. The roles of iron and
NM, and the toxic effects of DA metabolism in SNc neurons, do not explain the similar pathology in other cell
groups such as dorsal glossopharyngeus-vagus complex
or the intermediolateral column of spinal cord.
Various experimental strategies—including pharmacological and gene-based therapies aimed at reducing
oxidative or proteolytic stress or inflammation or reversing defective neurogenesis—do protect against genetic
or toxin-induced parkinsonism in certain animal models.184 Such protection, however, often requires that the

267

State of the art
therapy has been in place at or before the time of toxic
exposure or expression of toxic alleles. This may account
in part for the lack of effective neuroprotective strategies
in human PD, as these can only be tested in subjects if
they already have the disease.182,185 Nonetheless, until we
are able to intervene directly in the neurodegenerative
process by blocking one or more of the implicated pathogenic pathways, the causative role of these mechanisms
in human disease will remain uncertain.

Pathophysiology of motor dysfunction
While the neurodegenerative process in PD affects multiple neuromodulator systems and diverse groups of neurons at many levels of the neuraxis (Table I), the characteristic motor impairments in this disorder appear to result
primarily, if not exclusively, from depletion of striatal DA
caused by selective degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons.
There is compelling evidence for this view, including the
striking effectiveness of DA agonists and antagonists in
respectively ameliorating and exacerbating the motor
deficits of PD, and the corresponding lack of effect on such
deficits of agonists and antagonists of NA or 5-HT, the
other two monoamines that are depleted in this disease.
Depletion of striatal DA in human PD and in the nonhuman primate model of MPTP-induced parkinsonism is
associated with specific changes in neuronal activity patterns in the motor circuitry of the basal ganglia, including
increased rates of neuronal discharge within the main output nucleus of the basal ganglia, Gpi, and in the STN, and
minimally decreased discharge in the globus pallidus pars
externa (GPe).186-188 Administration of dopaminergic agents
results in normalization of neuronal activity and reversal
of motor impairment.188,189 Fiber-sparing ablation190 or muscimol-induced inactivation of STN191 reverses the motor
deficits of monkeys made parkinsonian with MPTP.
Radiofrequency lesioning192,193 or high-frequency electrical
stimulation—deep brain stimulation (DBS)—of the motor
territory of GPi194,195 provides effective treatment for all of
the primary motor impairments of patients with PD. DBS
applied to STN194,196,197 is also effective in restoring normal
movement control to PD patients. Some patients have
been treated successfully with subtotal STN lesions198-200—
however, the added risk of persistent hemiballismus201,202
with this approach serves to lessen its appeal.
It would be difficult to exaggerate the complexity of the
interconnected cortical, basal ganglia, and thalamic neuronal networks affected by the depletion of striatal DA

in PD. These networks comprise multiple layers and side
loops, vast numbers of neuronal elements, and a wide
range of neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, axonal and
dendritic branching patterns, and layer-to-layer connectivity. Nonetheless, from a large-scale perspective, these
same networks can be viewed more simply as an array of
contiguous but functionally specialized pathways linking
basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebral cortex in circular
fashion to form a corresponding family of parallel, partially closed and largely segregated basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits or loops.203-207
According to this schema, each loop takes its origin from
a particular set of anatomically and functionally related
cortical fields (sensorimotor, oculomotor, dorsolateral
prefrontal, ventromedial prefrontal, limbic), passing
through the corresponding portions of the basal ganglia,
and returning to parts of those same cortical fields by
way of specific basal ganglia–recipient zones in the dorsal thalamus. To the extent that information processing
remains functionally segregated throughout the course
of each loop, each subserves a different set of behavioral
functions. Thus, the sensorimotor and oculomotor circuits
participate in the control of skeletal and ocular movements, respectively; dorsolateral prefrontal and ventromedial prefrontal circuits subserve executive/visuospatial and behavioral set-switching functions, respectively;
and the limbic circuit contributes to emotional processing. Evidence supporting this schema comes from both
humans and nonhuman primates.203,208-210
Due to maintained segregation along each of these corticobasal ganglia–thalamocortical circuits, there is limited
direct communication among the separate functional
domains, except by way of corticocortical interactions.
While essentially the entire cortical mantle is mapped
topographically onto the striatum210—which is often considered the “input” portion of the basal ganglia—the cortically directed signals from the basal ganglia output nuclei
(internal pallidum and SNr) are returned exclusively to
foci within the frontal lobe (after first passing through the
corresponding portions of the thalamus.) Because of the
parallel organization of these circuits, the operations performed at corresponding stations (eg, striatum, pallidum,
thalamus) are predicted to be similar.Accordingly, clarification of how the motor circuit operates may be relevant
to our understanding of how the other circuits might function. On the basis of what is already known or suspected
about the functions subserved by each circuit in the normal state, multiple studies have begun to address predic-

268

tions that some of those functions may be lost in PD due
to impaired information processing caused by depletion
of striatal DA (Table III).193,209,211-223
The pathophysiology of motor dysfunction in PD has
been clarified recently by advances on several fronts,
including physiological studies in animal models of
parkinsonism, neuronal recordings and DBS in humans
with PD, functional brain imaging in PD patients, and
computational modeling of neuronal circuitry. To understand these developments, it is useful to consider the
functional organization of basal ganglia motor circuitry
in some detail.
Role of DA in basal ganglia circuitry
DA has a pivotal and extremely complex role in controlling the flow of information through the basal ganglia.
SNc provides dopaminergic innervation to the entire
neostriatum, including the motor territory within the
putamen. Through an intricate web of presynaptic and
postsynaptic connections, nigrostriatal neurons modulate
the responsiveness of striatal projection neurons—
medium spiny neurons (MSNs)—to converging glutamatergic inputs from cortex and thalamus and local
GABAergic feedback from neighboring MSNs. The
nigrostriatal pathway provides an extraordinarily dense
dopaminergic input to each MSN, comparable in magnitude to the 5000 or so corticostriatal synapses that individual MSNs receive.224-226 Dopaminergic terminals from
SNc form postsynaptic axospinous and axodendritic
synapses with MSNs, and presynaptic axoaxonic synapses
with the terminal boutons of corticostriatal fibers, which
synapse mainly on the spines of MSNs.44,226,227
Unlike the fast-acting neurotransmitters glutamate and
GABA, DA does not itself cause depolarization or
hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane.228 As a
slow-acting neurotransmitter, or neuromodulator, DA’s

synaptic effects unfold over hundreds of milliseconds and
may last a minute or more. In contrast, glutamate and
GABA, when acting through ionotropic receptors, produce their corresponding depolarizing and hyperpolarizing postsynaptic effects within a millisecond of binding
to their individual receptors, and these effects last only
from about a millisecond to a few tens of milliseconds,
respectively.
DA receptors belong to the A family of seven-transmembrane receptors and are grouped into two subclasses, d1 and d2, based on their coupling to G-proteins
that either increase (d1-like) or decrease (d2-like) cytoplasmic cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).229 The
d1 subclass includes the d1 and d5 receptors, and the d2
subclass comprises d2, d3, and d4 receptors.229 DA’s synaptic actions are mediated through intracellular signaling
pathways that regulate the phosphorylation of DARPP32 (DA and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, molecular weight = 32 kda), which in turn controls the sensitivity of glutamate and GABA receptors.230 By controlling
the particular sites and level of DARPP-32 phosphorylation, DA exerts an indirect but powerful influence over
the efficacy of converging synaptic actions of the fast-acting neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA.231 This control is imposed through DARPP-32’s regulation of the
phosphorylation of synaptic receptors for these and other
neurotransmitters. Activation of d1-like receptors leads
to increased phosphorylation—and hence increased sensitivity—of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionic acid) and NMDA glutamate receptors
as well as GABAA receptors.231 Activation of d2-like
receptors leads to the opposite effect: decreased phosphorylation and sensitivity of AMPA, NMDA, and
GABAA receptors to their respective agonists. DARPP32 is heavily concentrated within the spines of MSNs.232,233
While nigrostriatal DA neurons send topographical projections to restricted foci within the striatum, the stria-

tonigral input they receive in turn is convergent, arising
from much broader segments of the striatum than the circumscribed territories they themselves innervate.234 For
example, ventrolateral SNc DA neurons that project
selectively to the sensorimotor territory within the putamen receive striatonigral input not only from putamen
but from associative (caudate nucleus) and limbic striatum as well.234 This multimodal striatal input may account
for the remarkable fact that the activity of midbrain DA
neurons appears to encode a secondary reinforcement
signal distilled in real time from complex contingencies
implicit in a subject’s ongoing behavior. In nonhuman
primates performing tasks with variable probability of
reward, transient deviations in the otherwise monotonous discharge patterns of midbrain DA neurons reflect
the subject’s realized error in predicting the future probability of behavioral reinforcement.235 Discharge rates of
midbrain DA neurons briefly increase when the subject
receives positive reinforcement that had not been
expected, and decrease when positive reinforcement that
had been expected is not received.236 When the primary
reinforcement (eg, food or liquid reward) has become
associated with a conditioned stimulus, the change in discharge rate will be linked to the unexpected presence or
absence of the conditioned stimulus rather than that of
the primary reward. This type of signal has been used
successfully in certain types of adaptive neural networks
that incorporate an “adaptive critic” to support
autonomous learning.237 In an analogous manner, by
encoding such a signal, nigrostriatal DA neurons could
play an important role in learning by broadcasting the
optimal times at which striatal synapses should be
strengthened or weakened. In fact, the signal itself might
initiate the process required for changing synaptic
strength. This would be consistent with the demonstration that DARPP-32 phosphorylation triggered by activation of d1-like receptors is critical for the induction of
both long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in striatal neurons.238
Direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways
The striatum is often designated as the input (or afferent) division of the basal ganglia because it receives nonreciprocated corticostriatal projections from essentially
all areas of cerebral cortex.208,239-251 Approximately half of
the striatal MSNs project directly to the basal ganglia
output nuclei, GPi, and SNr,252-260 which in turn send non-

reciprocated projections to the thalamus.261-268 The remaining MSNs do not directly innervate the output nuclei, but
project instead to an intervening nucleus, GPe.253 While
all MSNs are GABAergic, they form two distinct (though
intermingled) populations that are differentiated by their
connectivity and by the particular neuromodulators they
produce.253,256,269,270 The MSNs that give rise to the “direct
pathway” contain substance P and dynorphin and project
directly to the output nuclei (GPi/SNr). Those that give
rise to the “indirect pathway” contain enkephalin and
project to the GPe.
The indirect pathway has two arms. The GABAergic
neurons of GPe project to STN,271 whose excitatory, glutamatergic neurons send feedforward connections to
GPi/SNr to complete one arm of the indirect pathway,
and feedback connections to GPe.272,273 A second arm of
the indirect pathway is formed by GPe projections that
pass directly to GPi/SNr.269,270 A remarkable consequence
of this arrangement is that activation of MSNs associated
with either of the two arms will tend to increase neuronal
activity at the level of GPi/SNr, in one case by disinhibiting the STN along with its excitatory projections to
GPi/SNr, and in the other by disinhibiting GPi/SNr
directly. In contrast, activation of MSNs associated with
the direct pathway should decrease basal ganglia output
by directly suppressing activity at the level of GPi/SNr.
Given the reentrant nature of basal ganglia–thalamocortical connections, cortically initiated activation of the
direct pathway should therefore result in positive feedback at cortical levels, due to thalamic disinhibition.
Conversely, cortically initiated activation of the indirect
pathway should have the opposite effect, due to the
polarity-reversing effects of an intercalated stage of processing within GABAergic GPe.
The direct and indirect pathways differ sharply in their
connections with the intralaminar thalamus. The basal
ganglia output nuclei, GPi and SNr, send GABAergic
pallidothalamic and nigrothalamic projections to the centromedian (CM) and parafascicular (Pf) nuclei, respectively, as well as to the corresponding pallidal and nigral
target zones in the ventrolateral or “motor” thalamus.264,274
Thalamostriatal projections from CM innervate the postcommissural (sensorimotor) putamen, while those from
Pf are directed to the precommissural (associative) putamen, caudate nucleus, and ventral striatum.261 The projections from CM to putamen show considerable selectivity in their terminal ramifications. They maintain strict
topographical mappings that link corresponding thalamo-

270

Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience - Vol 6 . No. 3 . 2004

striatal, striatopallidal, and pallidothalamic projection
zones in CM, putamen, and GPi, respectively.261
Moreover, thalamostriatal axons of CM neurons terminate almost exclusively on the spines and dendrites of
putaminal MSNs that project to GPi, while avoiding
those that project to GPe.253
The neuromodulatory effects of DA on the integrative
activity of striatal MSNs differ considerably for the direct
and indirect pathways, due to the dissimilar distributions
of d1-like and d2-like receptors on the two types of
MSNs.227,270 Multiple studies have shown that substance P–
containing, GPi/SNr–projecting striatal neurons of the
direct pathway express a preponderance of d1-like receptors, while enkephalin-containing, GPe-projecting neurons
of the indirect pathway express a higher proportion of d2like receptors227,275-277 despite variable degrees of colocalization of the two receptor types among a subset of each
of the two categories of striatal projection neurons.278
The direct- and indirect-projecting MSNs also differ with
respect to their responses to ACh, due to differences in
the muscarinic receptors they express. Both types of
MSNs express m1 receptors to comparable degrees.224
However, m4 receptors are expressed predominantly by
the substance P–containing neurons of the direct pathway.279 Like the DA receptors, muscarinic receptors
belong to the A family of seven-transmembrane receptors, and the G-protein to which the m4 receptor is coupled acts to decrease cAMP levels, making its neuromodulatory effect analogous to that of d2-like receptors.
Although the striatum does receive limited extrinsic
input from the cholinergic PPN,58,280 by far the largest
source of striatal ACh is the intrinsic population of large,
aspiny interneurons.281,282 Unlike putaminal MSNs, these
large interneurons are spontaneously active and they do
not discharge in relation to specific parameters of movement preparation or execution, such as direction or force,
although they do show selectivity for the mode of movement guidance (eg, self-initiated versus visually guided
versus memory-guided).283 Rather, they discharge briefly
and synchronously following the presentation of a conditioned sensory stimulus that signifies the imminent
delivery of a reward.284,285 In this respect, their behavior is
similar to that of nigrostriatal DA neurons. And yet, there
is a crucial difference: cholinergic interneurons signal the
subject’s prediction that a reward is imminent, while DA
neurons signal reward prediction errors.286,287 The cholinergic large aspiny neurons are the only striatal cells that
express significant levels of the m2 receptor,224 which—

like the m4 receptor—is coupled to a G-protein that
decreases intracellular cAMP. The m2 receptors are concentrated on cholinergic axons of aspiny interneurons
that form symmetric synapses on the proximal dendrites
and cell bodies of MSNs.224
Pathophysiology of nigrostriatal DA depletion in the
motor circuit
The data recounted above are consistent with the relatively simple functional models of basal ganglia circuitry
developed throughout the 1990s to provide a framework
for approaching the pathophysiology of motor dysfunction in PD.188,204,288 These models typically emphasized the
opposing actions of the direct and indirect pathways in
determining the level of thalamic inhibition exerted by
the basal ganglia output nuclei. Studies of MPTP-induced
parkinsonism had revealed increased tonic discharge
rates in GPi and SNr neurons as well as in STN, and
decreased rates of discharge in GPe.186,187,190 This suggested
that excessive inhibition of the thalamic targets to which
GPi and SNr projected might be the basis for the hypokinesia and rigidity of parkinsonism.188 Reduced dopaminergic activation of d1-like receptors on striatal-GPi/SNr
spiny neurons would reduce the effectiveness of their
glutamatergic inputs from cortex and CM/Pf, leading to
disinhibition of GPi/SNr. Reduced dopaminergic activation of d2-like receptors on striatal-GPe neurons would
increase the effectiveness of their glutamatergic inputs,
leading to increase inhibition of GPe, which would in
turn disinhibit STN. The resulting increase in glutamatergic drive from STN would further increase the
activity of GPi/SNr neurons, further depressing thalamocortical activity. Perhaps the opposite effect, excessively
low levels of tonic basal ganglia outflow, was the basis for
certain hyperkinetic disorders, including levodopainduced dyskinesia.
The effectiveness of GPi and STN lesions or functional
inactivation in relieving parkinsonism in MPTP-treated
monkeys,190,191,289-291 and motor dysfunction in patients with
PD,192,193,195-198,292,293 was consistent with predictions of thalamic disinhibition models based on mean firing rates of
basal ganglia neurons. Still, the models were unable to
account for a number of observations that had emerged
from experimental and clinical studies.294,295 To begin with,
the fact that GPi lesions relieved hypokinesia without
inducing dyskinesia had never been satisfactorily
accounted for by simple firing rate models; yet one of the

271

State of the art
most reliable benefits of the medial pallidotomy procedure was reduction or elimination of levodopa-induced
dyskinesia.192,296 Models based on firing rates predicted
that lesions of GPe would produce parkinsonism by disinhibiting both STN and GPi, but this was not confirmed.297,298 According to these same models, lesions of
the pallidothalamic projection zone in ventrolateral
(motor) thalamus should result in hypokinesia or akinesia; but such was not the case.299,300 Finally, simple models
based on firing rates could not explain why tremor was
such a prominent feature of PD. Tremor-like bursting of
basal ganglia and thalamic neurons had been observed
throughout the 1990s in nonhuman primates with MPTPinduced parkinsonism186,301-303 and in PD patients undergoing microelectrode-guided neurosurgical procedures,
but it was not known whether the bursting contributed
to—or was caused by—the parkinsonian state. Recent
electrophysiological and computational modeling studies have helped to clarify the situation.
These newer approaches have focused on dynamic features of neuronal activity changes in PD—such as oscillatory bursting and synchronization of discharge among
neighboring neurons—rather than static features such as
mean firing rates. Recordings in PD patients and primates with experimental parkinsonism reveal low-frequency (4-30 Hz) oscillatory field potentials and rhythmic neuronal bursting in both STN and GPe.298,301,304,305
Neurons in both structures show correlated discharge in
the parkinsonian state.306 Effective symptomatic treatment with dopaminergic medication reduces or abolishes
the low-frequency oscillatory activity as well as the correlations among neurons.307
STN and GPe have strong reciprocal connections that are
functionally antagonistic, the glutamatergic output of STN
being excitatory, while the GABAergic output of GPe is
inhibitory. Recent anatomical studies have demonstrated
remarkably tight functional and topographic mapping of
homologous territories in the reciprocal connections of
STN and GPe (as well as in the respective projections that
each of these nuclei sends to GPi).269 Brain slice and in vivo
studies have shown that phasic activation of GPe neurons
results in powerful GABAA-mediated inhibition of their
STN targets followed by postinhibitory rebound excitation
of STN neurons whose glutamatergic return projections
then reactivate their targets in GPe.308,309 This endows the
GPe-STN-GPe circuitry with a propensity to sustain synchronized, oscillatory discharges between and within the

two nuclei.308-310 Neurons in both nuclei have inherent
rhythmic potential due in part to low-threshold T-type Ca2+
currents that predispose the cells to rebound excitation;
such conductances are known to underlie many forms of
pacemaker activity.311-314 The predilection for oscillatory
interactions between GPe and STN is normally restrained
by powerful local GABAergic feedback that desynchronizes the output of neighboring neurons in GPe.315,316
These and other connectional and biophysical properties
of the GPe-STN network have been incorporated into
dynamic computational models that successfully reproduce and illuminate much of the pathophysiology of
oscillatory activity observed in PD and MPTP-induced
parkinsonism.317 Such models show, for example, that
increased striatal activity along the indirect pathway can
lead to oscillatory activity in the GPe-STN network by
two concurrent mechanisms. Increased GABAergic striatal input to GPe will reduce the latter’s tonic
GABAergic suppression of STN activity, allowing the
oscillatory potential of the reciprocal antagonism
between GPe and STN to be expressed.317 Accompanying
the increased release of GABA at striatoGPe synapses
will be a corresponding increase in the release of colocalized enkephalin.256,318 Local diffusion of enkephalin
within GPe will lead to presynaptic suppression of
GABA release not only at the striatoGPe terminals
themselves, but also at the sites of local GABAergic feedback from neighboring GPe neurons318; the net effect of
this reduced lateral inhibition will be enhanced synchronization among the GPe-STN projection cells.317
The recent incorporation of dynamic features of neuronal interactions into the ever more complex functional
models of basal ganglia circuitry317 permits us now to
account for most if not all of the observed motor dysfunction in PD. With the demonstrable linkage between
motor deficits and abnormal oscillatory activity, and
growing understanding of how the oscillatory activity
arises naturally under conditions of striatal DA depletion, it seems we are approaching the point of having a
reasonably comprehensive and testable theory of the
pathophysiology of PD. Much of the testing can and
should be carried out in experimental studies of basal
ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry in MPTP-induced
parkinsonism. Some will likely be incidental to attempts
to refine and improve current symptomatic therapies,
both pharmacological and neurosurgical, in patients with
PD. ❏

patogénesis y fisiopatología de un trastorno
neurodegenerativo multisistémico

Biologie de la maladie de Parkinson :
pathogenèse et physiopathologie d’un
trouble neurodégénératif multisystémique

La enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es el segundo
trastorno del movimiento más frecuente. Los característicos deterioros motores –bradiquinesia, rigidez
y temblor de reposo– se deben a la pérdida degenerativa de neuronas dopaminérgicas mesencefálicas en la sustancia nigra, y responden a tratamiento
sintomático con fármacos dopaminérgicos y neurocirugía funcional. La EP es también el segundo trastorno neurodegenerativo más común. Desde esta
perspectiva, la EP es un trastorno de múltiples sistemas funcionales, no simplemente del sistema
motor, y de múltiples sistemas de neurotransmisión,
y no sólo de dopamina. La patología característica
–inclusiones intraneuronales de cuerpos de Lewy y
un número reducido de neuronas sobrevivientes–
es similar en cada uno de los grupos de neuronas,
lo que sugiere un proceso neurodegenerativo
común. Estudios experimentales y de patología
indican que el estrés oxidativo, el estrés proteolítico
y la inflamación destacan notablemente en la patogénesis de la EP. Todavía no se conoce si alguno de
estos mecanismos juega un papel causal en la EP del
ser humano, porque a la fecha no se han probado
terapias neuroprotectoras que retrasen o reviertan
la progresión de la enfermedad en pacientes con
EP. Estamos comenzando a comprender la fisiopatología de la disfunción motora en la EP, pero su
etiopatogénesis como un trastorno neurodegenerativo continúa poco comprendido.

La maladie de Parkinson (MP) est le deuxième trouble moteur le plus fréquent. Les dysfonctionnements moteurs caractéristiques – bradykinésie, rigidité, et tremblement de repos – sont la
conséquence d’une perte dégénérative de neurones dopaminergiques du locus niger dans le mésencéphale et sont sensibles au traitement symptomatique par des médicaments dopaminergiques et à
la neurochirurgie fonctionnelle. La MP est aussi le
deuxième trouble neurodégénératif le plus fréquent. Vue sous cet angle, la MP est un trouble de
plusieurs systèmes fonctionnels, pas seulement le
système moteur, et de multiples systèmes de neuromédiateurs, et pas simplement le système dopaminergique. La pathologie caractéristique – inclusions intraneuronales à corps de Lewy et nombre
réduit de neurones survivants – est semblable dans
chacun des groupes de neurones ciblés, suggérant
un processus neurodégénératif commun. Les études expérimentales et de pathologie montrent que
le stress oxydatif, le stress protéolytique et l’inflammation occupent une place importante dans la
pathogenèse de la MP. Jusqu’à présent on ignore si
l’un de ces mécanismes joue un rôle causal dans la
MP chez l’homme, car à ce jour, nous n’avons aucun
traitement neuroprotecteur ayant prouvé son efficacité qui ralentisse ou s’oppose à la progression de
la maladie chez les parkinsoniens. Nous commençons à comprendre la physiopathologie du dysfonctionnement moteur dans la MP, mais son étiopathogenèse en tant que trouble neurodégénératif
reste mal comprise.
