The functions of animal microRNAs

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that regulate the expression of complementary messenger RNAs. Hundreds
of miRNA genes have been found in diverse animals, and many of these are phylogenetically conserved. With
miRNA roles identified in developmental timing, cell death, cell proliferation, haematopoiesis and patterning of
the nervous system, evidence is mounting that animal miRNAs are more numerous, and their regulatory impact
more pervasive, than was previously suspected.

N

oncoding’ or ‘non-messenger’ RNAs are
diverse molecules with structural, enzymatic
and regulatory functions. Among those with
regulatory activity are miRNAs, which are
about 22 nucleotides in length and found in all
metazoa studied so far1. Of the 100–200 genes for distinct
miRNAs1 minimally contained in animal genomes, only a
handful have known functions (Table 1). However, these
functions suggest that miRNAs are important for the control
of animal development and physiology.
As regulators of gene expression, miRNAs can work by
essentially two modes2–7. In plants, miRNAs base pair with
messenger RNA targets by precise or nearly precise complementarity, and direct cleavage and destruction of the target
mRNA through a mechanism involving the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery6,7 (see review in this issue by Meister
and Tuschl, page 343). In contrast, most animal miRNAs are
imprecisely complementary to their mRNA targets (Fig. 1),
and they inhibit protein synthesis through an unknown
mechanism that preserves the stability of the mRNA target:
some studies even suggest that the translationally repressed
target mRNAs remain associated with ribosomes8,9.
Most miRNA genes seem to be solitary, and are expressed
under the control of their own promoters and regulatory
sequences. Other miRNA genes are arranged in clusters, and
may be co-regulated with other members of the cluster.
The Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes each
contain at least 100 different miRNA genes10–15, and vertebrate genomes contain about 250 miRNA genes, as shown by
complementary DNA cloning16,17 and computational predictions18. Some miRNAs are abundant, with an estimated
10,000 molecules per cell15, whereas others are only just
detectable by hybridization to total RNA samples.
Here, we focus on recent findings from genomic
experiments, whereby large numbers of miRNA genes are
identified by cDNA sequencing and computational
approaches; forward genetic experiments, whereby mutant
genes are isolated from an organism showing abnormal
phenotypic characteristics; and reverse genetic experiments, whereby a specific gene is knocked out (and/or
overexpressed) to identify its function. These three
approaches have identified roles for animal miRNA genes
in the regulation of animal development and physiology
(Fig. 2). Recently published computational predictions of
potential targets of vertebrate and insect miRNAs will also
be discussed.

identifying miRNA genes with critical roles in the regulation
of development and physiology (Fig. 2). The canonical
miRNA genes, lin-4 and let-7 of C. elegans, were first identified by loss-of-function mutations that cause defects in
developmental timing in the worm larvae19,20. lin-4 and let-7
were then cloned on the basis of their mutant phenotypes,
and the genes were found to encode small (21–22
nucleotide) noncoding RNAs that are processed from hairpin precursors. These hairpin precursors are a characteristic
feature of the miRNA class of regulatory RNAs21. Regulatory
targets of the lin-4 and let-7 miRNAs were identified from
the genetic analysis of other genes with developmental
timing phenotypes22–24.
Two Drosophila miRNA genes have been identified by
forward genetics. Screens for mutants defective in the regulation of programmed cell death and/or cell proliferation
in the developing fly led to the identification of the bantam
locus25. When this was cloned, it was found to encode a
miRNA26. Similar genetic screens identified a locus affecting
cell death and fat storage in the fly, which when cloned, was
found to correspond to the mir-14 gene27. The bantam mutant
phenotype included increased frequency of apoptosis. So
genes with known roles in regulating the apoptotic pathway
were prime candidates for bantam targets. The pro-apoptotic
gene hid was discovered to contain sequences of partial
complementarity to bantam, and in vivo tests supported a
direct role for bantam in controlling Hid protein synthesis
during development of the fly imaginal discs26. The targets for
mir-14 in the control of apoptosis have not been identified
yet, but may include cell-death effectors other than hid 27.
An exciting advance in the identification of developmental
roles for animal miRNAs came from recent studies of genetic
pathways controlling the asymmetric specification of certain
neuronal cell types in C. elegans28–30. Part of the worm’s
sensory discriminatory system, which allows worms to distinguish various attractive or repellent chemical stimuli in
their environment, consists of two asymmetric chemosensory
neurons: ASE left (ASEL) and ASE right (ASER). These two

Forward genetic analysis of miRNA function
Despite the success of cDNA cloning and bioinformatics
approaches in identifying hundreds of miRNA genes, forward
genetics remains one of the most fruitful approaches for

genetic screen that used ASEL- or ASER-specific GFP markers to
directly assay for cell-fate transformations in mutants. Second, the
difficulty of detecting such a scarce RNA as lsy-6 by hybridization
compelled Johnson and Hobert29 to use unusual genetic experiments
to prove that the lsy-6 transcript forms a miRNA hairpin structure. In
their approach, compensatory mutations were introduced into the
lsy-6 locus, and the mutant genes were then tested for function in
vivo. The wild-type lsy-6 sequence containing the putative miRNA
hairpin structure rescued the lsy-6 mutant phenotype, but a single
point mutation designed to disrupt the predicted hairpin and prevent processing of the mature miRNA eliminated rescuing activity.
Combining the original mutation with a compensatory mutation
that was predicted to restore the hairpin structure restored rescuing
activity. This provided strong genetic evidence that lsy-6 functions as
a hairpin RNA that is probably processed to a miRNA.

The lin-4 miRNA is shown with its complementary sites in lin-14 (a) and lin-28 (b).

neurons detect different compounds, and together, allow the animal
to respond selectively to stimuli. This behavioural specificity is in part
rooted in differences in gene expression between ASEL and ASER.
ASEL expresses one chemoreceptor gene, gcy-7, and ASER expresses
another, gcy-5 (Fig. 3). Genes encoding transcription factors (including cog-1, lim-6 and ceh-36) that control the specification of ASEL
and ASER asymmetry were identified by screens for mutants with
either two ASEL cells or two ASER cells (as judged by gcy-7::GFP
(where GFP is green fluorescent protein) or gcy-5::GFP expression28).
When one gene identified in these screens, lsy-6, was cloned, it was
found to be unusual in that it does not encode a protein, but instead
produces a novel miRNA29 that regulates the synthesis of a downstream transcription factor COG-1. The predicted lsy-6 transcript is
a hairpin RNA with partial complementarity to a sequence in the 3
untranslated region (UTR) of cog-1 mRNA: these sequences can
mediate lsy-6-dependent repression of cog-1 in transgenic worms29.
The discovery of the lsy-6 miRNA is remarkable in several respects.
First, lsy-6 probably could not be identified except by forward genetics.
The lsy-6 miRNA was not detected by cDNA cloning, and had not
emerged from computational predictions of worm miRNAs11,31,
presumably because its relatively low contribution to worm total
RNA meant its expression was not confirmed by northern-blot
hybridization. Because lsy-6 functions in a specific cell type, and a
loss-of-function mutation results in a very subtle behavioural
phenotype, the discovery of this particular miRNA gene required a

The discovery of lsy-6 by forward genetics suggests that other
interesting miRNA genes remain to be identified in C. elegans and
other animals. An alternative to forward genetics for identifying rare
miRNAs with developmental roles is to start with computationallypredicted miRNA genes and test for function by reverse genetics
(Fig. 2). Remarkably, the latter approach has identified a second
miRNA, mir-273, in the same pathway as lsy-6 (ref. 30). mir-273 is
also a rare miRNA in the worm, and so was not found by cDNA
cloning. Instead, mir-273 was predicted computationally in a screen
for phylogenetically conserved hairpin-forming sequences31. Computational methods for finding miRNAs are the ideal complement to
cDNA cloning, which works best for relatively abundant miRNAs.
However, a limitation of computational approaches is that predicted noncoding RNAs must be validated by an assay that can
confirm expression of the RNA. Indeed, the number of worm miRNA
candidates predicted computationally has far exceeded the number
whose expression can be confirmed11,31. A polymerase chain reaction
with reverse transcription (RT–PCR)-based assay had to be used to
detect the rare mir-273 RNA in worm total RNA samples31.
The function of mir-273 in worm neural development was discovered by the molecular characterization of the same pathway as
that which involves lsy-6 genes regulating ASER and ASEL sensory
neuron asymmetry in the worm head. In addition to the lsy-6 miRNA
gene, and the cog-1 homeobox target of lsy-6, several other genes were
identified by mutations that alter the specification of ASEL and
ASER. Among these was die-1, a gene encoding a zinc-finger transcription factor. The die-1 promoter is active in both neurons, but far
more DIE-1 protein (assayed using GFP-tagged DIE-1 expressed
from a transgene) accumulates in ASEL than in ASER30. Apparently,
the die-1 gene is regulated post-transcriptionally, and expressed
specifically in ASEL. No candidate regulatory gene upstream of die-1
was identified by mutation, but die-1 mRNA was found to contain
sequences that are complementary to parts of mir-273. Evidence that
mir-273 could be the repressor of die-1 in ASER came from the use of
transgenes expressing GFP from mir-273 upstream sequences. In this
way, mir-273 regulatory elements that drove expression specifically
in ASER were identified. No mir-273 loss-of-function mutations
were available, but ectopic expression of mir-273 in ASEL, where its
promoter is normally inactive, resulted in the transformation of
ASEL into ASER30.
The identification of two miRNAs in the ASEL/ASER pathway
suggests that many developmental regulatory pathways, like the
heterochronic and the ASEL/ASER pathways, involve several translational-regulatory steps involving miRNAs. Other miRNAs with very
restricted expression patterns undoubtedly remain to be identified by
forward genetics and carefully designed phenotypic assays, or by computational prediction followed by more sensitive expression assays.
cDNA cloning of rare, developmentally expressed miRNAs is aided
by starting with RNA samples from material enriched for specific
organs or cell types. For example, a set of six clustered mouse miRNAs

(miR-290 to miR-295) are expressed specifically in embryonic stem
(ES) cells32 and therefore, would not easily be cloned from
differentiated tissues. Similarly, miR-181 was identified by cloning
from selected adult organs17,33, and the role of miR-181 in
haematopoiesis development was indicated by its substantial
enrichment in cDNA libraries made from mouse bone marrow and
thymus33. Consistent with its being cloned from these tissues, miR-181
is expressed chiefly in bone-marrow B cells, and in thymus (presumably in T cells)33.
Although miR-181 loss-of-function mutations have not yet been
isolated, Chen et al.33 used a retroviral-based vector and an overexpression strategy to test whether miR-181 specifically affects B-cell or
T-cell development. Cells were extracted from mouse bone marrow,
sorted by cell-type markers, and then infected with virus that had
been engineered to overexpress miR-181, or other control miRNAs.
Overexpression of miR-181 in bone-marrow haematopoietic progenitor cells increased the numbers of B cells produced in vitro and in
vivo and resulted in decreased numbers of CD8+ T cells33. Although
overexpression experiments must be interpreted with care when trying
to infer the normal function of a gene, the Chen et al.33 results suggest
a role for miR-181 in the normal development of B-cell and T-cell
lineages in the mouse. miR-181 may be a component of the trigger
that directs bone-marrow progenitors along the B-cell differentiation
pathway. For thymic T cells, miR-181 seems to have a modulatory role
in population homeostasis, perhaps as a sensor for signals that regulate the number of T cells. One prediction from these findings is that
knockout of miR-181 in haematopoietic lineages will lead to fewer B
cells and an excess of thymic T cells.

miRNA gene clusters
A prominent characteristic of animal miRNAs is that their genes are
often organized in tandem, and are closely clustered on the
genome10,32. In many cases, such clustered miRNAs are probably
processed from the same polycistronic precursor transcript (a single
mRNA molecule produced from the transcription of several tandemly
arranged genes). When clustered miRNAs are of similar sequence, the
cohort of gene products may contribute additively to the regulation
of a set of mRNA targets. Clusters can also contain miRNAs of distinct sequences, suggesting that in these cases distinct miRNAs are
coordinately deployed towards their various targets. For example, in
insects and in vertebrate genomes, let-7 and miR-125 (orthologues of
C. elegans let-7 and lin-4, respectively) are closely clustered in tandem.
miR-125 and let-7 are developmentally regulated together in flies34,35,
but in C. elegans, lin-4 and let-7 are unlinked, and are expressed
sequentially36,20. The clustered arrangement of lin-4 and let-7 in
insects and vertebrates could represent an ancestral, conserved
functional association between these two temporal regulators. A
mammalian miRNA gene-cluster of particular interest encodes the
six closely related genes for miR-290 to miR-295 in mouse32. These are
expressed specifically in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Although it is not
yet clear whether the human genome contains an orthologous cluster
of ES-cell-enriched miRNAs, these findings suggest that translational
repression of gene expression by miRNAs contributes to the maintenance of stem-cell potency32.
The properties of another cluster of miRNAs, on mouse distal chromosome 12 (and conserved at human 14q32), imply other interesting
functions for miRNAs37. This locus includes at least two miRNA genes
(miR-127 and miR-136) that are imprinted: they are expressed exclusively from the maternal chromosome. A retroviral transposon-like
gene on the complementary strand to miR-127 and miR-136 is
expressed only from the paternal chromosome. Consequently, miR-127
and miR-136 miRNAs are precisely complementary to the retroviral
transposon-like mRNA. This arrangement suggests that miR-127
and miR-136 could regulate the transposon by means of an RNAi
pathway37. Although the function of this distal 12/14q32 cluster of
miRNAs is unclear at present, the locus is of interest, if only
because many other imprinted genes are known to have roles in

of bantam 25,26 and mir-14 (ref. 27) miRNA genes. Examples of miRNAs that were

early development. Moreover, a high concentration of other hairpinforming miRNA candidates in the sequences surrounding miR-127
and miR-136 (ref. 37) suggests that many more mammalian miRNAs
are yet to be discovered.

Prediction and validation of miRNA targets
The imprecise base pairing between the typical animal miRNA and a
target mRNA suggests that any given miRNA can bind to a broad spectrum of different mRNAs, and so possess an enormous regulatory
potential38. This raises questions and concerns for systems biologists
attempting to use computational approaches to identify miRNA
target genes. Of all the predicted candidate targets of a given miRNA,
which ones are authentic targets in vivo? The development of reliable
methods for the computational prediction of animal miRNA targets
necessarily involves an iterative process of algorithm design and
refinement, guided by in vivo tests of the in silico predictions. So far,
several published papers make good progress towards this end,
although more work remains to be done.
Three groups have conducted computational screens for
Drosophila miRNA targets on a genomic39,40 or subgenomic scale41,
and two screens for vertebrate miRNA targets have been reported42,43.
All these approaches are based on the same fundamental assumption,
which is that miRNA targets in general can be modelled on the base
pairing between lin-4 and let-7 of C. elegans and their geneticallyvalidated mRNA targets19,20,22–24. The salient characteristics of this
base pairing are: (1) the location of the miRNA complementary
elements in 3 untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA targets, (2)
the concentration of base pairing in a ‘seed’ or ‘nucleus’ of continuous Watson–Crick base pairing in the 5-proximal half of the miRNA,
and (3) the phylogenetic conservation of the complementary
sequences in UTRs of orthologous genes. There is good evidence in
support of the general applicability of these assumptions. First, for all
the genetically-validated animal miRNA target genes, functional
miRNA complementary sites lie within their 3 UTR
sequences19,20,22–24,26,29,30. Second, there are several lines of evidence,

apart from the topology of the known C. elegans lin-4 and let-7 sites,
that point to the importance of base pairing in the 5 half of the
miRNA1. Of particular note are recent mutational studies using a
variety of different miRNAs that support the primacy of critical base
pairs and base-pairing patterns involving the first nine nucleotides of
the miRNA43–45. Finally, the criterion of phylogenetic conservation
was found to be particularly important for reducing what is assumed
to be the vast number of false-positive partial-complementary
elements predicted for a given miRNA39–43.
Despite the fundamentally similar approaches used for the published screens for miRNA targets, the results are not particularly congruent. This is probably because the approaches differ in certain
important details, including: (1) the particular method of defining
phylogenetic conservation, (2) the precise manner of modelling sites
based on the verified cases, and (3) how thermodynamic and statistical
factors are applied to score and rank predicted sites. As it is essentially
impossible at this early stage to know which specific target-prediction
method is more accurate, for now, it is probably wise to treat their
results as complementary data sets.
Stark et al.39 report the 100 highest-scoring targets for each of 73
known fly miRNAs, and Enright et al.40 report the top 10 most statistically significant predicted targets for each fly miRNA. Of the 730
predicted targets reported by Enright et al.40 about 15% were also
flagged by Stark et al.39 The predicted targets identified by both
groups arguably represent the most reliable predictions from a
biological standpoint. For example, both Enright et al.40 and Stark et
al.39 identified genes of the Notch cell-surface receptor pathway as
targets of miR-7. A third Drosophila miRNA target search did not
survey all fly genes for miRNA targets, but focused on a selected set of
protein genes that encode well-characterized regulators of embryonic
patterning41. From among these patterning genes, 39 predicted targets of miRNAs were identified. About 20% of these targets were
associated with the same miRNAs as those identified by Stark et al.39,
but none were among the top 10 lists from Enright et al.40.
Lewis et al.42 identified orthologous genes from human, mouse
and rat, which show conserved predicted sites for the same miRNA. A
subset of these genes were identified as predicted targets for the same
miRNA in mammals, and in the fish Fugu rubripes42.Kiriakidou et al.43
reported several hundred predicted targets for mammalian miRNAs,
and among these, two (initiation factor IF-2 targeted by miR-20 and
the protein ATAXIN targeted by mir-101) were also predicted by
Lewis et al.42 One possible reason for the lack of overlap between the
two vertebrate target screens is the difference in how the two groups
dealt with target genes that are predicted to have just a single site for a
given miRNA. Lewis et al.42 showed that the occurrence of multiple
conserved sites for a given miRNA in the same UTR was a strong predictor of that gene being a statistically significant target. In contrast,
genes with a single predicted high-scoring site could not, with confidence, be counted as potential miRNA targets. This was also the case
in the insect target searches39–41. However, Kiriakidou et al. made
progress towards reliable prediction of single-site targets43.
Structure–function studies of a model miRNA complementary site
and its cognate miRNA were conducted to derive rules for the characteristics of functional miRNA-target sites43. These rules were incorporated into a computational algorithm, and the resulting rates of
false-positive predictions (as judged by comparison to a population
of randomized miRNA sequences) were low enough to permit statistically significant single-site predictions43.
Increasing the statistical significance of single-site predictions is
important, as there is evidence that multiple sites for the same
miRNA are not necessarily required for targeting. For example, there
is a single lin-4 complementary site in the C. elegans lin-28 3 UTR24.
In fact, Kiriakidou et al. used the phylogenetically conserved let-7b site
in the 3 UTR of human lin-28 (ref. 46) as a test case for
structure–function analysis, and showed that the site can mediate
translational repression in human and mouse cultured cells43. These
sites seem to be absent from the insect lin-28(ref. 46), consistent with

evolutionary flexibility in miRNA–target-gene relationships. let-7
sites in mammalian lin-28 were not identified by Lewis et al.42, probably because the mouse and human lin-28 3 UTR contains too few
repeats of these sites.
In vivo tests of some of the insect and vertebrate miRNA target
predictions have produced promising results that tend to support the
predictions. By fusing the UTR from predicted targets to a reporter
construct, the regulatory capacity of the UTR-containing miRNA
complementary elements could be assessed in transgenic flies39–40 or
in animal cells42,43. A significant fraction of the predicted UTR targets
tested by these ‘sensor’ assays seemed to confer significant repression
on the reporter, compared with a control UTR, in approximate agreement with the estimated frequencies of false positives39,40,42,43. A problem with using these reporter tests to validate sites was that it was not
always possible to control for the specificity of the miRNA, which
would ideally involve comparing the reporter expression levels in the
presence and absence of the miRNA.
It is worth noting that even when a predicted site seems to be validated by reporter studies, that site may not normally function in vivo
(that is, if the miRNA and the mRNA are not normally co-expressed
in the same cell). So, to derive a reliable picture of the likely miRNA
pathways, it will be necessary to correlate the expression profiles of
miRNAs with those of their potential target genes.
How might the current methods for computational prediction of
miRNA targets be improved? Further in vivo analysis of predicted
miRNA–target structures should lead to more refined rules of functional engagement, such as those derived by Kiriakidou et al.43. If the
short interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfection method43,45 is to become
a method of choice for these studies, it is important to ensure that a
miRNA introduced exogenously faithfully engages the normal
endogenous miRNA-mediated translational repression8,9. So far, the
target prediction algorithms do not take into account the potential
structure of the UTR sequences at or surrounding potential complementary sites. Using transgenic worms, Vella et al.44 tested modified
versions of the C. elegans lin-41 3 UTR, which is targeted by let-7, and
found that sequences surrounding the miRNA sites are important for
efficient let-7-mediated repression of lin-41 translation. This finding
reinforces the potential importance of incorporating into target prediction algorithms parameters that capture salient structural characteristics of the 3 UTR.
In future searches for animal miRNA targets, 5 UTR sequences
should be included along with 3 UTRs , if only to critically test
current assumptions about the primacy of 3 UTRs. Likewise,
because plant miRNAs can recognize complementary elements within
a coding sequence, future animal target searches should probably
address this possibility directly. As discussed above, the assumption
that miRNA–target binding is dominated by contiguous
Watson–Crick base-pairing involving the 5-proximal miRNA
nucleotides seems to be reasonably well justified on theoretical and
experimental grounds. However, there are likely to be important
exceptions. For example, a site with nearly perfect complementarity
to miR-196a is conserved in the 3 UTR of the HOXB8 gene of mammals, fish and frog47. But the site contains a conserved G•U base pair
that breaks the 5 Watson–Crick ‘seed’ helix. Remarkably, the G•U
base pair is the only imperfection in the miR-196a::HOXB8 match,
and it seems that this essentially continuous helix triggers cleavage of
HOXB8 mRNA in vivo, instead of translational repression47. This
result shows that in animals, as in plants, a miRNA–target match of
near-perfect complementarity, even one containing G•U base-pairs
in the miRNA 5 proximal block, can cause mRNA destruction.
The evolution of computational algorithms for animal miRNA
target prediction will eventually lead to a scheme that is supported by
experimental validation, that produces low rates of false-positive and
false-negative predictions, and that reliably identifies functional single sites. Accurate rules for functional miRNA–target structures
should permit the use of methods that are less dependent on conservation of the miRNA across wide phylogenetic distances. This is

important for miRNAs such as those of the mouse ES-cell cluster, for
which well-conserved human orthologues are not apparent. Some
important miRNAs and/or miRNA targets may be less well conserved
phylogenetically, and could be best identified by comparison of more
closely related genomes, such as human and other primates.

The genetic analysis of miRNA genes in model organisms is beginning
to put into place the pieces of a mosaic that will eventually show us the
range of functions that miRNAs have in the control of animal development and physiology. The computational prediction of miRNA–target
interactions must work in parallel with genetics to identify miRNAregulated pathways. These computational predictions will probably
steadily improve in accuracy, as the existing algorithms are refined
through an iterative process of in silico prediction and in vivo experimentation. Many outstanding questions about miRNAs remain.
What affects the accessibility and efficacy of a miRNA at a UTR? What
dictates whether an animal miRNA represses translation or directs
mRNA cleavage? What is the nature and significance of functional
cooperation and redundancy among miRNA genes? To what extent
do distinct miRNAs act in combination on the same targets? The
analysis of functional redundancy or epistatic relationships among
miRNAs should be aided by the development of both genetic and
nongenetic methods for the inhibition of particular miRNAs (singly
or in combination). For example, recent publication of methods for
the inhibition of miRNAs in vivo using complementary oligonucleotides50,51 should encourage the application of gene ‘knockdown’ approaches for the efficient analysis of miRNA function in
cultured cells or intact animals.
The genetic analysis of miRNA function is an exciting challenge:
the ‘miRNA milieu’ in a metazoan cell is likely to hold enormous
potential for subtle and complex genetic regulatory interactions
involving dozens of miRNAs and their numerous targets38. Classical
forward genetics continues to demonstrate its power in the miRNA
arena, but much of what miRNAs accomplish may be both complex
and subtle, demanding the creative application of genomics and
reverse genetic approaches.

The biological repertoire of miRNAs
What can be gleaned from the first set of miRNA/target searches
regarding miRNA biology? Very few of the predicted vertebrate
miRNA target genes were predicted to be targets for the orthologous
miRNAs in insects. This suggests that although the sequence of a
miRNA (and hence the sequence of its complementary sites) can be
conserved across wide phylogenetic distances, the particular target
genes (in which the binding sites reside) may be evolutionarily flexible.
If binding sites (or blocks of UTR sequences containing the sites) can
transpose between genes during evolution, then the biological
pathways controlled by particular miRNAs would be evolutionarily
plastic.
Are there any apparent trends in the types of gene that seem to be
regulated by miRNAs? In C. elegans, the heterochronic genes targeted
by lin-4 or let-7 encode nuclear proteins (LIN-14, HBL-1)19,48,49 and
apparent RNA binding proteins (LIN-28, LIN-41)23,24,44. lsy-6 and
mir-273 regulate transcription factors29,30. Similarly, the lists of predicted insect miRNA targets seem to be enriched in genes encoding
transcription factors39–41, but also include genes with diverse functions that are not directly related to gene expression. For example, the
predicted targets of miR-277 in Drosophila include a striking enrichment of genes in the biochemical pathway for the catabolism of
leucine, isoleucine and valine44. This result strongly suggests that
miR-277 could regulate this biochemical pathway at several points.
The control of cell fate is clearly a common theme for the activity
of miRNAs1. The heterochronic regulators lin-4 and let-7, and the
cell-death regulator bantam, control cell-fate choices for diverse cell
types — ‘early’ versus ‘late’ in the case of the lin-4/let-7 pathway, and
proliferation versus death for the bantam pathway. miR-181, lsy-6
and mir-273 control more specific cell-fate choices for specific cell
types. Similarly, miR-181 may have distinct activities in the B-cell and
T-cell lineages of mouse haematopoiesis, although the targets in
these cells are not obvious from the published target searches.
