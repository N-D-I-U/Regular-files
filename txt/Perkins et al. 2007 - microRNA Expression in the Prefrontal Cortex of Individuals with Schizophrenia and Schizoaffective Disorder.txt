Abstract

interactions

Results: We hypothesized that schizophrenia might be associated with altered miRNA profiles.
To investigate this possibility we compared the expression of 264 human miRNAs from
postmortem prefrontal cortex tissue of individuals with schizophrenia (n = 13) or schizoaffective
disorder (n = 2) to tissue of 21 psychiatrically unaffected individuals using a custom miRNA
microarray. Allowing a 5% false discovery rate, we found that 16 miRNAs were differentially
expressed in prefrontal cortex of patient subjects, with 15 expressed at lower levels (fold change
0.63 to 0.89) and 1 at a higher level (fold change 1.77) than in the psychiatrically unaffected
comparison subjects. The expression levels of 12 selected miRNAs were also determined by
quantitative RT-PCR in our lab. For the eight miRNAs distinguished by being expressed at lower
microarray levels in schizophrenia samples versus comparison samples, seven were also expressed
at lower levels with quantitative RT-PCR.

Background: microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNA molecules that are now thought
to regulate the expression of many mRNAs. They have been implicated in the etiology of a variety
of complex diseases, including Tourette's syndrome, Fragile × syndrome, and several types of
cancer.

Conclusion: This study is the first to find altered miRNA profiles in postmortem prefrontal cortex
from schizophrenia patients.

Schizophrenia is a common neuropsychiatric disorder affecting one percent of the general population. The personal,

familial, and societal costs of the disease are enormous, with
chronic symptoms that result in marked functional disability.

In fact, approximately three percent of all person-years lived
with disability are due to schizophrenia [1].

Given the critical role that miRNAs might play in regulating
brain development early in life and mediating synaptic plasticity later in life, we have hypothesized that the etiopathology
of schizophrenia might be associated with altered expression
or function of miRNAs [27]; the association might be causative or part of compensatory reactions to some other causative agents. As a first step we compared the expression of
human miRNAs from postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) of
individuals with schizophrenia to that of unaffected
individuals.

It is clear that schizophrenia has a strong genetic component,
although its genetic basis remains unknown [2]. Consistent
with a disease mechanism that involves post-transcriptional
dysregulation of gene expression, postmortem studies find
altered levels of mRNA and proteins rather than a specific
abnormal protein [3]. Postmortem studies also find differences between schizophrenia and unaffected comparison
subjects in the relationship of such mRNAs and cognate proteins [4,5].
microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs
(ncRNAs) that in animals regulate gene expression by inhibiting mRNA translation. Each miRNA is initially processed
from a large (approximately 200 nucleotide (nt) to several
thousand nt) RNA transcript, the 'primary miRNA' (primiRNA) to a smaller (approximately 58-137 nt) hairpin precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) by a protein complex, the
'microprocessor', and then by DICER1 (alias Dicer) to the
mature miRNA [6]. The mature miRNA joins with the RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC), and then binds the RISC
to a partially complementary target region in an mRNA to
accelerate mRNA degradation or inhibit translation. Some
474 RNA hairpins (pre-miRNAs) are known to be transcribed
in humans, yielding 471 distinct, mature miRNAs, and there
are in addition over 800 predicted human miRNAs. The associated control systems might regulate expression of thousands of human genes [7-9]. In particular, seminal
experiments have shown that miRNAs regulate a variety of
key biological functions, including cell proliferation and differentiation [10-15], insulin secretion [16], and apoptosis
[17]. Emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs also regulate
brain development [18,19], dendritic spine morphology [20],
and neurite outgrowth [21], that is, certain processes that are
hypothesized to be associated with schizophrenia
neuropathology.
In addition to critical regulatory roles in development and
cellular functions, miRNAs have now been implicated in several human diseases [22]. For example, the etiology of some
cases of Tourette's syndrome, a disorder characterized by
vocal and motor tics, has been shown to be related to either
the absence of or a mutation in the miR-189 target site in the
3' untranslated region (UTR) of gene SLITRK1 [23]. Fragile X
syndrome, one of the most common genetic disorders affecting brain function, is characterized by deficits that range from
learning disabilities in individuals with normal intelligence to
severe intellectual deficits and behavioral disturbances. The
genetic basis is most commonly a CGG repeat expansion in
the 5' UTR of FMRP causing transcriptional silencing [24].
FMRP might regulate the translation of mRNAs through
association with RISCs and miRNAs, and, in particular, might
regulate translation of mRNAs locally in the dendrites [2426].

Results
General description of prefrontal cortical miRNA
expression
From the 265 distinct, human miRNAs included on our array,
244 were detected (1.5-fold over background) in the PFC tissue of ≥60% of the study subjects. These included robust
detection of miRNAs previously known to be expressed in the
brain (for example, let-7a to let-7i) as well as brain-specific
miRNAs (for example, miR-124a and miR-125b) (Additional
data file 1) [11,28].

miRNA expression in schizophrenia versus unaffected
comparison subjects
Assuming a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, 16 miRNAs were
differentially expressed in PFC of schizophrenia subjects (n =
13) or schizoaffective disorder (n = 2) versus PFC of 21 psychiatrically unaffected individuals (Table 1). Of the 16 distinguished miRNAs, 15 were expressed at lower (fold change
0.63 to 0.89) and one at higher (fold change 1.77) levels than
in the psychiatrically unaffected comparison subjects. A heat
map based on cluster analysis illustrates the differentiated
expression levels of these probes (Figure 1). Controlling on
brain pH, postmortem interval (PMI), and hemisphere, and
excluding the two subjects with schizoaffective disorder from
the analyses did not substantially affect these results (Additional data file 2).

Quantitative RT-PCR verification of microarray results
The expression levels of 12 selected miRNAs were also determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in our lab (Additional data file 3). For the eight miRNAs distinguished by
being expressed at lower microarray levels in schizophrenia
samples versus comparison samples, seven were also
expressed at lower levels with qRT-PCR (Figure 2). For four
of the seven, the difference in expression was significant with
p < 0.05, consistent with microarray findings for the same
miRNAs. The eighth miRNA, miR-7, was found by qRT-PCR
to have higher levels in schizophrenia than comparison subjects, but the difference in expression was not significantly
different between groups (p = 0.23); we have not determined
a cause for this one discrepancy of PCR versus microarray
results. We also compared expression of four miRNAs that
were not differentially expressed in the microarray results,

miRNA and Affymetrix U133A probe relationships
We considered whether the observed pattern of lower expression of some miRNAs in schizophrenia subjects was related to
lower pri-miRNA transcription. We adopted the previously
published method of Thomson and colleagues [29], where the
pri-miRNA expression was determined from existing
archived mRNA microarray results from the PFC of the same
study subjects. A total of 52 of the miRNAs included in this
study could be mapped to a primary transcript that was
present among the mRNA transcripts accessible with the
Affymetrix U133A array. All but three of the miRNAs with
corresponding U133A probes were from the introns of protein-coding genes (host genes). The mean expression of only
two of the Affymetrix U133A probes was significantly different between groups (ELM2 hosting miR-330 with p = 0.03;
MYH6 hosting miR-208 with p = 0.03). However, these dif-

We then focused on the five miRNAs expressed at significantly lower levels in schizophrenia that also had a U133A
probe that included the pri-miRNA transcript (miR-26b,
miR-9-3p (alias miR-9*), miR-24, miR-7, and miR-30e). The
ratio of mature miRNA to primary miRNA transcripts was
lower for schizophrenia versus controls for all 5 miRNAs, and
the difference in ratios reached statistical significance for 3 of
the 5 (miR-26b, p = 0.009; miR-9-3p, p = 0.002; and miR24, p = 0.037). For the one miRNA that was expressed at a
significantly higher level in schizophrenia subjects, miR106b, the ratio was also significantly higher (p = 0.003 and p
= 0.006 for the two associated Affymetrix pri-miRNA
probes). In the remaining 46 miRNAs with a corresponding
Affymetrix U133A probe for their pri-miRNA transcripts, the
ratio of miRNA to host mRNA was significantly lower for two
pri-miRNAs (primary transcripts for miR-218, p = 0.021, and
miR-9, p = 0.006) and significantly higher for five (miR-482,
p = 0.015; miR-190, p = 0.018; miR-105, p = 0.02; miR-148b,
p = 0.027; miR-218, p = 0.02). Thus, we found that the
miRNA:U133A probe ratios of the schizophrenia group were
significantly different from those of the comparison group for
4 of the 6 differentiated miRNAs but only 7 of the 46 nondifferentiated miRNAs (p = 0.013, Fisher's exact test) (Additional data file 5).

Since all of the schizophrenia subjects were treated or had
previously been treated with antipsychotics and none of the
psychiatrically unaffected subjects were reported to have
such a treatment history, we endeavored to evaluate the effect
of antipsychotic treatment on miRNA expression. We compared expression of 179 rat miRNAs in haloperidol-treated
and -untreated rats. With a FDR of 5% we found that three
miRNAs were expressed at higher levels in the haloperidoltreated rats: miR-199a, miR-128a, and miR-128b. None of
these miRNAs was differentially expressed in the PFC of
schizophrenia patients (Additional data file 4).

pri-miRNA and upstream of the single-stranded RNA
(ssRNA)-double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) junction that would
lend selectivity to this process. Specifically, we hypothesized
that an upstream motif of some kind is shared by the 15 miRNAs that were found to be downregulated in our tests of schizophrenia PFC samples. To seek bioinformatic indications, we
focused on source pre-miRNAs that were isolated (no other
pre-miRNAs within 1,000 bases), yielding 11 distinguished,
isolated pre-miRNAs: miR-7-1, miR-7-2, miR-7-3, miR-9-1,
miR-9-2, miR-9-3, miR-26b, miR-30a, miR-30b, miR-30d,
miR-30e. Of these, miR-9-1 and miR-30a can yield two
mature miRNAs; the others yield one. Furthermore, miR-7-2,
miR-9-2, miR-9-3, miR-30b, and miR-30d are intergenic,
and the others are intronic in coding genes.
Using a combination of approaches, we found the motif
UGAGNCUU upstream of pre-miRNA sequences for miR26b, miR-30a, miR-30b, and miR-7-1. We also found GUCNCUUC upstream of pre-miRNAs miR-9-1, miR-9-2, miR-9-3,
miR-7-3, and miR-30e. Thus, both 8 nt motifs are found
upstream of 9 of the 11 isolated, distinguished pre-miRNAs.

Lastly, instances of UGUUNNAAGAUG were found upstream
of pre-miRNAs for miR-30d and miR-7-2 at the same distance, 108 bases, and not within 500 bases upstream of any
other human, isolated pre-miRNAs. For displays of the motifs
and the bases between motifs and junctions, see Additional
data file 6; clustering of the number of bases in each such
interval is displayed in Figure 3. Bioinformatic searches by us
have found neither shared motifs that are positioned at similarly clustered distances from the junctions nor strong general homology among the 11 upstream regions.
Importantly, the same 8 nt motifs UGAGNCUU and GUCNCUUC are absent from the 500-base 5' regions of most undistinguished pre-miRNAs. That is, the same motifs are also
upstream of only 13 isolated, undistinguished pre-miRNAs
among a total of 192 isolated, human pre-miRNAs, and some
of the 13 are sequentially similar as mature miRNAs to the 11
distinguished ones. However, carefully designed and executed in vivo experiments would be needed to determine
whether the above or any other motifs are actually functional;
the above motifs are intriguing, but their bioinformatic

coordinated pre-miRNA excision.

Discussion

miRNAs, with their key roles in regulating both synaptic plasticity and brain development, are candidate genetic contributors to the etiopathology of schizophrenia. miRNA expression
for 16 miRNAs was significantly different in the PFC of schizophrenia versus comparison subjects, with all but one of the
differentiated miRNAs decreased in the schizophrenia subjects. To our knowledge this study is the first to associate
altered expression of miRNAs with schizophrenia. Possibly
the association is etiologic, but it could also be part of a complex response to other factors.

A hypothesized role for altered miRNA biogenesis
Our follow-up analyses were designed to generate hypotheses
about possible mechanisms that could explain the downregulation of miRNAs reported in this study. For miRNAs hosted
in introns of coding genes, we found that the ratios of microarray expression levels of miRNA versus mRNA (of host gene)
were significantly different for miRNA distinguished by
schizophrenia. That is, 4 of the 6 hosted, distinguished miRNAs exhibited the difference, but only 7 of the 46 undistinguished miRNAs did so. This suggests a role for altered
biogenesis of miRNAs rather than altered transcription of primiRNAs. In addition, our bioinformatic investigations found
2 common motifs located at approximately 100 or
approximately 400 bases from the pri-miRNA:pre-miRNA

junction in 9 of the 11 isolated, distinguished miRNAs; but the
same motifs are absent in almost all of the undistinguished
miRNAs. We speculate (see Figure 4) that these motifs might
represent binding sites for factors like heteronuclear ribonuclear proteins (hnRNPs) [30], known to chaperone other
RNA events.
The bioinformatic similarities involving motifs, though not
yet investigated in vivo, are consistent with the hypothesis
that the coordinated downregulation of 15 miRNAs reported
in this study might be related to alternative processing during
the pre-miRNA biogenesis process, rather than altered primiRNA transcription. There is evidence that, in some cases,
miRNA biogenesis regulates mature miRNA levels. Thomson
et al. [29] found that in mice, levels of mature miRNAs hsalet-7g and hsa-let-7f-2/miR-98 increased over 4,000-fold in
day 14.5 embryos from levels in embryonic stem cells. However, over the same developmental period the primary transcript pri-miRNA expression levels did not change, and premiRNA levels were essentially undetectable. Also, the same
Thomson analysis indicates that the widespread downregulation of miRNAs observed in cancer [31,32] might be due to a
failure in miRNA processing that is post-transcriptional
(transcription of pri-miRNA). Discovery of parallel mechanisms of regulation of other sets of miRNAs, such as the 15
downregulated miRNAs in schizophrenia, would, therefore,
be of considerable interest.
Further study is required to test the hypothesis that altered
regulation of miRNA biogenesis might be involved in the

information

Although the functions of most human miRNAs have yet to be
discovered, miRNAs have emerged as key regulators of gene
expression. The findings of this study implicate a role for
miRNAs in schizophrenia, and lead us to the hypothesis that
there is altered processing of miRNAs during the miRNA biogenesis process in schizophrenia. This hypothesis is analogous to that for altered miRNA transcription in cancer by
Thomson et al. [29].

interactions

Dysregulation of miRNA levels would be anticipated to affect
the translation of multiple protein coding genes. Bioinformatic strategies are now developed to identify potential
miRNA target sites in the 3' UTR of a protein coding gene, for
example the program miRanda [7]. The potential targets of
miRNAs often include hundreds of genes because the reverse
complement of some 'seeds' (bases 2 through 8 of the mature
miRNA) appears in multiple locations in many pre-mRNA 3'
UTRs. However, only a few of these potential target sites have
been verified as potent in vivo [37]. With the understanding
that identification of mRNA targets is speculative, we
explored whether there might be common mRNA targets for
the 15 distinguished, downregulated miRNAs and whether
these targeted genes are over-represented in any Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
through the KEGG website [38].

As a final note, DiGeorge critical region 8 (DGCR8), involved
in miRNA biogenesis as a component of the microprocessor,
is located in a genomic region of chromosome 22q11 where
microdeletions have been associated with a 30-fold increased
risk of schizophrenia [33,34]. Microdeletions in 22q11 occur
in approximately 1 in 3,000 live births but are present in 0.5%
to 3% of individuals with schizophrenia [35,36]. Possibly,
DGCR8 polymorphisms that alter expression or function
through haploinsufficiency or other genetic variants might
also contribute to the etiopathology of schizophrenia by
impacting miRNA biogenesis and regulation of gene
expression.

The differentially expressed miRNAs are currently annotated
in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Computational Biology Center web site. These 15 miRNAs are identified using miRanda to potentially target the 3' UTRs of over
4,600 genes, with 1,539 targeted by 2 or more of them [39].
Using the programs offered by the Database for Annotation,
Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to identify
over-represented pathways, we found that the genes that
were commonly targeted by the miRNAs were significantly
clustered in 12 KEGG pathways (Table 2) [40]. It is of interest
that the most significantly differentiated pathways are
involved in synaptic plasticity at the level of dendritic spines.
For example, the MAPK and phosphatidylinositol signaling
pathways are involved in the regulation of dendritic spine
morphogenesis, size, and shape [41,42] and act through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton [43]. In addition, the focal
adhesion pathways mediated through extracellular matrix
receptor interactions have also been shown to control dendritic spine plasticity [44]. Translation of mRNA into proteins
that are important to synaptic plasticity can occur locally in
dendrites [45]. Thus, the miRNAs differentiated in this study
might be involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, and
in that manner associated with characteristics of synaptic
plasticity in schizophrenia.

Materials and methods
Postmortem tissue
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Postmortem human brain tissue was obtained from the Harvard
Brain Tissue Resource Center [46]. Tissue consisted of frozen
blocks (300-500 mg/block) from the PFC (Brodmann area
nine from 15 individuals with schizophrenia and 21 unaffected comparison subjects (Table 3)). The tissue was groupmatched for age, gender, PMI, and hemisphere. Postmortem

neuropathological examinations were performed by an experienced neuropathologist, and all subjects included in the
collection were free of neurodegenerative pathology.
Postmortem neurotoxicological studies showed no evidence
of illicit substance use at the time of death.

Animals
Experimental protocols were approved by the UNC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Singly housed, male
Sprague-Dawley rats (150-200 g; Charles River, Raleigh, NC,

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R27

USA) received daily intraperitoneal injections of haloperidol
1 mg/kg/d (n = 6) or saline 0.9% (n = 6) for 4 weeks. One hour
after the final dose, rats were briefly anesthetized with ether
and sacrificed; their brains were removed and hemisected.
Right anterior medial frontal cortex was dissected out and
frozen on dry ice. All tissue was kept frozen at -80°C until use.

mRNA microarray analysis procedures

Total RNA (5 μg) was DNase I (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) treated according to the manufacturer's instructions, phenol:chloroform extracted, ethanol precipitated, and
dissolved in DEPC-treated dH2O (DEPC; diethylpyrocarbonate). RNA (5 μg) was polyadenylated using Poly(A)
polymerase (Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions, phenol:chloroform extracted,
ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in DEPC-treated dH2O. A
modified cDNA was made as follows: 5 μg of polyadenylated
RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) with 2.5
μg of random hexamers and 500 ng of oligo(dT) adapter
primer (5'-GCGAGCACAGAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTTTTTTTTTTTTVN-3') according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The reaction was terminated by incubation at
70°C for 10 minutes and diluted into 2 ml of dH2O (5 ng/μl).
Quantitative PCR was used to measure the mature miRNA
transcript as follows: 5 μl of cDNA was mixed with 5 pmol of
both the forward and reverse primers in a final volume of 12.5
μl and mixed with 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green PCR master mix
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA). Primer
sequences are in Additional data file 7. All reactions were run
in triplicate on a DNA Engine Opticon 2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA). The amplification protocol
for mature miRNA PCR was performed according to the highstringency protocol of Shi and Chiang [57] except the reverse
primer Mir-qPCR-3-3' (5'-GCAGCA CAGAATTAATACGACTCAC-3') was used in conjunction with an exact sequence-specific primer to each miRNA. Mature miRNA expression used
the reference gene U6 snRNA (U6-F, 5'-CGCTTC GGCAGCACATATAC-3'; U6-R, 5'-TTCACGAATTTGCGTGTCAT-3').
The expression was determined for eight subjects, four with
schizophrenia and four healthy subjects (Additional data file
3). Expression was calculated using the delta-delta C(t)
method: 2ΔCT healthy-ΔCT schizophrenia with ΔCT = (CT miRNA - CT
reference RNA U6) [58].

deposited research

Microarray data analysis began with data extraction from the
GPR files. Data points were eliminated if foreground was not
1.5 times local background and a probe was removed if >40%
of the data points were missing. A total of 239 miRNA
remained after this pre-processing. Data were background
subtracted, log-transformed, and missing values were
imputed using k-NN [50]. For comparisons across samples,
data were normalized using rank invariant normalization
[51]. The per-sample mean of the two rank invariant normalized probes was used for analyses. Univariate calculations of
differential expression were estimated using Statistical Analysis of Microarrays (SAM; two-class, unpaired test; 500 permutations; FDR of 5%) [52]. All analysis procedures were
done using R [53]. Cluster analysis was done with
GeneCluster© [54] and displayed using TreeView© [55] (Figure 1).

qRT-PCR procedures

reports

Oligonucleotide probes were synthesized in duplicate for 264
human miRNAs antisense to the mature sequence reported in
the Sanger miRNA registry [48]. Probes were spotted in
duplicate on Corning (Corning, New York, USA) GAPS-2
coated slides using a robotic spotter and cross-linked by UV.
Hybridization and washing were performed as described. All
arrays were from the same batch, and the microarrays were
run on the same day by the same two persons. Our prior
research indicates that our in-house miRNA microarrays
have excellent reliability and validity [49].

reviews

miRNA microarray expression analysis was performed as
previously described [47]. Tissue disruption by Dounce
homogenization was followed by total RNA isolation with
TRIZOL™ reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA).
RNA (5 μg) was labeled with T4-RNA ligase and precipitated
with 0.3 M sodium acetate, 2 volumes ethanol, and re-suspended in water.
