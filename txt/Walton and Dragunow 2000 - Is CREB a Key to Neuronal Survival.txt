Is CREB a key to neuronal survival?
Marshall R. Walton and Mike Dragunow
A range of molecules control nerve-cell survival in the brain. Many of these molecules might be
neuroprotective through activation of the transcription factor cAMP-response-element-binding
protein (CREB). Activation of CREB, by phosphorylation of Ser133, occurs in brain-damageresistant hippocampal dentate granule cells and is triggered by neuroprotective environmental
stimulation. In addition, the Akt neuroprotective signaling pathway activates CREB, and CREB
synthesis and phosphorylation promote the survival of many cells, including neurons, in vitro.Thus,
CREB might be responsible for programmed nerve-cell survival. Studies investigating its role in
the brain are now required to confirm these in vitro results, and the downstream survival genes,
whose expression is activated by CREB in neurons, need to be identified.

ELECTIVE NEURONAL VULNERABILITY is a feature
of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, but the
processes that target specific neurons for death while
allowing others to remain healthy are unclear. The differential activation of an internal death program in
vulnerable neurons has been proposed as a mechanism
to explain the selective death of neurons1. However, it is
equally likely that specific neuronal populations contain an intrinsic survival mechanism. The presence or
activity, or both, of such a pathway in different cell types
could partly explain their varying sensitivities to detrimental brain insults. Research in this cell-survival area
has focused on identifying the key mediators in this
survival cascade and has concentrated on endogenous
neuroprotective messengers, such as neurotrophic factors and various cytokines2. Recently, several studies
implicated the transcription factor, cAMP-responseelement-binding protein (CREB), not only in the signaling pathway activated by these molecules, but also
as a possible regulator of a general survival program in
neurons.

CREB is a member of a large family of structurally
related transcription factors, including activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1), ATF2 (also know as CREBP1),
ATF3 and ATF4, which bind to cAMP-response-element
(CRE) promoter sites on target genes. The CREB protein
can exist in three alternatively spliced isoforms, a, b and
D, which have different properties and developmental
regulation. CREB has been implicated in the transcriptional control of numerous genes, many of which are
rapidly expressed in response to an elevation of cytoplasmic cAMP or Ca21 levels. In common with the inducible transcription factors Fos and Jun, the CREB/ATF
proteins consist of three functional domains: a leucinezipper domain that mediates dimerization, a basic
DNA-binding domain and the transcriptional activation
domain, which contains important phosphorylation
sites.
The transcriptional activation of CREB is crucially
dependent on phosphorylation of Ser133 by protein
kinase A (PKA)3, Ca21-activated calmodulin kinases, ribosomal S6 kinase 2, or mitogen-activated protein-kinaseactivated protein kinase 2 (Ref. 4). The mechanism by
TINS Vol. 23, No. 2, 2000

which Ser133 phosphorylation activates CREB remains
unclear; however, it has been suggested that this modification induces a conformational change that transforms CREB from an inactive to an active configuration5,6. Alternatively, phosphorylated CREB (pCREB)
might enhance transcription via the recruitment of coactivators such as CREB-binding protein (CBP)7,8. This
idea is supported by the finding that microinjection of
CBP antibodies inhibits cAMP-stimulated transcriptional
responses9. Interestingly, in its non-phosphorylated
form, CREB can suppress activator protein 1 (AP1) activity by competing with JUN protein for the AP1 site on
target genes. As pCREB lacks this ability, its activation
might act as a regulatory mechanism to facilitate
transcriptional activation of immediate–early genes10,11.

Selective vulnerability in the hippocampus
In its active form, CREB has been shown to regulate
many aspects of neuronal functioning, including neuronal excitation12, development13 and long-term synaptic plasticity14. Recent evidence suggests that CREB might
also be involved in an active process of neuroprotection,
which therefore explains the selective vulnerability of
the hippocampus to brain injury. The hippocampal subregions show a distinct pattern of cell death in response
to a number of insults, in particular after prolonged
seizures and hypoxic–ischemic (HI) episodes1,15. The CA1
pyramidal cells undergo apoptosis after these types of
insult, whereas the dentate granule cells remain resistant
to damage15,16 (Fig. 1). A number of years ago it was
speculated that this selective vulnerability was due to
differential activation of cell-death (in CA1) and cellsurvival (in granule cells) programs. In order to identify
these programs, the expression of genes for various
transcription factors (Fos, Jun, Egr) were examined after
a HI insult15,17. The CA1 neurons that undergo apoptosis
showed a delayed and prolonged expression of Jun, Fos
and Nur77 combined with a loss of EGR1. Although
the resistant dentate granule cells also expressed Jun,
as well as Fos, Jund, Junb, Fosb, Nur77 and Egr1, the
induction was rapid in onset and more transient. On
the basis of these results, the now widely accepted
hypothesis, that JUN is involved in neuronal death18
(Fig. 1), was formulated. However, the expression of
the genes encoding transcription factors alone does

not differentiate between sensitive (CA1) and resistant
(dentate granule cells) neurons (although their kinetics
of induction are vastly different in the two cell populations, which is likely to have functional consequences).
This clearly demonstrates that other factors must be
involved in neuronal death, one of which might be
CREB activation.
After HI, there is a delayed increase in the phosphorylation of CREB within apoptosis-resistant neurons of
the dentate granule-cell layer and neocortex, whereas
a dramatic loss of CREB (phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) is found in the dying CA1 pyramidal
cells19 (Fig. 2). The prolonged increase in CREB phosphorylation within the dentate granule cells and its loss
in the CA1 neurons, which precedes the onset of cell
death, are both consistent with the hypothesis that activated CREB is important for survival of hippocampal
neurons. Furthermore, this differential distribution of
CREB protein and its phosphorylation is not confined
to this model system; it has been both replicated and
demonstrated in another global ischemic paradigm
that displays a comparable pattern of cell death20, and
after a focal ischemic insult that is characterized by widespread neuronal death leading to infarct formation21.
In the focal-ischemia model, the peri-infarct area shows
marked levels of pCREB, while the infarcted core reveals a significant reduction in the number of CREB
immunoreactive cells21.
However, this association does not extend to all
members of the CREB/ATF family, as demonstrated by
the fact that ischemia-induced ATF2 phosphorylation

(at Thr69 and Thr71) is found in the CA1 pyramidal
cells undergoing apoptosis but not in the dentate granule cells20,22. Interestingly, the peak in ATF2 phosphorylation within the CA1 (48 h post-insult) precedes the
appearance of any apoptotic markers and shows a strong
temporal relationship with JUN protein synthesis22.
Phosphorylated ATF2 and JUN share a common expression profile and also act as Jun kinase (JNK) substrates,
suggesting that an interaction between these proteins
might be important for neuronal apoptosis. Thus, the
working hypothesis to account for the selective vulnerability of hippocampal neuronal populations is that
dual JUN and ATF2 activation in CA1 neurons leads to
their demise, whereas selective CREB phosphorylation
in the dentate granule cells activates a survival program
(Table 1).

CREB activation and cell survival
The persistent phosphorylation of CREB in response
to stressful stimuli is not restricted to the in vivo situation, and has been demonstrated in PC12 cells following hypoxia4 and okadaic-acid treatment23. Although, in
both cases, increased levels of pCREB are likely to underlie numerous adaptive changes, many of which will be
unrelated to cell viability, the delayed timecourse is consistent with the idea that at least part of this induction
is involved in a cell-survival mechanism. In support of

this hypothesis, PC12 cells that overexpress the gene
for CREB have a decreased susceptibility to okadaic-acidinduced apoptosis, and a significant proportion of this
effect is dependent on prolonged phosphorylation of
CREB at Ser133 (Ref. 24). The ability of CREB to promote
cell survival has also been clearly demonstrated in other
cell systems. The transfection of human melanoma cells
with an expression vector containing a dominantnegative CREB that is mutated within its DNA-binding
domain, decreased the resistance of these cells towards
UV-radiation-induced25 and thapsigargin-induced apoptosis26. Transgenic mice that synthesize this dominantnegative form of CREB have thymocytes and T cells with
a profound proliferative defect, and show increased
sensitivity to apoptosis27. Moreover, suppressed production of CREB has been associated with influenza-Avirus-induced apoptosis of human monocytes28.
The anti-apoptotic effects of CREB might also extend
to the neuroprotection conveyed by environmental
enrichment. Recently, it was shown that rats exposed
to an enriched environment had reduced spontaneous
apoptotic cell death in the hippocampus and were
protected against kainate-induced seizures and excitotoxic injury29. Some of the resistant cell populations in
the hippocampus showed increased CREB phosphorylation, which might account for their increased resistance to damage after environmental stimulation29. An
interaction between CREB activation (Fig. 2) and the
polysialylated form of the neural cell-adhesion molecule
(PSA–NCAM) in this system is another possibility, as
double immunolabeling showed their co-localization in
the apoptotic-resistant precursor cells that align along
the hilar–granule-cell border29. PSA–NCAM is a cell-tocell adhesion molecule that is associated with dentate
granule-cell neurogenesis, precursor differentiation and
migration30. In addition, this glycoprotein might activate
cell-survival pathways by stimulating CREB phosphorylation in neurons through the RAS–mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway31. Indeed, disruption of
the NCAM receptor by crosslinking induces programmed
cell death in neurons32.
50

TINS Vol. 23, No. 2, 2000

While there is growing evidence to support the link
between the activation of CREB and programmed cell
survival, the identity of the upstream initiators of this
signaling pathway in the resistant neurons remains
unclear. The endogenous neuroprotective agent, brain
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a potential candidate in this respect, as it is co-localized with phosphorylated CREB in the dentate granule cells following hypoxic
ischemia17 (Fig. 2). This observation supports the idea
that CREB is an important regulator of neurotrophininduced gene expression33,34. The exposure of neurons
to BDNF, stimulates CREB phosphorylation and activation via at least two kinase-regulated pathways34. In
addition, CREB is able to regulate the transcription of
the Bdnf gene directly35,36, suggesting that a positivefeedback loop might be operating in some cell populations that are resistant to brain injury. Although such
a system could function independently, interaction with
other survival factors is a distinct possibility. In fact,
estrogens might exert their neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on hippocampal neurons via this
mechanism37,38. Furthermore, estrogen has been shown
to control transcription through the cAMP–PKA–CREB
signal-transduction cascade39, and can also induce the
production of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus40.
Pituitary adenylate-cyclase-activating polypeptide
(PACAP) is another survival factor that might mediate
its effects through the phosphorylation of CREB. PACAP
or, more specifically, PACAP type-I-receptor activation
promotes neuronal survival in a number of model
systems through a pathway that involves cAMP, PKA
and MAPK (Refs 41–44), all of which activate CREB.
Interestingly, the levels of this receptor are related to the
selective vulnerability of hippocampal neurons, with
the dentate granule cells showing very high amounts
of this protein, whereas in the CA1 pyramidal cells it
is almost undetectable45.
In numerous cell types, the protection against apoptosis provided by growth factors, such as insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF1) and neurotrophins, is thought to
involve the signaling pathway from phophoinositide 39
kinase (PI39 kinase) to the Ser/Thr protein kinase, Akt
(also known as protein kinase B)46–48. Although it is unclear exactly how this pathway blocks cellular apoptosis,
at least part of this effect might be accounted for by
the Akt-mediated phosphorylation of the BCL2 family
member, BAD (Refs 49,50) and the protease, caspase 9
(Ref. 51), events that are known to suppress their proapoptotic function. However, Akt can also promote cell
survival by stimulating the expression of cellular genes
via the CREB–CBP nuclear transduction pathway. Du
and Montminy showed recently that Akt overproduction
in serum-stimulated cells induced Ser133 phosphorylation of CREB and promoted the recruitment of CBP
(Ref. 52). There might be considerable convergence in
these pathways as Ca21/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase kinase, an enzyme that is crucial to the Ca21mediated transcriptional regulation of CREB, is able to
phosphorylate Akt directly and protect cells from apoptosis53. Indeed, a wide range of neuromodulators and
neurotransmitters could converge on CREB, via various
kinase pathways in neurons54, and regulate neuronal
survival and plasticity (Fig. 3). However, although many
neurotransmitters can lead to CREB phosphorylation
through activation of several second messengers and
kinases (for example, protein kinase C, PKA, MAPK)54

VIEWPOINT

M.R. Walton and M. Dragunow – CREB and neuronal survival

not all of these are neuroprotective, suggesting that the
relationship between CREB phosphorylation and nervecell survival is not a simple one. Combinatorial interactions with other induced or constitutive transcription
factors (transcriptional crosstalk) and the consequent
binding to additional cis-acting DNA elements is likely
to regulate CREB-mediated functions. In addition, persistent phosphorylation, which occurs in damageresistant dentate granule cells19 and in CREB-transfected
neuronal cells24, might be required to activate the genes
downstream of CREB that are involved in nerve-cell survival. This hypothesis is supported by a study showing
that hypoxia induces a more-robust and persistent
phosphorylation of CREB than forskolin or depolarization4. Thus, the plasticity genes whose expression is
produced by neuronal depolarization and the actions
of CREB, might differ from those whose expression is
activated by the persistent phosphorylation of CREB
that occurs after stressful stimuli (for example, hypoxia),
although one target gene, Bdnf, is likely to subserve
both functions17.

CREB-induced gene expression
The identities of target genes regulated by CREB in the
resistant dentate granule cells after brain injury remain
elusive, even though there are likely to be numerous
candidates, many of which have not yet been identified.
The Bcl2 gene might be one example, as the phosphorylation of CREB proteins has been shown to have a major
role in the induction of its expression during activation
of mature B cells and during the rescue of immature B
cells from Ca21-dependent apoptosis55. The Bcl2 gene
encodes a membrane-associated protein that can block
apoptosis and promote cell survival in many systems,
including the nervous system56. Moreover, increased
BCL2 levels in the dentate granule cells after brief
ischemia57 not only demonstrate a possible involvement
of this protein in ischemic tolerance and survival of
sub-lethally injured neurons, but also suggests that it
might be a downstream target for activated CREB.
However, this is unlikely to be the case in all systems as
changes in the levels of BCL2 or BCL2-related proteins
are not required for CREB-induced survival in human
melanoma cells26. Another candidate is the immediate–
early gene Mcl1, which codes for a novel Bcl2 family
member and mediates specific cytokine effects on cell
viability58. Interleukin 3 induces Mcl1 expression and
anti-apoptotic effects via an Akt–CREB signaling pathway58. Future studies using microarray technologies
could catalog the array of target genes activated by CREB
and identify survival programs in neurons.

Concluding remarks
There is a rapidly growing body of evidence to support
the concept that endogenous CREB activation might
provide a potent survival signal in times of cellular
stress. Not only has CREB phosphorylation been implicated in the resistance of cells to various insults, but a
number of well-established neuroprotective agents exert
their actions via pathways that converge on the CREB
protein. In particular, there is now evidence that the
Akt signaling pathway could lead to CREB phosphorylation and that the potent neuroprotective agent, insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF1), phosphorylates CREB partly
through this Akt pathway59. These combined results
suggest that CREB might be a key player in neuronal
survival following injury and therefore responsible, in

Fig. 3. The possible factors involved in CREB-induced survival within
the hippocampus. The phosphorylation (P) of cAMP-response-elementbinding protein (CREB) at Ser133 has been implicated in the signaling
pathway of a number of known neuroprotective factors (IGF1, estrogens,
PACAP, BDNF, PSA–NCAM). As this convergence is directed towards CREB,
it suggests that it might be an important event in neuroprotection and
therefore a key to selective vulnerability in the hippocampus. Exactly how
the phosphorylation of CREB leads to neuronal survival is, as yet, unclear,
but is likely to involve combinatorial interactions with other transcription
factors and to be mediated through the regulation of the expression of
downstream target genes, such as Bcl2, Mcl1 and Bdnf, as well as many
other unknown genes. Neurotransmitters (for example, ACh, dopamine,
noradrenaline, glutamate) can also lead to CREB phosphorylation at
Ser133 via activation of various kinases [for example, MAPK, PKA, protein
kinase C, Ca21/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, RSK2 (see Ref. 54)],
and some of these can activate CREB-mediated neuronal plasticity by the
downstream activation of transcription factors such as EGR1. Whether
these various downstream targets of CREB activation mediate both neuronal survival and plasticity is presently unclear. Abbreviations: BDNF,

part, for selective vulnerability within the mammalian
brain. Currently, the evidence supporting this hypothesis is correlational in vivo19–21 but causal in vitro24. It will
be vital to establish whether CREB phosphorylation is
neuroprotective in the brain, and whether various
neuroprotective agents (for example, IGF1) produce
neuroprotection by the sequential activation of Akt and
CREB. Studies on neurons derived from CREB-knockout
mice are now required to resolve these issues. In this
regard, one recent study has shown that after middle
cerebral artery occlusion, CREB knockout mice do not
show altered neurological scores60; however, these mice
were monitored for only 3 h after the insult, which is
before CREB-mediated neuroprotection would be activated. In addition, these mice had a targeted disruption
of the a and D isoforms of CREB with compensatory
increases in other forms60. Perhaps the best way of assessing the importance of endogenous CREB phosphorylation to neuronal survival would be to use viral transfection of hippocampal neurons with a dominant-negative
CREB construct. If the hypothesis is correct, then this
treatment should worsen HI- and seizure-induced

hippocampal injury, and block the neuroprotective
effects of compounds such as IGF1 and BDNF.
Conversely, overexpressing the gene for CREB should
protect neurons from various insults, as demonstrated
recently in primary cerebellar granule cells 61.
In addition to the proposed role for CREB in neuronal
survival, there is now extensive data showing that it is
crucial for memory formation14. Thus, CREB-protein targeting might be an ideal way to achieve neuroprotective
cognitive enhancement, a strategy that will have major
implications for treating Alzheimer’s disease, although,
as already discussed, whether genes activated by CREB
after learning are the same as those activated during
neuronal stress remains to be determined. For example,
differences in the degree and kinetics of CREB phosphorylation might lead to different functional outcomes.
The challenge for the future is to determine which genes
are activated during CREB-mediated neuroprotection
(and plasticity), and to develop novel approaches that
either mimic the actions of CREB in long-term memory
and survival, or enhance its endogenous activity within
the brain.

Dendritic spine formation and pruning:
common cellular mechanisms?
Menahem Segal, Eduard Korkotian and Diane D. Murphy
The recent advent of novel high-resolution imaging methods has created a flurry of exciting
observations that address a century-old question: what are biological signals that regulate
formation and elimination of dendritic spines? Contrary to the traditional belief that the spine is
a stable storage site of long-term neuronal memory,the emerging picture is of a dynamic structure
that can undergo fast morphological variations. Recent conflicting reports on the regulation of
spine morphology lead to the proposal of a unifying hypothesis for a common mechanism involving
changes in postsynaptic intracellular Ca21 concentration, [Ca21]i: a moderate rise in [Ca21]i causes
elongation of dendritic spines, while a very large increase in [Ca21]i causes fast shrinkage and
eventual collapse of spines. This hypothesis provides a parsimonious explanation for conflicting
reports on activity-dependent changes in dendritic spine morphology,and might link these changes
to functional plasticity in central neurons.
Trends Neurosci. (2000) 23, 53–57

INCE they were first described over a century ago by
Ramón y Cajal, dendritic spines were assumed to
constitute the site of neuronal plasticity and long-term
memory in central neurons. As such, they have attracted
tremendous attention from neuroscientists of all designations who have the desire to formulate common elementary rules that govern the formation, maturation
and disappearance of these spines. For example, is the
formation of dendritic spines a result of synaptic interaction with afferent inputs, or is it predetermined genetically, much like cell shape and transmitter content?
Likewise, is the formation of spines orchestrated centrally via nuclear signals, or locally, in response to synaptic demand? What are the roles of specific plasticityproducing stimuli, hormones and growth factors in the
mature neuron? What are the molecular events that
underlie long-term changes in spines, and how long do
they last? Most importantly, how is a change in spine
density, size or shape translated into a change in
synaptic function?
Pioneering studies in intact brain attempted to correlate dendritic spine morphology with stimulation of a
specific neural pathway, or environmental stimulation1,2.
Spine morphology was also correlated with cognitive
functions in the aging brain3. More recently, investigators have used various models of neuronal plasticity
for assaying activity-related changes in dendritic spines,
ranging from the induction of status epilepticus by

kainic acid4, pilocarpine5 or kindling6,7, to deafferentation of the cells of interest. Between the two extremes, more-natural stimuli, such as enriched environment8,9, learning tasks10,11 and controlled hormonal
states12,13, are used.
Experiments such as these have reported a wide range
of effects on dendritic spines. For example, the type of
tetanic stimulation that produces LTP (Ref. 14) can
produce changes in spine dimensions15, and synaptic
contact area and shape16. Bifurcation of spine head10 and
the formation of novel spines17 have also been reported.
A stronger, seizure-producing synaptic stimulation also
gives rise to varied effects on spines, either by forming
novel spines in places where they have not been seen
before (for example, somatic spines7) or by eliminating
existing ones18. Moreover, the interpretation of these
results is complicated when acute brain slices are used,
as slicing itself can cause almost a 50% increase in
spine density19.
Developmental studies can provide an important clue
as to the mechanisms of spine formation. Neurons are
born without dendrites or spines, and develop them
slowly over weeks as they become innervated by incoming fibers. It is difficult to discern whether the spines
are formed before or after the formation of synapses.
Recent in vivo electron-microscopy studies20 indicate that
incoming fibers make synapses with dendritic filopodia
that then become mature spines, suggesting that spines
