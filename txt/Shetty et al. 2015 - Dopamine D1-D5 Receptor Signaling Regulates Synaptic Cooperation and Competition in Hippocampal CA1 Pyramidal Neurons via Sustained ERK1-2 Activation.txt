Dopamine D1/D5 Receptor Signaling Regulates Synaptic Cooperation
and Competition in Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Neurons via
Sustained ERK1/2 Activation
Mahesh Shivarama Shetty,1,2 Suma Gopinadhan,1 and Sreedharan Sajikumar1,2*

ABSTRACT: Synaptic cooperation and competition are important
components of synaptic plasticity that tune synapses for the formation
of associative long-term plasticity, a cellular correlate of associative
long-term memory. We have recently reported that coincidental activation of weak synapses within the vicinity of potentiated synapses will
alter the cooperative state of synapses to a competitive state thus leading to the slow decay of long-term plasticity, but the molecular mechanism underlying this is still unknown. Here, using acute hippocampal
slices of rats, we have examined how increasing extracellular dopamine
concentrations interact and/or affect electrically induced long-term
potentiation (LTP) in the neighboring synapses. We demonstrate that
D1/D5-receptor-mediated potentiation at the CA1 Schaffer collateral
synapses differentially regulates synaptic co-operation and competition.
Further investigating the molecular players involved, we reveal an
important role for extracellular signal-regulated kinases-1 and 2 (ERK1/
2) as signal integrators and dose-sensors. Interestingly, a sustained activation of ERK1/2 pathway seems to be involved in the differential regulation of synaptic associativity. The concentration-dependent effects of
the modulatory transmitter, as demonstrated for dopaminergic signaling
in the present study, might offer additional computational power by
fine tuning synaptic associativity processes for establishing long-term

INTRODUCTION
The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is well recognized as a modulator of the plasticity processes underlying learning, memory, and emotional processing (Jay,
2003; Laviolette, 2007; Rossato et al., 2009). The hippocampal formation receives dopaminergic innervation
from both the substantia nigra pars compacta and the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) (Scatton et al., 1980;
Gasbarri et al., 1994). Among the dopamine receptor
subtypes, the D1-like receptors (comprising D1 and
D5; D1Rs) in the hippocampus are implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory as shown by a variety of
pharmacological and genetic approaches (Frey et al.,
1991, 1993; Matthies et al., 1997; Lemon and
Manahan-Vaughan, 2006; Granado et al., 2008). Particularly, D1R-mediated mechanisms are crucial for
the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of longterm potentiation (LTP) and long-term memory
(LTM) (Frey and Schroeder, 1990; Matthies et al.,
1997; Rossato et al., 2009) because of their involvement in inducing the plasticity-related products
(PRPs)(Moncada et al., 2011; Redondo and Morris,
2011). As demonstrated recently, the midbrain dopaminergic neuron activity also promotes hippocampal
network dynamics associated with memory persistence
(McNamara et al., 2014).
The upregulation of PRPs is an essential component of
the synaptic tagging and capture (STC) hypothesis (Frey
and Morris, 1997, 1998), which provides a conceptual
basis to account for late-associative interactions of plasticity events. It proposes that weak activation of synapses
during LTP-induction results in instantaneous local ‘tagging’ of activated synapses, which later ‘captures’ the diffusely transports PRPs synthesized in the soma or local
dendritic domains. This is supported by studies showing
dopamine-dependent facilitation of CA1 LTP by spatial
novelty (Li et al., 2003) and the behavioral tagging experiments in which dopaminergic activation, along with betaadrenergic activation, is shown to be involved in the synthesis of PRPs required to consolidate inhibitory avoidance LTM (Moncada et al., 2011).

Hippocampal DA acting through D1Rs is proposed to
mediate informational saliency and thus promote the persistence of long-term memories (Hansen and Manahan-Vaughan,
2014). The hippocampus and VTA connections form a loop
that modulates encoding and integration of motivationally relevant, novel, and reward-related information (Lisman and
Grace, 2005). Additionally, hippocampal D1R activation modulates the locomotor activity and also dopamine efflux in the
nucleus accumbens (Zornoza et al., 2005), thus extending its
significance to addiction and reward-related mechanisms.
Altered dopaminergic signaling and modulation has been
implicated in the pathophysiology of many neuropsychiatric
disorders and also in the age-associated memory deficits. Consequently, administration of dopamine agonists has been
reported in many cases to alleviate or restore the alterations.
However, dopaminergic signaling is known to exhibit dosedependent effects in many brain regions with linear or nonlinear profiles (Williams and Millar, 1990; Zheng et al., 1999;
Chao et al., 2002). In prefrontal cortex, low levels of D1R
activation is proposed to serve a role in sculpting neural selectivity by increasing neural signal-to-noise ratio (Puig and
Miller, 2012). However, whether the functional response of
dopaminergic signaling differs over a wide range of DA concentrations in hippocampus remains to be explored. Interestingly, bath application of D1R agonists or DA itself induces a
slow-onset potentiation in acute hippocampal slices in vitro
that occludes electrically induced LTP (Huang and Kandel,
1995; Navakkode et al., 2012). This raises important concerns
on how the changes in the extracellular dopamine concentrations influence the ongoing information processing and affect
the encoding and maintenance of memories. Here, we have
investigated whether different degrees of D1R activation could
lead to differential outcomes in the context of late-associative
mechanisms. Given that D1R-activation leads to robust activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in CA1
region (Roberson et al., 1999), we have also explored their
potential role in this context.

METHODS

the cold (2–48C) aCSF being continuously bubbled with carbogen. Transverse hippocampal slices of 400 lm thickness were
prepared from the right hippocampus using a manual tissue
chopper (Stoelting, Wood Dale, Illinois), transferred onto a
nylon net in an interface chamber (Scientific Systems Design,
Ontario, Canada) and incubated at 328C at an aCSF flow rate
of 1 mL/min and carbogen consumption of 16 l/h. The whole
process, from anaesthetization to the transfer of slices to the
chamber, was carried out very quickly with an average duration
of 5 minutes. The slices were incubated for at least 3 hours
before starting the experiments.

Field Potential Recordings
Monopolar, lacquer-coated, stainless steel electrodes (5 MX;
AM Systems, Sequim, Washington) were used as stimulating
and recording electrodes. Stimulating electrodes were positioned within the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region to stimulate Schaffer collaterals and the field-EPSP responses were
recorded with an electrode placed in the CA1 distal apical dendritic region. After the preincubation period of at least 3 h, an
input–output curve (stimulus intensity vs. fEPSP slope) was
plotted for each input and the test stimulus intensity was set to
obtain a fEPSP slope 40% of the maximal response. The signals were amplified by a differential amplifier, digitized using a
CED 1401 analog-to-digital converter (Cambridge Electronic
Design, Cambridge, UK) and monitored online with custommade software.
In all experiments, a stable baseline was recorded for at least
30 minutes before chemical or electrical LTP induction. Four
0.2-Hz biphasic, constant current pulses (spaced at 5s) given
every five minutes were used for baseline and post-induction
recording and the average slope value from the four sweeps was
considered as one repeat while used for plotting. For two- and
three-input synaptic tagging and capture experiments, the stimulating electrodes were placed on either side of the recording
electrode so as to stimulate two or three independent set of
synapses respectively. A paired-pulse facilitation protocol (Li
et al., 2014; Sajikumar et al., 2014) was used to test the independence of the two inputs. Initial slopes of fEPSPs were
expressed as percentages of baseline averages.

Preparation of Hippocampal Slices

Statistics

A total of 181 acute hippocampal slices prepared from 125
male Wistar rats (6–7 week old) were used in the study. All
animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of National University of
Singapore. Briefly, after anaesthetization using CO2, the rats
were decapitated and the brains were quickly removed to 48C
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF)—a modified Krebs-Ringer
solution containing the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 3.7
KCl, 1.2 KH2PO4, 1 MgSO47H2O, 2.5 CaCl22H2O, 24.6
NaHCO3, and 10 D-glucose. The pH of aCSF was between
7.3 and 7.4 when bubbled with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon
dioxide (carbogen). Right hippocampus was dissected out in

The time-matched, normalized data were averaged across
replicate experiments and expressed as mean 6 SEM. The average percentage values of fEPSP slope per time point were subjected to statistical analysis with GraphPad Prism 6.0.
Whenever the data did not conform to Gaussian distribution,
nonparametric tests were used. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed
rank test was used when comparisons were made within group.
Multiple, between group comparisons for specified time-points
were performed with either one-way or two-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s or Dunnet’s post-hoc tests. Statistical significance was
assumed at P < 0.05. (*P < 0.05 **P < 0.01 ***P < 0.001,
****P < 0.0001).

LTP Induction Protocols
For early-LTP induction, a weak tetanization protocol
(WTET) consisting of a single high frequency stimulation (100
Hz, 21 biphasic constant current pulses, single burst, 0.2 ms
pulse duration) was used. For late-LTP induction, a strong tetanization protocol (STET) involving repeated high-frequency
stimulation (three trains of 100 Hz, 100 pulses, single burst,
0.2 ms pulse duration) was used with an intertrain interval of
ten minutes.

Drugs
The D1/D5-receptor agonist SKF-38393 hydrochloride
[(6)21-Phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-(1H)23-benzazepine-7,8-diol
hydrochloride] (SKF; #D047, Sigma-Aldrich, Singapore) was
stored at 2208C as 15–50 mM stock in deionized water.
Another agonist 6-Bromo-APB hydrobromide [R(1)26-Bromo7,8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrobromide] (APB; #B135, Sigma-Aldrich, Singapore)
was stored as 15–50 mM stock in DMSO at 2208C. The
stocks were stored for not more than a week. Just before application, the stocks were diluted to the final concentration in aCSF,
bubbled with carbogen, and bath applied for three 5-minute
durations with 5-minute interval between each application. The
drugs were protected from light during storage and bath application was carried out under dark conditions.
The MEK inhibitor U0126 (#V1121, Promega, Madison,
Wisconsin) was stored as 20 mM stock in DMSO. Other MEK
inhibitor PD98059 (#9900L, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
Massachusetts) was stored as 50 mM stock in DMSO at 2208C
and diluted in aCSF just before application. Both the MEK
inhibitors were applied after one hour from the start of SKF
application and kept throughout the rest of recording period.
Whenever the drug stock was prepared in DMSO, the
DMSO concentration in the final bath-application solution
was kept below 0.1%, a concentration which has been shown
to not affect basal synaptic responses (Navakkode et al., 2005).

RESULTS
Different Concentrations of D1/D5-Receptor
Agonists Induce Slow-Onset Potentiation in CA1
Pyramidal Neurons
Dopamine or D1R agonists have been shown to induce a
slow-onset potentiation of field-EPSP slopes in hippocampal
CA1 region (Gribkoff and Ashe, 1984; Frey et al., 1993;
Huang and Kandel, 1995). First series of experiments involved
the application of a selective D1R agonist SKF-38393 (SKF) at
a range of concentrations from 50 mM to 0.1 mM. We chose
these concentrations as many of the studies have generally used
a concentration of 50–100 mM (Huang and Kandel, 1995;
Roberson et al., 1999; Navakkode et al., 2007; Navakkode
et al., 2012) and we were interested to know whether lower

3

concentrations are also capable of inducing a persistent potentiation. As a control experiment, first we recorded stable baseline potentials by delivering low-frequency test stimulation
every five minutes in synaptic input S1 (Fig. 1b). The baseline
response remained stable over 3 hours. Though a small drift in
the responses was observed between 120 and 140 minutes, it
was not statistically significant at any time point (P > 0.05,
n 5 6). In the next series of experiments, after a stable baseline
recording of at least 30 minutes, SKF was applied in three 5minute durations with 5-minute interval between applications.
This application paradigm is analogous to the spaced strong
tetanization protocols used to induce late-LTP (Navakkode
et al., 2007).
Application of 50 mM SKF resulted in a slow-onset potentiation similar to earlier reports (Huang and Kandel, 1995; Navakkode et al., 2007). The potentiation became significantly
different from the baseline 35 minutes after the first application (118.1 6 3.06%, P<0.05) and maintained over 4 hours.
The mean potentiation at the end of 4 hours was
(155.12 6 7.28)% (n 5 6, Fig. 1c). With 25 mM SKF application also a slow-onset potentiation was observed that became
significantly different from baseline by 25 minutes
[(116 6 2.84)% P < 0.01)]. The mean potentiation at the end
of 4 hours was (148.77 6 5.52)% (P < 0.01, n 5 10, Fig. 1d).
Similar was the result with 10 mM SKF application; the potentiation was significantly different after 20 minutes
(114.2 6 5.78% P<0.01) and stayed significant for 4 hours
(132.03 6 4.71%, P<0.01; n58, Fig. 1e). Interestingly, even
with 5 mM SKF application, a late-onset potentiation was
observed that became significantly different rather slowly by 90
minutes (115.05 6 5.63%, P<0.05) and stayed significant
thereafter till the end of recording [(126.30 6 8.20)%,
P < 0.05, n 5 8, Fig. 1f )]. Application of further lower concentrations of SKF, 1 mM and 0.1 mM, failed to induce any significant potentiation; the mean potentiation at the end of 4 hours
being (107.52 6 3.78)% (P > 0.05, n 5 8, Fig. 1g) and
(98.71 6 8.23)% (P > 0.05, n 5 8, Fig. 1h) respectively.
A plot of the mean potentiation induced by the different
concentrations of SKF at the end of 4 hours revealed a
concentration-dependent response (Fig. 1i). A one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) comparing these normalized group
means to baseline (100%) showed a significant difference
between the mean values (F(6, 51) 5 16.02; P < 0.0001). Multiple comparisons with the Dunnett’s post-test showed that
potentiation was significantly different from the baseline with 5
mM (P < 0.01), 10 mM (P < 0.001), 25 mM (P < 0.0001) and
50 mM (P < 0.0001) groups whereas not with 1 mM
(P > 0.05) and 0.1 mM (P > 0.05) groups.
We repeated these experiments with another structurally different D1R analogue, 6-bromo-APB (APB), and obtained similar concentration-dependent response (Supporting Information
Fig. 1a–g).
Taken together, these series of experiments showed that the
D1R-mediated potentiation at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses is concentration-dependent.

Dose-Dependent Regulation of Synaptic
Cooperation and Competition by Dopaminergic
Signaling
Having observed the concentration-dependent response of
the D1R-mediated potentiation, next we were interested to
know whether such effects might have any significance during
the associative information processing at the input level.
To investigate this, we designed a series of two-pathway
experiments based on the conceptual framework of STC
model. Two-pathway experiments utilizing either a ‘strongbefore-weak’ or ‘weak-before-strong’ protocols, in which strong
and weak activity are given sequentially to two independent
but convergent inputs, have proven effective in addressing heterosynaptic and late-associative mechanisms (Frey and Morris,
1997). We planned similar experiments reasoning that the
potentiation induced by D1R agonists is analogous to strong
tetanisation, and input specificity in this case can be achieved
by selective silencing of the test stimulation in one input during agonist application (Navakkode et al., 2007). Two stimulating electrodes were positioned in the stratum radiatum of the
CA1 region to stimulate two independent synaptic inputs converging onto a common population of neurons and a recoding
electrode was located midway between the two stimulating
electrodes to record the field-EPSP responses (Fig. 2a). SKF
was bath applied in three, spaced applications. However, during drug application the baseline stimulation was silenced in
one of the inputs (S2) for one hour from the point of drug
application. Thus agonist-induced potentiation would be
induced only in the active input (S1) but not in the silenced
input (S2). After one hour, the test stimulation was resumed in
the silenced input and upon 30 minutes of baseline recording,
early-LTP (E-LTP) was induced by weak tetanisation (WTET)
of S2.
Twenty five micromolars of SKF-induced potentiation in
input S1 became significantly different from its baseline after
20 minutes and maintained for 4 hours (Fig. 2b. P < 0.05,
n 5 7). However, input S2 in which the baseline stimulation
was silenced for one hour showed no potentiation after resuming the recording (P > 0.05). Weak tetanisation of S2 resulted
in significant potentiation (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the WTET,
which normally induces only an E-LTP (data not shown),

resulted in a late-LTP with a mean potentiation of
(139.98 6 10.72)% after two hours that was significantly different from its baseline (Fig. 2b. P < 0.05, n 5 7).
With 10 mM SKF application, input S1 showed significant
potentiation by 20 minutes (P < 0.05) that sustained for 4
hours (Fig. 2c. P < 0.05, n 5 7). Similar to the experiment
with 25 mM SKF, the silenced input S2 did not show potentiation after resuming the baseline stimulation (P > 0.05). WTET
in S2 resulted in significant potentiation from the baseline
(P < 0.05). Strikingly, the WTET-induced potentiation did not
get reinforced into late-LTP as with 25 mM SKF, but rather
decayed to baseline gradually with the mean potentiation of
(108.69 6 8.89)% after two hours that was not significantly
different from its baseline (Fig. 2c. P > 0.05, n 5 7).
The result was much more intriguing with 5 mM SKF
wherein input S1 failed to show significant potentiation [mean
potentiation after 100 minutes (109.78 6 7.26)%, P > 0.05;
Fig. 2d, n 5 9)]. Input S2, upon WTET, showed a significant
potentiation (P < 0.05, n 5 9) that rapidly decayed back to
baseline becoming not significantly different by 160 minutes
(P > 0.05).

Late-Plasticity Within the Vicinity of Competing
Synapses Prevents Synaptic Competition
From the previous series of experiments, we hypothesized
that the decay of both the E-LTP and D1R-mediated potentiation in 5 mM SKF experiments could be because of the competition between these two set of active synapses for a limited
pool of PRPs. So, we reasoned that providing additional PRPs
by means of strong stimulation within the temporal vicinity of
weakly activated synapses should prevent decaying forms of
LTP because synthesis of PRPs during late-LTP requires D1R
activation (Frey and Schroeder, 1990; Sajikumar and Frey,
2004). For this we designed the three-pathway experiments
with three independent but convergent inputs S1, S2, and S3
in the stratum radiatum of CA1 region and a recording electrode positioned in between to record the fEPSP responses
(Fig. 3a). Similar to two-pathway experiments, before the
application of SKF, the test stimulations in S2 and S3 inputs
were silenced for the next one hour, so as to achieve inputspecific D1R-mediated potentiation in S1. After one hour, the

recordings in S2 and S3 were resumed and a stable baseline of
30 minutes was recorded. E-LTP was induced with a WTET
in S2 and 15 minutes later late-LTP was induced in S3 by a
strong tetanization protocol (STET).
The D1R-LTP in S1 followed the similar time-course as in
two-pathway experiments, and the potentiation was not significantly different from the baseline until 90 minutes (P > 0.05,
n 57). Inputs S2 and S3 showed no significant deviation from
baseline upon resuming the stimulation (P > 0.05). WTET in

S2 resulted in significant potentiation (P < 0.05). Significant
potentiation was observed in S3 upon STET (P < 0.05, n 5 7)
that lasted till the end of the recording [mean potentiation at
the end of 4 hours (149.25 6 7.76%), P<0.05]. Interestingly,
the otherwise decaying potentiation was rescued in S1 [mean
potentiation at 4 h (119.35 6 4.13)%, P < 0.05] and S2 [mean
potentiation at 4 h (119.95 6 2.92)%, P < 0.05] clearly demonstrating the rescue because of the provision of extra PRPs
from S3.

Sustained Activation of Extracellular SignalRegulated Kinases- 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) Mediates
Differential Effects of D1/D5 receptorDependent Plasticity

permanent adaptive changes (Papadeas et al., 2004). Here we
investigated whether inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK1/2 interferes with the maintenance
of repeated D1R agonist-induced potentiation. We addressed
this by using the specific inhibitors of the upstream kinases of
ERK1/2 (MEKs), U0126, and PD98059. The inhibitor was
applied one hour after the SKF application and kept throughout until the end of the recording so as to investigate the effect
on the LTP maintenance mechanism.
The potentiation induced by 5 mM SKF reached significance
on a similar time-course as in the previous experiments.

Application of dopamine to hippocampal slices has been
shown to result in robust activation of p42 MAP kinase in
CA1 region (Roberson et al., 1999). Sustained ERK phosphorylation has been reported in the medial prefrontal cortex of 6hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats following repeated D1R agonist
administration which was proposed to play a pivotal role in

However, with the application of 5 mM U0126 from 60
minutes onwards, the maintenance of potentiation was affected;
the potentiation was only marginally significant by 120
minutes (P < 0.05) and gradually decayed back to baseline
becoming not significantly different from the baseline 145
minutes onwards (P > 0.05, Fig. 4a, n 5 7). The mean potentiation at the end of 4 hours was (97.03 6 5.28)% (P > 0.05).
Similar blockade of the LTP maintenance was observed also
with the application of 15 mM PD98059; the mean potentiation at the end of 4 hours was (97.58 6 10.46)% (Supporting
Information Fig. 2a. P > 0.999, n 5 6).
Interestingly, the potentiation induced by 10 mM SKF was
also disrupted by the application of 5 mM U0126 (Fig. 4b,
n 5 7) or 15 mM PD98059 (Supporting Information Fig. 2b,
n 5 6) during the maintenance phase. The potentiation followed the usual time-course and became significantly different
by 20 minutes (P<0.01) and stayed significant until 130
minutes with U0126 (P < 0.05) and until 100 minutes with
PD98059 (P<0.05), later gradually decayed back to baseline.
The mean values at the end of 4 hours were not significantly
different from the baseline in both cases (P > 0.05).
Surprisingly, 5 mM U0126 application showed no significant
effect on the maintenance of potentiation induced by 25 mM
SKF (Fig. 4c, n 5 6) as did 15 mM PD98059 (Supporting
Information Fig. 2c, n 5 6). The potentiation became significantly different from the baseline by around 30 minutes in
both cases (P < 0.05) and stayed significant throughout. The
mean potentiation at the end of 4 hours was
(147.99 6 11.11)% with U0126 treatment (P < 0.05) and
(135.98 6 10.61)% with PD98059 treatment (P < 0.05). We
gradually increased the concentration of the inhibitors applied
and observed a significant disruption of the maintenance phase
within the experimental time-frame with 10 mM U0126 (Fig.
4d, n 5 6) and 30 mM PD98059 (Supporting Information Fig.
2d, n 5 7) application. In these experiments, potentiation
induced by 25 mM SKF was only significant up to 115
minutes with U0126 treatment (Fig. 4d, P<0.05) and up to
125 minutes with PD98059 treatment (Supporting Information Fig. 2d, P < 0.05) and decayed to baseline thereafter. At
the end of 4 hours, the potentiation was not significantly different from the baseline in both groups (P>0.05).
A two-way repeated measures ANOVA, comparing different
SKF concentration groups and U0126-treatment groups with
matched values (i.e., time points 60 min and 240 min compared to baseline) stacked into subcolumns (Fig. 4e), revealed a
significant variation between time-points (F(2,92) 5 37.50;
P < 0.0001) and between groups (F(6,46) 5 4.51; P < 0.001).
Analysis of simple effects between groups with Tukey’s multiple
comparisons test showed significant differences between the
‘SKF-treated’ and ‘SKF1U0126 treated’ groups at 240
minutes. Five micromolars of U0126 treatment significantly
blocked potentiation by 240 minutes in 5 mM SKF-treated
group, as compared with the 5 mM SKF group without U0126
treatment (P < 0.05). The potentiation induced by 10 mM
SKF was also brought back to baseline values by 240 minutes
with 5 mM U0126 treatment as compared with the potentiaHippocampus

tion in 10 mM SKF-treated group (P < 0.001). There was no
statistically significant difference in the potentiation at 240
minutes between the 25 mM SKF group and the ‘25 mM
SKF15 mM U0126’ group (P > 0.05). Finally, 25 mM SKFinduced potentiation was significantly blocked by 10 mM
U0126 treatment, as evident from the statistically significant
difference as compared with 25 mM SKF group (P<0.0001)
and also compared with 25 mM SKF group treated with 5 mM
U0126 (P < 0.001).
Similar results were also obtained when these experiments
were repeated with another MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Supporting Information Fig. 2e). Though in these series of experiments the concentration of PD98059 required to disrupt the
LTP maintenance was higher than that of U0126, it was
expected as the potency of this inhibitor is low compared to
U0126 (Favata et al., 1998; Levenson et al., 2004). Further,
application of either of the MEK inhibitor at the concentrations used above had no significant effect on the baseline
fEPSP responses (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Our first series of experiments reveal that the D1R agonistevoked potentiation at the Schaffer collateral inputs to CA1
apical dendrites exhibits concentration-dependence. With the
growing appreciation of the importance of heterosynaptic
dopaminergic activation in the induction and maintenance of
late-LTP, in certain forms of hippocampus-dependent memory
and also in certain neuropsychiatric disorders, these results
present a significant aspect to consider both in physiological as
well as pathological conditions.
Huang and Kandel (1995) had observed that the D1R agonist application results in a potentiation that develops slowly
and peaks by 3–4 hours, whereas in our study the development
was comparatively faster. This could be attributed to the methodological differences such as extended preincubation periods
and to the drug application paradigms; in that study the agonist was applied in a massed fashion continuously for 15
minutes whereas in our study we used a spaced application
protocol (Navakkode et al., 2007; Navakkode et al., 2012)
The two-pathway experiments, designed on the synaptic tagging and capture framework, suggest that the concentrationdependence of dopaminergic modulation has significance during the processing of information from multiple inputs at the
cellular level. Sufficiently strong dopaminergic activation might
have resulted in the upregulation of a battery of PRPs, which
could also be captured by an active weak learning tag. Thus
the PRPs, upregulated in sufficiently large amounts, could be
shared between both the active set of synapses resulting in a
stable plasticity and associativity. These results are consistent
with our earlier findings that if plasticity proteins and learning
tags are available to interact, the synapses will co-operate with
each other for forming stable memory traces (Sajikumar and

Frey, 2004). The learning rules change when the concentration
of the dopamine decreases. For instance, with lower concentration of D1R agonist, such as 10 mM in our study, the earlyLTP induced in the overlapping input was not consolidated.
This represents a situation where only one input gets selectively
benefitted from the PRPs while not sharing it with the other
input active in the critical time-window for association; a situation similar to ‘winner-takes-it-all’ scenario reported recently by
us and others (Kano and Hashimoto, 2009; Sajikumar et al.,
2014). Thus there was no late-associativity or cooperation
between these synapses. The intriguing observation with 5 lM
D1R agonist application, wherein potentiation in both inputs
decayed to baseline, possibly indicates a scenario similar to
‘competitive maintenance’ (Fonseca et al., 2004) where both
the activated set of synapses compete for PRPs from a limited
pool which affects the LTP-maintenance in both. Thus the
amount of PRPs upregulated at this concentration was not
enough to be shared between synapses. This was further supported by the three-pathway experiment, where providing additional PRPs with a strong activity in a convergent input was
able to rescue the synapses from competition. Thus it reveals
two important aspects of the dynamic nature of the synapses
involved in associative memory: (1) With limited availability of
plasticity products, synapses will still try to establish a stable
memory in the face of competition, sometimes in a winnertakes–all fashion, given that the active synaptic tags were set
initially, (2) If enough plasticity products are provided within
the vicinity of potentiated synapses, all the synapses will switch
to a cooperative state to establish a stable long-term memory
trace which would have decayed otherwise because of competition. Thus, we have identified a process in switching the synapses between co-operative to competitive states to deal with
different needs of neural computation mediated by dopamine.
Provoked by the interesting results from the co-operative and
competitive aspect of synapses, we sought to understand the
molecular players involved in the associative maintenance. Given
the results, it was clear that the central molecular player in such a
scenario should be able to integrate the signals from the D1Rs
and the NMDA receptors and transduce the signals for the upregulation of PRPs in a concentration-dependent manner. The
potential candidates are the ERK1/2, given their well-documented
roles in the mammalian associative learning (Atkins et al., 1998),
their capability to act as signal integrators (Roberson et al., 1999;
Sweatt, 2001; Selcher et al., 2003; Davis and Laroche, 2006),

and their ability to both upregulate translation and also translocate to nucleus and activate transcription (Sweatt, 2001). In hippocampus, a strong synergistic interaction between D1R and
NMDAR has been reported (Navakkode et al., 2007), which
then leads to a significant activation of ERK1/2 pathway (Sarantis
et al., 2009). ERKs are involved in gating late-phase mechanisms
of LTP and long-term memory in hippocampus (English and
Sweatt, 1996; Blum et al., 1999; Roberson et al., 1999).
A particularly interesting observation in our study is that a
sustained ERK activation was involved in the maintenance of
D1R-mediated long-lasting potentiation. We have also examined the role of other PRPs such as calcium/calmodulindependent kinases CaMKII and CaMKIV using different concentrations of the inhibitor KN-93 and our preliminary results
show no significant role for these two kinases in the maintenance phase of D1R-mediated potentiation (Unpublished
results). Several studies have suggested similar sustained ERK
activation in response to a variety of stimuli such as repeated
serotonin pulses in aplysia neurons (Sharma et al., 2003), LTPinducing high frequency stimulation (Ahmed and Frey, 2005),
BDNF application (Wu et al., 2001) and in response to memory training in novel taste-learning task (Swank and Sweatt,
2001). Such persistent activation can be the result of many
possible scenarios as indicated by Wu et al., (2001). Maharana
et al. (2013) found that sustained ERK activation observed in
KCl-induced depolarization was dependent on BDNF synthesis
and its subsequent activity on its receptor. A propagating ERK
activation switch facilitated by feedback events has been proposed to form dendritic zones where plasticity is facilitated
(Ajay and Bhalla, 2007). Many other positive-feedback loops
may connect active ERK to Raf or MEK activity (Smolen
et al., 2008). Bistability of MAPKs has been proposed as a
plausible mechanism wherein persistent activity of the kinase
and consequent upregulation of translation might contribute to
maintenance of LTP and LTM (Smolen et al., 2008). PKMzeta, a persistently active atypical protein kinase C isoform, has
been shown to be necessary for maintenance of late-LTP, and
some forms of LTM (Serrano et al., 2005; Pastalkova et al.,
2006; Sacktor, 2012) and MAPK activity promotes translation
of PKM-zeta mRNA (Kelly et al., 2007). PKMzeta was
reported to be essential for induction and maintenance of
dopamine-LTP in CA1 region (Navakkode et al., 2010). So, it
is possible that persistent ERK activity could contribute to LTP
maintenance by increasing PKM-zeta synthesis.

FIGURE 4.
ERK1/2 inhibition concentration-dependently blocks the maintenance of D1/D5-agonist-induced potentiation: Following 30 minutes of baseline recoding, SKF was applied for three
5-minute durations with 5-minute interval between each application. The MEK-inhibitor, U0126, at the specified concentration,
was applied starting 1 h after SKF application till the end of 4 h
(shown in rectangles on each graph) (a) 5 lM SKF-induced potentiation was disrupted from maintenance upon application of 5 lM
U0126 (n 5 7). (b) Application of 5 lM U0126 also disrupted the
maintenance of the potentiation induced by 10 lM SKF (n 5 7). (c)
5 lM U0126 application had no significant effects on the potentia-

tion induced by 25 lM SKF (n 5 6). (d) Maintenance of 25 lM
SKF-induced potentiation was disrupted by 10 lM U0126 application causing the potentiation to gradually decay back to baseline

DOPAMINERGIC REGULATION OF SYNAPTIC ASSOCIATIVITY
Further, our results show that the ERK involvement in D1R
agonist-induced potentiation also follows a concentrationdependent activation pattern. Much higher concentration of
MEK inhibitors was required to completely block the LTP
induced by stronger dopaminergic activation as compared with
that required to block the LTP induced by weaker dopaminergic stimulation. This suggests that the level of ERK1/2 activation is more with stronger dopaminergic stimulation than with
weaker stimulation. In consistent with our findings, similar
dose-dependent activation of ERK1/2 by a D1R agonist has
been reported earlier in the mouse prefrontal cortex and also in
cultured cortical neurons (Nagai et al., 2007). In a Pavlovian
fear conditioning study in amygdala, ERK/MAPK activation
was shown to be peaking only by 60 minutes after conditioning and a MEK-inhibitor application impaired fear memory
consolidation in a dose-dependent manner and rapidly disrupted the LTP in the slices (Schafe et al., 2000).
The correlation between the activation patterns of the
ERK1/2 with the level of potentiation observed at different
agonist concentrations suggests a dose-sensor or signal integrator role for ERK1/2 in maintaining plasticity and associative
plasticity. ERK activation upon synaptic activity has been proposed to occur in the calcium microdomains in the proximity
of synaptic NMDA receptors (Hardingham et al., 2001). It is
possible that the stronger dopaminergic activation might
involve many such microdomains whereas weaker activation
might involve fewer. It has been reported earlier that coactivation of NMDARs and D1/D5-receptors leads to the
stimulation of ERK and phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3
kinase) resulting in the dendritic synthesis of many proteins
and also initiates the insertion of glutamate receptors to the
synaptic surface (Pfeiffer and Huber, 2006). Active ERK has
many downstream targets. ERK activation leads to upregulation of dendritic translation by acting through mTOR pathway
(Tsokas et al., 2007; Schicknick et al., 2008) and capdependent local translation via MAP-kinase-interacting kinase1 (MNK1) and eIF4E (Banko et al., 2004; Kelleher et al.,
2004). ERK can activate transcription factor cyclic-AMP
response element-binding protein (CREB) by multiple routes:
by activating the Ribosomal S6-Kinase-2 (RSK2) which can
then translocate to nucleus or the phospho-ERK itself can
translocate to nucleus (Davis et al., 2000) and directly phosphorylate CREB (Impey et al., 1998). CREB is one of the
important plasticity proteins necessary for the establishment of
associative plasticity (Barco et al., 2002). Through mediation
of RSK2 activation, ERK can also activate the transcription
factor Elk-1(Davis et al., 2000; Sweatt, 2001) which can lead
to transcription of Serum-response-element (SRE)-dependent
genes, important ones among them being c-fos (Janknecht
et al., 1993; Xia et al., 1996) and arc (Waltereit et al., 2001).
Though some studies have also shown a role for ERK in certain forms of long-term depression (Thiels et al., 2002; Gallagher et al., 2004) it has been suggested that the specificity of
the response might be determined by the pattern of the synaptic activity and by the differential involvement of the many
small GTPases (Gallagher et al., 2004).

11

Given the evidence that ERK-mediated effects on LTP maintenance involves its action both on local translation machinery
and nuclear transcriptional events (Davis and Laroche, 2006),
an interesting possibility is that the extent of contribution from
both of these events might have differential outcomes. The
exact feedback mechanisms involved in persistent ERK activation in our study, the signal integration mechanisms, and the
downstream targets of ERKs involved in the regulation of synaptic cooperation and competition will be the focus of future
studies. Also, it will be interesting to examine whether similar
effects could be observed in behavioral studies. However,
whether similar mechanisms of ERK activation could be
observed in mice is warranted as ERK involvement in certain
forms of LTP have been shown to differ between rats and mice
(Selcher et al., 2003).
Synaptic associative events such as synaptic tagging and capture have gained a lot of supportive evidence recently with
studies demonstrating such mechanisms in anesthetized and
freely moving animals, both from electrophysiological recordings and behavioral paradigms (Ballarini et al., 2009; Redondo
and Morris, 2011; Shires et al., 2012). Behavioral tagging
experiments demonstrating the reinforcement of a weak inhibitory avoidance memory into long-lasting one by the open-field
exploration paradigm have indicated the involvement of dopaminergic signaling in such behavioral outcomes (Moncada and
Viola, 2007). A similar facilitation has also been shown in a
spatial memory task (Wang et al., 2010) Very recently, such a
mechanism was also reported to operate in retroactive strengthening of emotional memories in humans (Dunsmoor et al.,
2015). Concomitant recruitment of homosynaptic and heterosynaptic modulatory mechanisms can help tune the specificity
of the plasticity and enhance the duration of the plastic change
(Bailey et al., 2000)
Taken together, our results present an interesting aspect of
dopaminergic modulation of associative information processing
in hippocampal CA1 neurons that the dopamine-mediated
effects exhibit concentration-dependence leading to differential
activation of intracellular mechanisms. Such effects can significantly influence the persistence or elimination of plasticity
events occurring in specific dendritic compartments and thus
convey different learning rules to same neurons. Given that the
extracellular dopamine levels are affected by many drugs used
to treat neuropsychiatric disorders and also some of the addictive drugs, our results indicate an important aspect to consider
in studies aiming to understand and treat these conditions.
The concentration-dependent effects of the modulatory transmitter, as demonstrated for dopamine in the present study,
might offer additional computational power and fine-tuning
for the cellular information processing mechanisms for longterm associative memory.
