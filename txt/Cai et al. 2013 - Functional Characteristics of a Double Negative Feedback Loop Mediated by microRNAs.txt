Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small,
noncoding RNAs that play crucial roles in almost all cellular processes. As key post-transcriptional regulators of
gene expression, miRNAs mainly induce mRNA degradation or translational repression. Recently computational
and experimental studies have identified an abundance of
motifs involving miRNAs and transcriptional factors (TFs).
Here, we study the functional characteristics of one such
motif, a two-node miRNA-mediated double negative
feedback loop (MDNFL) in which a TF suppresses an
miRNA and the TF itself is negatively regulated by the
miRNA. Several examples of this motif are described from
the literature. We propose a general computational model
for the MDNFL based on biochemical regulations and
explore its dynamics by using bifurcation analysis. Our
results show that the MDNFL can behave as a bistable
switch. This functional feature is in agreement with
experimental observations of the widespread appearance of
miRNAs in fate decisions such as differentiation during
development. Importantly, it is found that under the interplay of a TF and an miRNA, the MDNFL model can
behave as switches for wide ranges of parameters even
without cooperative binding of the TF. In addition, we also
investigate how extrinsic noise affects dynamic behavior of
the MDNFL. Interestingly, it is found that when the
MDNFL is in the bistable region, by choosing the appropriate extrinsic noise source, the MDNFL system can

switch from one steady state to the other and meanwhile
the production of either miRNA or protein is amplified
significantly. From an engineering perspective, this noisebased switch and amplifier for gene expression is very easy
to control. It is hoped that the results presented here would
provide a new insight on how gene expression is regulated
by miRNAs and further guidance for experiments.

Introduction
Living cells can continuously react to their environment
with specific biochemical responses. At the core of this
functionality are the interaction networks of biochemical
molecules, such as genes, proteins, metabolites, and small
molecules. Over the past decade, the structures of a great
deal of such networks, including protein–protein interaction, metabolic, signaling, and transcription regulatory
networks, have been mapped out. For the transcriptional
regulation networks and protein–protein interaction networks of different organisms, large-scale statistical analysis has uncovered that these networks are far from random
and contain significantly recurring nontrivial patterns of
interconnections termed network motifs, such as negative
autoregulation, feed-forward loops, and feedback loops
(Shen-Orr et al. 2002; Lee 2002; Wuchty et al. 2003). In
addition, several motifs of mixed interaction, including two
types of interactions: those between transcription factors
and their target genes and those between proteins, have
also recently been found in integrated cellular networks of
transcription regulation and protein–protein interactions
(Yeger-Lotem and Margalit 2003; Yeger-Lotem et al. 2004).

Understanding the functionality of these network motifs
can help elucidate the design principle and provide insight
into the behavior of regulatory networks. Previous work in
transcriptional regulatory networks of several species has
discovered that each motif has a specified structure and
capacity to perform specific information-processing functions (Alon 2007).
Gene expression is under tight regulation at many levels
(Shimoni et al. 2007). In the past, it was widely recognized
that the regulation of gene expression is a task of regulatory
proteins in all organisms. Thus, most research focused
mainly on transcriptional and post-translational regulations.
However, recent studies have implicated that microRNAs
(miRNAs), a family of about 22-nucleotide small noncoding
RNAs that regulate stability or translation of mRNA transcripts at the post-transcriptional level, may play crucial
roles in modulating almost all cellular processes ranging
from development and metabolism to apoptosis, signaling
pathways, and diseases such as cancer (Ambros 2004;
Bushati and Cohen 2007; Stefani and Slack 2008). As posttranscriptional gene suppressors, miRNAs regulate gene
expression by base pairing to target mRNA molecules at
conserved sites in the 30 untranslated regions of the mRNAs,
ultimately leading to a reduction in the levels of protein
encoded by the target mRNAs (Filipowicz et al. 2008).
Extensive evidence suggests that this suppression can
occur by either translational repression or mRNA cleavage
(Filipowicz et al. 2008; Bartel 2004; Valencia-Sanchez
et al. 2006; Guo et al. 2010). In the former, miRNAs act as
catalytic factors, preventing the initiation of translation,
suppressing the production of proteins. In the latter, miRNAs act in a non-catalytic fashion, leading to the degradation of the target mRNA and the miRNA itself (Wang and
Raghavachari 2011). Through either mechanism, miRNAs
can keep gene products at extremely low copy numbers.
The regulatory roles of miRNAs have been a subject of
research for the last several years, both experimentally and
theoretically (Shimoni et al. 2007; Wang and Raghavachari
2011; Levine et al. 2007; Levine and Hwa 2008; Mehta
et al. 2008; Osella et al. 2011; Mitarai et al. 2009; Bumgarner et al. 2009; Iliopoulos et al. 2009). Although some
of the miRNAs have been well studied, the mechanisms of
various functions and biological significance of miRNAs
are still not well understood (Bumgarner et al. 2009; Iliopoulos et al. 2009; Tsang et al. 2007; Shalgi et al. 2007; Re
et al. 2009; Martinez et al. 2008; Martinez and Walhout
2009; Yu et al. 2008; Inui et al. 2010; Ivey and Srivastava
2010; Johnston et al. 2005; Kim 2007; Fazi 2005; Juan et al.
2009; Bracken 2008; Li and Carthew 2005; Visvanathan
et al. 2007; Xu et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2009; Pospisil 2011).
Recently several studies have shown that the transcriptional regulation by transcription factors (TFs) and posttranscriptional regulation by miRNAs are often highly

coordinated (Shimoni et al. 2007; Tsang et al. 2007; Shalgi
et al. 2007; Re et al. 2009; Martinez et al. 2008; Martinez
and Walhout 2009; Yu et al. 2008; Inui et al. 2010; Ivey and
Srivastava 2010). Of particular relevance is the accumulating evidence that the interplay of miRNAs and transcriptional regulators such as activators and repressors regulates
key developmental events and cell fate decisions (Johnston
et al. 2005; Kim 2007; Fazi 2005; Juan et al. 2009; Bracken
2008; Li and Carthew 2005; Visvanathan et al. 2007; Xu
et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2009; Pospisil 2011). These observations imply that the existence of considerable crosstalk
between the transcriptional and post-transcriptional layers.
Therefore, miRNA functions can be fully understood only by
addressing TF and miRNA regulatory interactions together
in ‘‘mixed’’ networks. Interestingly, recently computational
and experimental studies have identified several recurrent
network motifs contained in these mixed networks (Shimoni
et al. 2007; Tsang et al. 2007; Shalgi et al. 2007; Re et al.
2009; Martinez et al. 2008; Martinez and Walhout 2009; Yu
et al. 2008; Inui et al. 2010; Ivey and Srivastava 2010), such
as miRNA-mediated single-input modules in which an
miRNA regulates a group of target genes (Shimoni et al.
2007), and miRNA-mediated feedback and feed-forward
loops (Tsang et al. 2007; Shalgi et al. 2007; Re et al. 2009;
Martinez et al. 2008), as has been observed in transcriptional
regulation networks of bacteria and yeast (Shen-Orr et al.
2002; Lee 2002). The simplest motif is a two-node miRNAmediated double negative feedback loop (MDNFL) in which
a TF suppresses an miRNA and the TF itself is negatively
regulated by the miRNA.
In this paper, we focus on this particular network motif,
the MDNFL. The major motivation for this studying is that
this specific motif has been reported in several recent
experimental studies (Fazi 2005; Juan et al. 2009; Bracken
2008; Li and Carthew 2005; Visvanathan et al. 2007; Xu
et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2009; Pospisil 2011). For example,
in human hematopoietic cells, NFI-A and miR-233 function
in a double negative feedback loop to control granulocytic
differentiation (Fazi 2005; Fig. 1a). In undifferentiated
cells, miR-233 level is low and NFI-A level is high; however, upon retinoic acid signaling, miR-233 level increases
due to the activation by the TF C/EBPa and NFI-A is then
repressed, facilitating the differentiation to the myeloid
lineage. This double negative feedback loop ensures
mutually exclusive expression of miR-233 and NFI-A,
thereby generating a bistable system, i.e., undifferentiated
versus differentiated hematopoietic cells (Fazi 2005).
Similarly, during skeletal muscle development, Ezh2 and
miR-214 form a double negative feedback loop to regulate
skeletal muscle cell differentiation (Juan et al. 2009;
Fig. 1b). In undifferentiated myoblasts, Ezh2 is highly
expressed and represses miR-214. Upon differentiation,
MyoD/myogenin expression is activated and promotes

epithelial-mesenchymal transition during embryological development
(Bracken 2008). d MDNFL promotes photoreceptor differentiation in
the Drosophila eye (Li and Carthew 2005). e MDNFL contributes to a
rapid and efficient transition of cellular phenotypes between neural
progenitors and post-mitotic neurons during embryonic central
nervous system development (Visvanathan et al. 2007). f MDNFL
contributes to irreversible silencing of self-renewal and pluripotency
programs upon initiation of embryonic stem cell differentiation (Xu
et al. 2009). g MDNFL controls the balance between neural stem cell
proliferation and differentiation (Zhao et al. 2009). h MDNFL

The solid and dotted lines denote transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations, respectively

transcription of miR-214, which in turn negatively regulates
Ezh2 by inhibiting translation of its mRNA and thus reducing
Ezh2 expression, ensuring complete differentiation of skeletal
muscle cells (Juan et al. 2009). Moreover, in embryologic
development, a double negative feedback loop between
ZEB1-SIP1 and the miRNA-200 family controls epithelialmesenchymal transition (Bracken 2008; Fig. 1c). In epithelial
cells, a stable state is maintained by a high miR-200 level,
which inhibits ZEB1/SIP1 and hence increases the expression
of ZEB-repressed epithelial genes. The transition to a mesenchymal state can be induced by TGF-h, which increases the
ZEB1-SIP1 level. A high ZEB1-SIP1 level in turn instigates
and maintains a mesenchymal state through the repression of
miR-200 by ZEB1-SIP1 (Bracken 2008). Likewise, in Drosophila eye development, the reciprocal repression between
miR-7 and Yan ensures their mutually exclusive expression
pattern: Yan is expressed in progenitor cells and miR-7 is
expressed in photoreceptor cells (Li and Carthew 2005;
Fig. 1d). The transition can be induced by the EGFR signaling, which transiently triggers Yan degradation. A decrease in
Yan level relieves miR-7 from transcriptional repression,
subsequently leading to the depletion of Yan in photoreceptor
cells (Li and Carthew 2005). Moreover, during embryonic
central nervous system development, a double negative
feedback loop between the anti-neural REST/SCP1 and proneural miR-124 pathways contributes to a rapid and efficient
transition of cellular phenotypes between neural progenitors

419

and post-mitotic neurons (Visvanathan et al. 2007; Fig. 1e).
In nonneuronal cells including neural progenitors, the REST/
SCP1 complex transcriptionally represses expression of miR124 and other neuronal genes. As the REST level decreases
during neurogenesis, miR-124 expression is derepressed, and
subsequently, miR-124 post-transcriptionally suppresses
multiple anti-neural factors including SCP1, resulting in further inhibition of the anti-neural pathway by REST/SCP1.
This regulatory loop may represent key mechanisms to sense
the intricate balance between proneural and anti-neural cues
during development, to coordinate robust neuronal gene
expression, and to confer neuronal identity in a timely manner
(Visvanathan et al. 2007). In addition, upon initiation of
embryonic stem cell differentiation, reciprocal inhibition
of miR-145 and OCT4 contributes to irreversible silencing of
self-renewal and pluripotency programs (Xu et al. 2009;
Fig. 1f). Similar MDNFL motifs are also found in regulating
the balance between neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation (Zhao et al. 2009; Fig. 1g), and PU.1-directed
macrophage differentiation (Pospisil 2011; Fig. 1h). These
experimental observations imply that this basic module may
function as a bistable switch to regulate cell fate decisions
such as differentiation during development. Actually, it has
been shown that double negative feedback loops can act as
bistable switches both experimentally and theoretically
(Gardner et al. 2000; Ferrell 2002; Ferrell and Xiong 2001;
Chatterjee et al. 2008). However, it is not clear whether the
MDNFL can behave as a bistable switch. It is also not known
the possible functions and biological significance of the
miRNA in the MDNFL.
To address these questions, we propose a general computational model for the MDNFL based on biochemical
regulations and explore its dynamics by using bifurcation
analysis. Our results show that the MDNFL can indeed
behave as a bistable switch. This functional feature is in
agreement with experimental observations of the widespread appearance of miRNAs in fate decisions during
development. Importantly, it is found that under the interplay of a TF and an miRNA, the MDNFL model can
behave as switches for wide ranges of parameters even
without cooperative binding of the TF. It thus provides a
novel mechanism to induce bistability through this combinatorial regulation even without cooperativity in the
regulation. In addition, we also investigate how extrinsic
noise affects dynamic behavior of the MDNFL. Interestingly, it is found that when the MDNFL is in the bistable
region, the MDNFL system can switch from one steady
state to the other and meanwhile the production of either
miRNA or protein is amplified significantly by choosing
the appropriate extrinsic noise source. From an engineering
perspective, this noise-based switch and amplifier for gene
expression is very easy to control because carefully tuning
noise strength is not needed.

In this paper, we are mainly interested in analyzing the
dynamics of the MDNFL and see what can be achieved in
the simplest setting. Thus, different cellular compartments
and separate concentrations for the nucleus and cytoplasm
are not considered and biochemical regulations are modeled by simple rate equations. The proposed MDNFL
model is depicted schematically in Fig. 2. It involves two
genes ga, gs, their corresponding transcripts, mRNA,
miRNA, and a protein A encoded by ga. The protein
A regulates transcription of gene gs and the miRNA base
pairs with the mRNA to forms the complex C.
Extensive evidences suggest that the mechanisms of
microRNA-mediated gene regulation can be translational
repression or destabilization of its target mRNAs (ValenciaSanchez et al. 2006), i.e., miRNAs can either decrease the
rate of translation or increase the degradation of its target
mRNAs. Here, we choose to model the effect of miRNA
regulation by taking the degradation rate of the target
mRNA as a function of miRNA concentration. However,
we note that the alternative choice of a translation rate of
the target mRNAs as a function of miRNA concentration
does not qualitatively alter the results below. The time
evolution of the concentrations of the species in the
MDNFL can be described by the following four deterministic rate equations:

dt

ð1Þ

d½Ms 
¼ kf ½gs  þ kb ½gs : A  ds ½Ms   c½Ma ½Ms ;

ð2Þ

In the above equations, [gs], [gs : A ], [Ms], [Ma], and
[A], respectively, denote the concentration of free gene
gs, gene gs with A bound to its promoter, miRNA, mRNA,
and protein A. As in Francois and Hakim (2005), here the
cellular volume is taken as volume unit and thus the
concentrations and the number of the species are
equivalent. It is assumed that there is only a single copy
of gene gs in the cell, i.e., [gs] ? [gs : A] = 1 mol.
Therefore, [gs] can also represent the probability that gene
gs is free without A bound to its promoter. Particularly, A
proteins bind to the promoter of gene gs at a rate kh and
when bound they dissociate at a rate k-h. The miRNA Ms
is transcribed at a rate kb when A binds to gene gs or at a
rate kf otherwise. Thus, kb [ kf corresponds to
transcriptional activation by protein A and kb \ kf to
transcriptional repression, which will be focused on in this
paper. Since regulation of gene ga is not considered, it is
simply assumed that mRNA Ma is produced at a given
basal rate ka. The mRNA Ma is translated into protein A at
a rate kA. ds, dm, and dA are the degradation rates for
Ms, Ma, and A, respectively. c is the base pairing rate of
the miRNA with the mRNA. Here we assume that the base
pairing is irreversible, consistent with the fact that the
complex formed by miRNA and mRNA is extremely
stable or rapidly degraded, and thus the complex needs not
to be treated as a dynamical variable. Throughout this
paper except if otherwise stated, we fix parameters as
follows: kh ¼ 0:04 min1 ; kh ¼ 0:001 mol1 min1 ; ka ¼
4 molmin1 ; kf ¼ 35 mol min1 ; kb ¼ 2 mol min1 ; kA ¼
1 min1 ; ds ¼ 0:006 min1 ; dm ¼ 0:04 min1 ; dA ¼ 0:01
min1 ; and c ¼ 0:02 mol1 min1 : In general, the range
of each parameter value above is rather wide and here it is
chosen to be typical in vivo value. It should be noted that
all the above parameters were either directly taken from
literature or estimated based upon analogous biological
systems (Shimoni et al. 2007; Levine et al. 2007; Levine
and Hwa 2008; Francois and Hakim 2005; Khanin and
Vinciotti 2008; Aguda et al. 2008).
Steady states, bistable switches, and one-way switches
To probe the dynamics of the MDNFL, we first investigate
how the steady-state value of [A] changes as a function of
the different parameters in Eqs.(1)–(4) by performing
bifurcation analysis. In the steady state, the rates of change

appropriate parameter regime. Figure 3a shows the bifurcation diagram of system (1)–(4) as a function of the free gs
promoter transcription rate kf. The two saddle-node bifurcation points SN1 ðkf  11:828 mol min1 Þ and SN2 ðkf 
67:799 mol min1 Þ enclose a bistable region. For any kf within
this region, the system has two stable equilibria and one
unstable equilibrium, which are represented by solid and dashdotted lines, respectively. The two stable equilibria in the bistable region correspond to low and high values of
[A], respectively. For convenience, we denote the low/high
protein concentration as the off/on state. It can be seen that a
region of bistability separates two regions of monostability,
bistability exhibits only for intermediate kf values. The two
stable state branches monotonically decrease with kf because
the miRNA concentration increases with kf and thus the
unpaired mRNA concentration decreases and further the
production of the protein is reduced. At a specific value of kf in
the bistable region, the choice between the stable equilibria is
history-dependent, i.e., the final state depends on initial

conditions (Ferrell 2002). If the value of kf is initially small,
the system ends up in the on state. As kf increases along the
upper stable branch, A remains to be in the on state until the
bifurcation point SN2 is reached. When kf is further increased,
the on state vanishes, and the system moves towards the lower
stable branch, corresponding to the off state. Then, if we
decrease kf, the system proceeds along the lower stable branch
until SN1 is reached and another transition occurs, which
brings the system back to the upper stable branch, an on state.
The system therefore exhibits some hysteresis. Hysteresis is a
property of bistable systems and of the potential importance in
biological switching. First, it reduces the probability that a
switch will repeatedly flip back and forth between two states
when the bifurcation parameter is hovering near its threshold
value, thereby providing an unambiguous threshold switching
mechanism and buffering against the noise (Ferrell and Xiong
2001). Second, it provides a potential mechanism for biochemical memory (Zhang et al. 2007). During the maturation
of Xenopus oocyte, for example, the p42 MAPK/Cdc2 system
can keep a long-term memory of a transient differentiation
stimulus (Xiong and Ferrell 2003). There are now several
known systems in which bistability and hysteresis have been
observed experimentally (Gardner et al. 2000; Xiong and
Ferrell 2003; Acar et al. 2005; Ozbudak et al. 2004; Sha et al.
2003; Pomerening et al. 2003).
Biologically speaking, the above results indicate that
when the free transcription rate of the miRNA lies outside
the region enclosed by the two saddle-node bifurcation
points, a smaller/larger free transcription rate will lead to a
higher/lower protein concentration. When the free transcription rate lies in the region, however, a smaller/larger
free transcription rate may lead to a lower/higher protein
concentration, depending on the initial conditions. As the
free transcription rate of the miRNA increases gradually
from a small value, the protein concentration will decrease
gradually but remain in high level until SN2 is reached,
where it switches to a low level. After that, the protein
concentration will stay in the low level unless the free
transcription rate is reduced and exceeds SN1 : This is
consistent with the experimental observations that in
human hematopoietic cells, the increase of miR-233 level
due to the activation by the TF C/EBPa upon retinoic acid
signaling, similar to the increase of the free transcription
rate, can facilitate undifferentiated hematopoietic cells
where miR-233 level is low and NFI-A level is high differentiate to the myeloid lineage (Fazi 2005; Fig. 2a), and
the experimental observations that during skeletal muscle
development, the increase of miR-214 level promoted by
MyoD/myogenin which is activated upon differentiation,
ensure undifferentiated myoblasts where Ezh2 is highly
expressed complete differentiation (Juan et al. 2009;
Fig. 2b). Similarly, as the free transcription rate decreases
gradually from a large value, the protein concentration will

occurs and the system become monostable. Then, if kb
decreases, A stays at the off state indefinitely, i.e., the transition is irreversible. Such kind of switches is termed irreversible or one-way switches (Tyson et al. 2003). The one-way
switch is an extreme manifestation of hysteresis, i.e., its lower
stable solution branches into the negative domain but is
actually eliminated due to a physically meaningful restriction.

Based on such hysteresis and irreversibility, bistable switches
can make a reliable decision in many physiological processes,
as in the yeast galactose-utilization network (Acar et al. 2005;
Ramsey 2006), the MAPK/PKC signaling network (Bhalla
and Iyengar 2001; Bhalla et al. 2002), and the p42 MAPK
cascade in Xenopus oocytes (Ferrell and Machleder 1998).

and upper thresholds increase moderately because a larger
kf is required to compromise efficiency of the mRNA level
at a larger ka in order to induce bistability. For a fixed
kf, when we increase the basal transcription rate ka, the
system undergoes a transition from a monomodal off state
to a bistable region and then to a monomodal on state. This
is consistent with the experimental observations that
increasing the ZEB1-SIP1 level activated by TGF-h, similar to increasing ka, can induce a transition from a epithelial state maintained by a high miR-200 level and a low
ZEB1-SIP1 level to a mesenchymal state where the ZEB1SIP1 level is high and the miR-200 level is low (Inui et al.
2010; Bracken 2008; Fig. 2c). The bifurcation diagram of
system (1)–(4) with kf and kA as the bifurcation parameters
is shown in Fig. 4c. It can also be seen that with increasing
kA, bistable regime becomes wider and the lower and upper
thresholds increase moderately. In addition, decreasing the
production rate kA from a large value for a fixed kf will shift
the system from a monomodal on state, across a bistable
region, to a monomodal off state. Figure 4d shows the
bifurcation diagram of system (1)–(4) with kf and c as the
bifurcation parameters. It indicates that when there is no
the negative post-transcriptional regulation, i.e., at c = 0,
the system is monostable. However, moderately increasing

The effect of parameter variations on the bistable
regime
In order to see whether the MDNFL model can behave as
switches for wide ranges of parameters, the codimension
two bifurcation diagram of system (1)–(4) is constructed
for all the important parameters to determine the range of
bistable regime. Figure 4a shows the bifurcation diagram
of system (1)–(4) with kf and kb as the bifurcation parameters. It can be seen that the region of bistability becomes
wider and the upper threshold of kf increases as kb
decreases due to the fact that a larger kf is needed to
compensate inefficiency of the miRNA level at a smaller kb
so as to produce bistability. Figure 4b illustrates the
bifurcation diagram of system (1)–(4) with kf and ka as the
bifurcation parameters. It is shown that with increasing
ka, the region of bistability becomes wider and the lower

c from zero can shift the system into bistable regime.
Therefore, the negative regulation mediated by the miRNAs can induce bistability. In addition, the region of bistability becomes wider with increasing c. A larger
miRNA-mRNA base pairing strength c drives the system to
the off sate and so enlarges the bistable parameter range.
Figure 4e shows the bifurcation diagram of system (1)–(4)
with kf and ds as the bifurcation parameters. With
increasing kf, bistability emerges, depending on the values
of ds. In addition, the bistable regime becomes narrow
while the lower and upper thresholds increase moderately
with increasing ds. For a fixed ds, when we increase kf, the
system undergoes a transition from a monomodal on state
to a bistable regime and then to a monomodal off state. The
bifurcation diagram of system (1)–(4) with kf and dm as the
bifurcation parameters is shown in Fig. 4f. Since decreasing the degradation rate of the mRNA dm has similar effect
with increasing the basal transcription rate of the mRNA
ka, the region of bistability becomes wider and the upper
threshold of kf increases as dm decreases. While the value
of dm is fixed, increasing the value of kf from zero will shift
the system from a monomodal on state, across a bistable
region, to a monomodal off state. The bifurcation diagram
of system (1)–(4) with kf and dA as the bifurcation
parameters is shown in Fig. 4g. By increasing the degradation rate of the protein dA from a small value, the transition begins with a monomodal on state to a a bistable
region then to a monomodal off state. This is consistent
with the experimental observations that the degradation of
protein Yan transiently triggered by the EGFR signalling,
similar to the increase of dA, can induce a transition from a
progenitor cell state where Yan is expressed to a photoreceptor cell sate where miR-7 is expressed (Li and Carthew
2005; Fig. 2d). The parameter k-h exhibits a similar
influence as the parameter dA. When we increase k-h, the
system undergoes a transition from a monomodal on state
to a a bistable region then to a monomodal off state, as seen
in Fig. 4h.
In summary, the above codimension two bifurcation
diagrams indicate that in the MDNFL model each parameter
can be varied individually for a wide range, while preserving
bistability. This means that the MDNFL model can behave as
switches for wide ranges of parameters. Moreover, it should
be pointed out that here we assume that the production of
miRNA, Ms, is regulated by protein A, through binding of a
single protein A to its promoter, gs, that is, without cooperative binding of the TF to its promoter. In this case, the
system is always monostable if the miRNA-mediated regulation does not exist (Ferrell and Xiong 2001; Lipshtat et al.
2006) [ also see Fig. 4d]. On the other hand, the miRNAmediated regulation, if works solely, also leads to monostability (Levine et al. 2007). Interestingly, under the
interplay of the TF and miRNA, it is found that the MDNFL

123

Cogn Neurodyn (2013) 7:417–429

model can behave as switches for wide ranges of parameters
even without cooperative binding of the TF. It thus provides
a novel mechanism to induce bistability through this combinatorial regulation even without cooperativity in the regulation, which is fundamentally distinct from the generation
of bistability by intrinsically nonlinear positive feedback
regulation, such as protein dimerization and cooperative
formation of heterodimers (Ferrell 2002; Ferrell and Xiong
2001; Zhdanov 2009; Liu et al. 2011). The evidence for use
of the MDNFL motif as switches has been reported recently,
especially on cell fate decisions (Fazi 2005; Juan et al. 2009;
Bracken 2008; Li and Carthew 2005; Visvanathan et al.
2007; Xu et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2009; Pospisil 2011). It is
hoped this novel mechanism can be realized in artificial
genetic networks in the future.

Stochastic model and noise-induced dynamics
for the MDNFL
The deterministic analysis above successfully demonstrates
how the steady-state values of the MDNFL system shift as
parameter values change. However, cellular processes at the
molecular level are inherently stochastic (Balàsi et al. 2011).
Numerous studies have revealed the importance of stochastic
or probabilistic effects in biological systems where the
number of molecules is low enough for noise to be important,
and the deterministic chemical kinetic descriptions are limited (Lipshtat et al. 2006; Hasty et al. 2000; Vilar et al. 2002;
Rao et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2007; Li and Li 2008). In
addition, noise can also have significant effects on the stability and synchronization of genetic regulatory networks as
well as neuronal networks (Shi et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2009;
Guo 2011; Wu et al. 2012). There are two sources of noise
in biological systems: intrinsic noise and extrinsic noise.
Intrinsic noise originates from discrete nature of biochemical
events such as transcription, translation, multimerization,
and protein/mRNA decay processes (Raj and van Oudenaarden
2008). On the other hand, extrinsic noise results from perturbations in the extrinsic environment or the random variations in
one or more of the externally set control parameters, such as the
rate constant of the transcription of a specific gene (Hasty et al.
2000). In addition, extrinsic and intrinsic noise often exist in
biological system simultaneously. In this section, we mainly
focus on how extrinsic noise affects the dynamic behavior of
the MDNFL. The effect of intrinsic noise on the dynamic
behavior of the MDNFL will be analyzed systematically
elsewhere.
Stochastic model for the MDNFL
As shown in Fig. 2, the two transcription rate of gene gs, kb
and kf, influence the dynamics of the MDNFL. Although

Cogn Neurodyn (2013) 7:417–429

425

the transcription is described as a single biochemical
reaction in our model, it actually consists of a complex
sequence of reactions (Hasty et al. 2000). It is natural to
assume that this part of the gene regulatory sequence is
likely to be affected by fluctuations of many internal or
external parameters, and it is interesting to study the effect
of such noise on the dynamics of the MDNFL. In order to
introduce such extrinsic noise into system (1)–(4), we adapt
an approach in the spirit of Ref. (Hasty et al. 2000). We
vary the transcription rates by allowing the parameters kb
and kf in system (1)–(4) to vary stochastically, that is, kb !
kb þ n1 ðtÞ and kf ! kf þ n2 ðtÞ: In such a manner, we
obtain the following stochastic model:
d½gs 
¼ kh ½gs : A  kh ½gs ½A;
ð5Þ
dt
d½Ms 
¼ kf ½gs  þ kb ½gs : A  ds ½Ms   c½Ma ½Ms  þ n1 ðtÞ½gs

where n1(t) and n2(t) are random terms with zero means
hn1 ðtÞi ¼ 0 and hn2 ðtÞi ¼ 0: In order to encapsulate rapid
random fluctuations, we make the standard requirement
that the autocorrelation be ‘‘d-correlated’’, i.e., the statistics
of ni(t) are such that hni ðtÞnj ðt0 Þi ¼ 2Ddij dðt  t0 Þ; where dij
is the Kronecker delta, d(t - t0 ) is the Dirac function and D
is the constant that characterizes the strength of the perturbation. The above stochastic model is numerically
simulated using the Euler–Maruyama scheme with the
integration time step Dt ¼ 0:0001 (Higham 2001).
Noise-induced switching and amplifying
To obtain the qualitative effect of the external noises on the
dynamics of system (1)–(4), we first use the bifurcation
diagram to anticipate the effect of fluctuations allowed in
the transcription rates. For the deterministic system, the
steady-state values of the concentration of protein A and
miRNA Ms for different values of parameter kb are shown
in Fig. 5a and b. It can be seen that the system undergoes a
saddle-node bifurcation at kb  2:635 mol min1 : For the
values of kb larger than the saddle-node bifurcation point,
the system has one unique stable equilibrium with low A
and high Ms concentrations, whereas for other values of
kb, the system has three equilibria: one is unstable and the
other two stable, where one stable equilibrium corresponds
to low A and high Ms concentrations, and the other corresponds to high A and low Ms concentrations. In the absence

of noise, the concentrations of protein A and miRNA Ms
will converge to one of the two stable equilibria completely
determined by the initial state of the system. A comparison
of Fig. 5a and b shows that the upper stable branch in
Fig. 5a is steep, while the lower stable branch in Fig. 5b is
flat. Therefore, we can anticipate that when the system is in
the bistable region and has high A and low Ms concentrations, if the parameter kb varies, the variations in the concentration of protein A will be notably large, while the
fluctuations in the concentrations of miRNA Ms will be
small. If the system lies in the other stable equilibrium with
low A and high Ms concentrations, however, only a mild
change in both the concentrations of A and Ms takes place
due to the flat lower stable branch in Fig. 5a and the flat
upper stable branch in Fig. 5b.
In order to verify the above observation quantitatively,
we next incorporate extrinsic noise to make kb stochastically vary and investigate the temporal behavior of the
system under the fluctuations. We simulated the stochastic
model for the MDNFL [Eqs. (5)–(8)] with a large noise
intensity, D = 0.75. Initially, we fix the parameter value
kb ¼ 2:6 mol min1 ; as indicated by a broken vertical line
in Fig. 5a, such that the system is in the bistable region.
The simulation results beginning with the concentration of
protein A equal to its upper value of approximately 2,000
and miRNA Ms concentration about 0 are presented in
Fig. 5c and d. At first, the fluctuations in the concentration
of protein A are quite large while the concentration of
miRNA Ms is nearly unchanged as we expected. Then, at
around 5,500 min, the concentration of A quickly drops to
the lower value. Meanwhile, the concentration of Ms
quickly jumps to its upper value and remains in there with
quite small variations, as anticipated. This phenomenon
indicates that the extrinsic noise introduced into the transcription rate is sufficient to induce the system to switch
from one stable state to the other by crossing the unstable
state. When the number of miRNA Ms is randomly fluctuated to a comparable value with that of mRNA Ma, most
of the mRNA molecules are expected to base pair rapidly
with the miRNA molecules and degraded, which will result
in a low expression of protein A and thus leave the gene gs
unregulated. In this case, the concentration of miRNA Ms
will soon build up to a rather high values if kf is large
enough, i.e., the transition occurs.
On the other hand, a large fluctuation in the concentration of protein A before the switching implies that the
amount of the protein is quite sensitive to the variation in
the parameter kb if much more protein A exists in the
system than miRNA Ms. But after the fast transition occurs
at around 5,500 min, flat curves in both Fig. 5c and d
means that the other steady state is nearly unaffected by the
fluctuations in the value of kb and thus is impossible to
switch back unless noise intensity increases. This suggests

123

426

that dynamic behavior of the MDNFL can be either sensitive or robust to the same perturbation affecting kb
depending on the specific state at which the MDNFL initially stays (Stelling et al. 2004), and under such perturbation with large enough strength, the MDNFL is very
likely to switch to or remain in the robust state with low A
and high Ms concentrations. It is also noticed that in the fast
transition, the concentration of miRNA Ms increases
abruptly by over three orders of magnitude in a very short
time if kf is large enough. This character suggests that the
extrinsic noise affecting kb might be used to amplify
miRNA Ms’s production.
Similar results can be obtained for the extrinsic noise
affecting kf when the value of the parameter kf is initially
set to 12 mol min1 except that the state with high A and
low Ms concentrations that is sensitive to the fluctuations in
kb discussed above is robust to the random variation of
kf, and the other state with low A and high Ms concentrations which is robust to the fluctuations in kb is sensitive to
the random variation of kf, as suggested in Fig. 2a. As a
result, if the MDNFL is affected by the perturbation
affecting kf, contrary to the above result, the MDNFL is
very likely to switch to or remain in the state with high
A and low Ms concentrations. Likewise, the concentration
of protein A may increase significantly during the switching process. This interesting feature of the MDNFL allows
us to obtain the desired state switch and amplifying in the
MDNFL easily by choosing the appropriate extrinsic noise
source. From an engineering perspective, this character
makes this type of switch easy to control because accurately tuning the strength and timing of noise has been done
in Hasty et al. (2000) is not needed here.

Discussion and conclusion
The importance of post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs
has recently been recognized in diverse biological processes in
animals and plants (Ambros 2004; Bushati and Cohen 2007;
Stefani and Slack 2008; Inui et al. 2010; Ivey and Srivastava
2010). Moreover their profiles are altered in several human
diseases (Alvarez-Garcia and Miska 2005; Esquela-Kerscher
and Slack 2006), making miRNAs a major focus of research in
nowadays molecular biology. Recently, possible functions
and biological significance of miRNAs have been the subject
of both experimental and theoretical studies (Shimoni et al.
2007; Wang and Raghavachari 2011; Levine et al. 2007;
Levine and Hwa 2008; Mehta et al. 2008; Osella et al. 2011;
Mitarai et al. 2009; Bumgarner et al. 2009; Iliopoulos et al.
2009). Some special functional features of miRNAs have
been indicated by mathematical modeling and dynamical
simulations, e.g., a tunable threshold-linear expression

123

Cogn Neurodyn (2013) 7:417–429

pattern and repression of fluctuation in the silence regime
(Levine et al. 2007; Levine and Hwa 2008), better than
TF-based regulation at filtering input noise but suffers
higher intrinsic noise arising from transcriptional bursting
(Mehta et al. 2008), and fine-tuning of a target protein
level and an efficient noise control (Osella et al. 2011).
However, most of the previous works focus only on how
miRNAs post-transcriptionally regulate the target protein
levels, work solely, and induce monostability. Recently,
several double negative feedback loops involving miRNAs
and TFs have been found experimentally in a variety of
organisms (Martinez et al. 2008; Johnston et al. 2005; Kim
2007; Fazi 2005; Juan et al. 2009; Bracken 2008; Li and
Carthew 2005; Visvanathan et al. 2007; Xu et al. 2009;
Zhao et al. 2009; Pospisil 2011). It has been shown that
such composite double negative feedback loop (MDNFL)
occurs frequently, and hence constitutes a network motif
(Tsang et al. 2007; Martinez and Walhout 2009). To our
knowledge, the issue about possible functions of this basic
motif and the effects of combinational regulation by TFs
and miRNAs have not yet been well addressed. To better
understand the dynamical properties of this basic motif, we
have presented a general computational model for the
MDNFL and explored its dynamics by using bifurcation
analysis. Our results show that there exist wide ranges of
parameters where the MDNFL can behave as switches.
These functional features are consistent with the widespread appearance of miRNAs in fate decisions such as
differentiation during development. In addition, positive
feedback and cooperativity in the regulation of gene
expression are generally considered to be necessary for
obtaining bistable expression states (Ferrell and Xiong
2001; Lipshtat et al. 2006). Interestingly, here it is found
that under the combinatorial regulation by a TF and an
miRNA, the MDNFL model can behave as switches for
wide ranges of parameters even without cooperative
binding of the TF. It thus provides a novel mechanism to
induce bistability through this combinatorial regulation
even without cooperativity in the regulation. We hope this
mechanism can be realized in artificial genetic networks in
the future.
On the other hand, cellular processes at the molecular
level are inherently stochastic (Balàsi et al. 2011). The
origin of stochasticity can be attributed to internal and
external noises. It is well known that noise can have great
impacts on biological systems’ dynamical properties
(Lipshtat et al. 2006; Hasty et al. 2000; Vilar et al. 2002;
Rao et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2007; Li and Li 2008), for
example, noise can induce sustained stochastic oscillation
even though the corresponding deterministic system only
yields steady state (Li and Li 2008). In this paper, we have
also studied the effect of extrinsic noise on the dynamic
behavior of the MDNFL. It is found that if the noise is

Cogn Neurodyn (2013) 7:417–429

considered, the MDNFL system can generate some different phenomena not observed in the corresponding
deterministic model. More specifically, when the MDNFL
system is in the bistable region, extrinsic noise fluctuating
the two transcription rates of the miRNAs gene can induce
the system quickly switch from one steady state to the
other. In addition, any one of the two steady states is robust
to one type of the two different extrinsic noises but sensitive to the other. This feature makes this type of switch
easy to control because the requirement of carefully tuning
noise strength is not considered. Moreover, during the
transition process, the concentration of the miRNA (or the
protein) is quite low before the switch can be amplified
significantly.
The control of cellular functions through the design and
manipulation of gene regulatory networks is an intriguing
perspective in applications (Wang et al. 2007). Current gene
therapy techniques are limited in that transfected genes are
typically either in an ‘‘on’’ or ‘‘off’’ state (Hasty et al. 2000).
For the effective treatment of many diseases, however, the
expression of a transfected gene needs to be regulated in a
systematic fashion. Thus, the development of extrinsically
controllable noise-based switches and amplifiers for gene
expression could have significant clinical implications and the
results in this paper suggest that the MDNFL might be quite
useful for that. To make this feature of MDNFL clinically
applicable, it is important to look for an appropriate noise
source. Sets of chemical reactions that affect the transcription
of gene gs might be used as the noise input of this switch.
Moreover, it has recently been shown that manipulation of
miRNAs is readily achievable in vivo and thus holds exciting
promise for potential therapeutic applications for diseases
associated miRNAs (krützfelt 2005; Elmèn 2008).
It has been widely recognized that a complicated living
organism cannot be fully understood by merely analyzing
individual components, and that interactions of those components or biomolecular networks in terms of structures and
dynamics are ultimately responsible for an organism’s form,
rhythms, and functions (Wang et al. 2008). But the intrinsic
complexity of biomolecular networks inhibits us to understand them as a whole. Instead, researchers turn to study the
building block, or motif, of these networks. Elucidating these
motifs’ dynamics and functions would shed light on the whole
networks’ behaviors. Computational models based on experimental data have been proven to be quite useful to solve these
problems (Alon 2007). In this paper, we have proposed a
simple computational model for the miRNA-mediated double
negative feedback loop (MDNFL) motif and studied its
functional characteristic motivated by this motif appears in
regulation fate decisions in a variety of organisms (Martinez
et al. 2008; Johnston et al. 2005; Kim 2007; Fazi 2005; Juan
et al. 2009; Bracken 2008; Li and Carthew 2005; Visvanathan
et al. 2007; Xu et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2009; Pospisil 2011).

427

Besides the minimal architecture discussed here, miRNAmediated network motifs with other architectures can be
similarly analyzed, such as miRNA-mediated feed-forward
loops (Tsang et al. 2007; Shalgi et al. 2007; Re et al. 2009). It
is expected that the insight gained from the study of these
simple motifs could provide a basis for investigation of more
complex networks assembled by simple building blocks. A
more clear understanding of the miRNA-mediated motifs is
also important for bio-engineering or artificial control of
specified components, interactions, and even network functions. It is hoped that the results presented here could provide a
new view on how gene expression is regulated and further
guidance for experiments.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that a plausible method
whereby a system may be experimentally probed for bistability has been proposed in (Hasty et al. 2000). The
main idea is that in a bistable system, the threshold value of
the control parameter required for the system to be switched from off to on state is different from that for transitioning in the reverse direction [also see Fig. 2]. Since the
degradation parameter dA is easier to manipulate externally
(Hasty et al. 2000), according to the suggestion given in
(Hasty et al. 2000), one can perform an experiment for the
MDNFL system by slowly increasing the degradation rate
dA from a low initial value to see whether the concentration
of protein A can abruptly jump to a lower value at some
moment after a slow decrease. If so, one then reverses the
direction of the experiment to observe whether the concentration of protein A can suddenly switch to a higher
value at some point after a slow increase. If it occurs and
the downward threshold value differs from that of the
upward, then one can conclude that the MDNFL system is
a bistable system. Similar methods have been used to probe
for bistability in previous experimental studies (Gardner
et al. 2000; Xiong and Ferrell 2003; Ozbudak et al. 2004).
In addition, it should be pointed out that simple genetic
network motifs are always embedded in a larger and more
complex network, under some circumstances, it thus might
be not easy for us to observe in vivo the phenomena predicted here due to the fact that the MDNFL no longer
functions independently, but as pointed out in (Alon 2007)
in many cases the functions can be preserved.
