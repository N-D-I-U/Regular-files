europathological conditions including stroke, Alzheimer’s
disease, and Parkinson’s disease are associated with excitotoxic and oxidative stress. Transcriptional increases of neuroprotective genes, including antiapoptotic factors and scavengers
of reactive oxygen species (ROS), are an important strategy for
neuroprotection. Thus, understanding how neuroprotective gene
programs are controlled at the transcriptional level is of considerable importance and may contribute to the identiﬁcation of therapeutic strategies of disorders associated with neurodegeneration.
cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor that is activated in response to stressful stimuli such as
hypoxia, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and ischemia (1). Evidence
from loss-of-function and other types of experiments shows that
CREB plays an important role in neuronal survival (2–5) and neuroprotection (6). It is also well established that CREB is required for
acquisition of ischemic tolerance, an endogenous neuroprotective
mechanism whereby prior exposure to brief ischemia produces resilience to subsequent normally injurious ischemia (7, 8).
Despite the well-documented neuroprotective effect of CREB,
only little is known of how CREB mediates this activity and only
few directly regulated neuroprotective target genes have been
identiﬁed (9–13). In addition to target genes that are directly
neuroprotective, CREB-induced transcription factors or cofactors
may also contribute to neuron survival by regulating downstream
gene batteries controlled by elevated cAMP levels in a transcription factor cascade initiated by activated CREB. Indeed, CREB
induces the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1a (PGC-1α), an important regulator
of ROS-detoxifying enzyme gene expression (14). However, how
CREB mediates neuroprotective gene cascades via the induction
of additional transcriptional regulators remains unexplored.
The NR4A orphan nuclear receptor (NR) family of transcription
factors is rapidly and strongly up-regulated after stressful insults to
the CNS (15–18). NR4A proteins consist of NR4A1 (NGFI-B),
NR4A2 (Nurr1), and NR4A3 (Nor-1). Structural studies of the
NR4A2 ligand-binding domain have shown that these receptors

www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1007088107

lack a ligand-binding pocket and appear to function as ligandindependent transcription factors (19). However, NR4A1 and
NR4A2 can also form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor
(RXR) and they can activate gene expression in response to RXR
ligands including 9-cis retinoic acid (20) and docosahexaenoic
acid (21).
Because these proteins do not bind ligands, NR4A-regulated
genes may be regulated by posttranslational modiﬁcation of the
NR4A proteins or altered NR4A gene expression. Indeed, the expression of NR4A genes can be induced by a wide range of physiological signals such as membrane depolarization and growth
factors (22). Notably, NR4A receptors are robustly induced in the
CNS by pathological stimuli such as ischemia (17, 18), seizures
(16), and focal brain injury (15). These stimuli are also associated
with CREB activation. Recently, using genome-wide expression
proﬁling in mice lacking CREB in the forebrain, NR4A1 and
NR4A2 were identiﬁed as two of the few genes that require CREB
for their induction in the hippocampus after administration of the
glutamate analog kainic acid (23). However, the functional consequences of stress-induced NR4A expression in neurons have
remained unknown.
Considering their rapid induction by stimuli converging on
CREB activation in neurons, we wished to investigate if NR4A
receptors might be downstream mediators of the neuroprotective
effects of CREB. We used experiments in cultured neurons to
show that NR4A proteins are neuroprotective when cells are exposed to either excitotoxic or oxidative stress. Moreover, we have
shown that NR4A receptors regulate neuroprotective genes and
we investigated the response to excitotoxicity in vivo in NR4A
gene-deﬁcient mice. Collectively, our results identify NR4A nuclear receptors as essential transcription factors in a neuron survival program downstream of CREB and indicate that they may be
suitable targets for intervention in neurodegenerative disease.

NEUROSCIENCE

Induced expression of neuroprotective genes is essential for maintaining neuronal integrity after stressful insults to the brain. Here
we show that NR4A nuclear orphan receptors are induced after
excitotoxic and oxidative stress in neurons, up-regulate neuroprotective genes, and increase neuronal survival. Moreover, we
show that NR4A proteins are induced by cAMP response element
binding protein (CREB) in neurons exposed to stressful insults and
that they function as mediators of CREB-induced neuronal survival.
Animals with null mutations in three of six NR4A alleles show increased oxidative damage, blunted induction of neuroprotective
genes, and increased vulnerability in the hippocampus after treatment with kainic acid. We also demonstrate that NR4A and the
transcriptional coactivator PGC-1α independently regulate distinct
CREB-dependent neuroprotective gene programs. These data identify NR4A nuclear orphan receptors as essential mediators of neuroprotection after exposure to neuropathological stress.

with rolipram, a type IV phosphodiesterase that induces CREB
phosphorylation (p-CREB) and confers neuroprotection from various types of stress (25, 26) (Fig. 1A). CREB function was analyzed
by a decoy strategy whereby cultured neurons were transfected with
DNA oligos containing the CREB DNA responsive element (CRE)
(SI Appendix, Fig. S2). The CRE decoy titrates CREB away from
its natural promoter targets and shows if an observed effect is
CREB dependent. As expected, rolipram preconditioning resulted
in CREB-dependent resistance to hydrogen peroxide-, ionomycin-,
and glutamate-induced toxicity (Fig. 1B).
NR4A receptors are induced as downstream CREB targets in
rolipram-treated neurons as shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S3 A and B.
In addition, neuropathological stress (ionomycin and hydrogen
peroxide) known to induce CREB also induced CREB-dependent
NR4A mRNA and protein (SI Appendix, Fig. S3D). Moreover, we
conﬁrmed the ability of CREB to directly regulate NR4A2 mRNA

Fig. 1. NR4A-mediated neuroprotection. (A and B) MACS-sorted neurons
were transfected with the indicated oligos for 5 h, received fresh medium
for 19 h, and were then treated with rolipram or DMSO for 1 h and subsequently stressed with the indicated concentrations of ionomycin, H2O2, or
glutamate for 18 h. Cell survival was assayed by adding cell titer reagent and
measuring the absorbance at 490 nm. Error bars indicate SD, n = 9; *signiﬁcant at P < 0.05; **signiﬁcant at P < 0.01. (C) MACS-sorted neurons

values obtained with the different NR4A lentiviruses were normalized to the
eGFP lentivirus values. Error bars indicate SD, n = 5.

expression in neural cells by direct promoter binding and activation in transfected neural c17.2 cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). In
conclusion, NR4A receptors are directly and robustly regulated in
neurons in which CREB has been activated by neuronal stress (2to 8-fold) or after pharmacological treatments that increase intracellular levels of cAMP (4- to 11-fold).
We next tested if NR4A receptors mediate CREB-induced
neuroprotective effects. An oligo containing NR4A DNA binding
sites (referred to as NGFI-B response element, NBRE) was used
as a decoy to block NR4A activity (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Notably,
rolipram pretreatment resulted in enhanced survival after exposure to all three stressors, but the neuroprotective effect was signiﬁcantly reduced when neurons were transfected with NBRE
decoy (Fig. 1B). The extent of inhibition was about half of that seen
when cells were pretreated with CRE decoy (Fig. 1B). This result
suggests that the NR4A receptors mediate a signiﬁcant portion of
the rolipram-induced neuroprotection. Lentiviral vectors were
used to further investigate the involvement of NR4A receptors in
neuroprotection. Lenti-NR4A2 (L-NR4A2), but not the LentieGFP (L-eGFP)-transduced neurons, showed increased survival
from ionomycin-, glutamate-, and hydrogen peroxide-induced toxicity (Fig. 1C). Moreover, lentiviral vectors for the expression of
closely related NR4A1 and NR4A3 proteins also conferred neuroprotection (Fig. 1D). Thus, loss-of-function (by decoy blocking)
and lentiviral-mediated gain-of-function show that NR4A receptors contribute to the neuroprotection observed in CREBactivated neurons.
NR4A2 Activates Neuroprotective Gene Expression. To gain further
insight into how NR4A proteins promote survival after neuropathological stress, changes in gene expression resulting from increased NR4A expression were assessed. Sorted neurons were
transduced with either L-NR4A2 or L-eGFP (SI Appendix, Fig. S5)
and mRNA was subjected to microarray analysis. One hundred
forty-nine genes were found to be up-regulated in L-NR4A2 samples at a statistically signiﬁcant level (>1.6-fold). Thirty-nine genes
were down-regulated (>1.6-fold). Interestingly, several of the induced genes have previously been shown to promote neuronal
survival after stressful insults (Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Table S1)
Moreover, a gene list enrichment analysis showed that gene sets
associated with additional functions or pathways linked to neuroprotection are up-regulated in mRNA samples from L-NR4A2–
transduced neurons (SI Appendix, Table S2). qRT-PCR conﬁrmed
up-regulation of neuroprotective genes in mRNA samples derived
from L-NR4A2-transduced neurons. Moreover, we wished to test if
NR4A-regulated genes would also be induced in neurons treated
with 8CPT-cAMP, a treatment that activates CREB. Indeed, all
analyzed mRNAs were up-regulated ∼2-fold in neurons exposed to
8CPT-cAMP, and CRE decoy transfection lowered induced mRNA
levels (Fig. 2B). Importantly, 8CPT-cAMP-treated cells that were
transfected with NBRE decoy showed diminished expression of
neuroprotective genes by at least 50%, demonstrating that NR4A
proteins are clearly important for CREB-mediated gene activation
of these protective gene products (Fig. 2C).
CREB-Induced PGC-1α-Mediated Neuroprotection. The coactivator
PGC-1α regulates the expression of a broad set of ROS defense
genes and its promoter has been shown to be regulated by CREB
under oxidative stress (14). We wished to investigate the relationship between PGC-1α and NR4A-induced neuroprotection.
We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that both rolipram and 8CPT-cAMP treatment
of neurons resulted in induction of PGC-1α mRNA in a CREBdependent way (Fig. 3 A and B). We next used a Lenti-PGC-1α
shRNA expression vector (SI Appendix, Fig. S6) to conﬁrm that
PGC-1α mediated neuroprotection was downstream of CREB in
cultured neurons treated with rolipram. Results conﬁrmed that
PGC-1α could protect against oxidative stress, but we also found
that PGC-1α did not promote protection against excitotoxic stress

(Fig. 3C). In accordance with these results, infection of neurons
with a PGC-1α lentivirus (L-PGC-1α) conferred neuroprotection,
but only against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress
(Fig. 3D). Virus cotransduction using lentivirus vectors for both
NR4A2 and PGC-1α resulted in a very high survival (70%) after
exposure to hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3D). However, the effect was
additive rather than synergistic.
Because both NR4A2 and PGC-1α can mediate neuroprotection
from hydrogen peroxide, we determined whether they regulate
similar or distinct target genes. qRT-PCR was used to conﬁrm that
a number of previously identiﬁed PGC-1α target genes implicated
in protection from oxidative stress (14) are up-regulated after
transduction of L-PGC-1α. As seen in Fig. 4A, all analyzed target
genes were robustly activated by forced expression of PGC-1α (2- to
7-fold); however, L-NR4A2 virus transduction resulted in only
marginal up-regulation (2-fold) of one PGC-1α target (Prdx5). Reciprocally, only one of the analyzed neuroprotective NR4A2 target
genes (Sod1) was signiﬁcantly up-regulated (2-fold) by forced expression of PGC-1α (Fig. 4B). Thus, NR4A and PGC-1α appear to
mediate distinct and complementary neuroprotective pathways
because they induce distinct sets of neuroprotective gene targets.
NR4A Nuclear Receptors Protect Hippocampus Neurons Against Kainic
Acid Toxicity. Finally, the signiﬁcance of NR4A proteins in neuro-

protection was evaluated in vivo by analyzing if NR4A proteins can
confer neuroprotection to kainic acid (KA), a glutamate analogue
that is associated with excitotoxicity and oxidative stress within the
hippocampus. KA induces CREB-dependent expression of NR4A

experiments, wild-type mice or mice lacking three of six NR4A
alleles (NR4A2+/−; NR4A3−/−; here referred to as NR4Amut) were
injected with 25 mg/kg KA or saline. Three days following status
epilepticus the histology of mice was analyzed within the hippocampus. As seen in Fig. 5A, saline-treated NR4Amut mice showed
decreased cell density within the CA1 hippocampal ﬁeld, consistent
with the previous ﬁnding that NR4A3 knockout mice show a developmental decrease in neuron density within the hippocampus
(27). Importantly, in contrast to wild type, NR4mut mice showed
a signiﬁcant decrease in the number of remaining cells within the
CA1 region of the hippocampus following KA treatment (Fig. 5A).
Moreover, in KA-treated NR4mut mice, but not in wild-type controls, an increase in oxidative stress was evident from an increased
number of cells staining positive using an antibody detecting
nitrosylated tyrosine species and an increased number of degenerating neurons were detected by Fluoro-Jade staining within the
CA3 region (Fig. 5B).

Discussion
The central role of CREB in neuroprotection emphasizes the importance of understanding how it maintains neuronal integrity.
The rolipram paradigm used here to increase CREB activity and
thereby promote neuronal protection has been used before to
demonstrate how pharmacological activation of CREB before
neurological insult will alleviate later neuronal damage both
in vivo and in vitro. However, understanding how CREB regulates neuroprotection has remained largely unknown. Our results
point to a role played by NR4A proteins as key downstream
mediators of CREB-induced neuroprotection. Importantly, our
results in vivo, showing that NR4A knockout mice are more
vulnerable to kainic acid toxicity, most likely underestimate the
importance of these proteins because only three of six NR4A
alleles were targeted in these experiments.
Forced expression of NR4A2 in cultured neurons induced genes
identiﬁed in gene arrays that were also conﬁrmed targets of
rolipram-activated CREB. A considerable proportion of NR4A2activated genes have previously been associated with neuroprotection. Adcyap1 is a signaling peptide that via its receptor increases
intracellular cAMP. Thus, its activation by NR4A can likely contribute to a positive feed-forward mechanism for increased and
maintained CREB activation in exposed neurons. Moreover, it may
provide a means whereby stressed neurons may provide protection
by paracrine signaling in adjacent neuronal tissue (28, 29). Overexpression of Adm (30) and Prkaa2 (31) has been shown to confer
neuroprotection in a variety of contexts but the precise downstream
mechanisms are not well characterized. Ddx6 and zbp1 are involved
in stress granule formation and 4E-bp2 in translational arrest. These
two processes are of major importance for the protection of mRNA
from decay during conditions of cellular stress and thus cell survival
from stress (32). Abl2 (33), Sesn3 (34), and Sod1 (35) are genes
involved in ROS detoxiﬁcation, whereas c-ﬂar is an apoptosis inhibitor that prevents the formation of active caspase 8 (36). Finally,

expected, all three NR4A genes were up-regulated by KA in
hippocampus of wild-type mice, but several NR4A target genes
that were induced by KA in wild-type controls were diminished in
NR4Amut mice (Fig. 5C). PGC-1α was also induced in the hippocampus 3 d after KA injection and genetic deletion of NR4A
alleles did not affect its induction. Taken together, these results
show that NR4A-deﬁcient mice are more sensitive to neurodegeneration, presumably as a result of decreased induction of an
NR4A-dependent neuroprotective gene program.

for the in vivo neuroprotective effect of basic ﬁbroblast growth factor
(37), suggests a potential interplay between NR4A receptors and
other neuroprotective pathways. Interestingly, a gene list enrichment
analysis that identiﬁes gene sets associated with common functions
or pathways revealed that additional pathways linked to neuroprotection are up-regulated in mRNA samples from L-NR4A2transduced neurons (SI Appendix, Table S2). Notably, mTOR (38),
adrenergic (39), insulin receptor (40), and VEGF signaling pathways
(41) have been linked to neuroprotection and are signiﬁcantly
enriched in NR4A2-expressing neurons. Thus, we speculate that
NR4A promotes neuroprotection as a result of a combined effect by
mutiple genes rather than any individual NR4A target gene.
CREB is a central intracellular regulator in several signaling
pathways and inﬂuences a variety of neural processes. Pharmacological treatment by drugs such as rolipram confers diverse responses in treated neurons. Thus, therapeutic intervention
designed to target factors acting downstream of CREB may be
advantageous and confer higher precision in treatments aimed at
blocking neurodegeneration. Treatments that can increase NR4A
activity in neurons exposed to insult could be therefore be of signiﬁcant clinical relevance. Several strategies whereby NR4A activity could be increased can be envisioned. For example, NR4A
belongs to the nuclear receptor family whose members are commonly regulated by small lipophilic ligands. However, the ligandbinding domain of NR4A receptors is unconventional and lacks
a ligand-binding pocket, but two NR4A members, NR4A1 and

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. DMSO, hydrogen peroxide, ionomycin, glutamate, rolipram, and
8CPT-cAMP were purchased from Sigma. The absolute volumes of DMSO
added to the cells were minimal (<0.5%) and did not affect cell survival. The
CellTiter 96 reagent to assay cell survival was purchased from Promega and
used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Plasmids. NR4A2 (NM_013613), NR4A3 (NM_015743), NR4A1 (NM_010444),
and PGC-1α (NM_008904) cDNAs were cloned into the HIV-PGK-GFP vector
(48) after removal of the GFP cDNA. Lenti-PGC-1α shRNA was made by cloning
a shRNA against PGC-1α (49) into the pLKO.1 vector (Open Biosystems).
Cell Culture. E14.1 mouse stem cells were propagated in Cellbind culture
ﬂasks (Corning) in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2,000 units/mL LIF
(Chemicon), 10% KSR (Invitrogen), 2% FCS (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM nonessential
amino acids (Invitrogen), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), and 0.1 mM β2-

mercaptoethanol (Sigma). For differentiation, stem cells were plated on
gelatinized Cellbind T75 culture ﬂasks and incubated in the above medium
for 4 h. Thereafter, the cells were washed with PBS and grown in N2B27
differentiation medium (50) for 15 d. The medium was supplemented with
1 mM cyclopamine (Calbiochem) during the ﬁrst week.
Western Blot Analysis. Nuclear extracts were performed using the protocol
described in ref. 51. Equal amounts of extracts were loaded on 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, and blotted onto polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes (BioRad). For a list of antibodies used, see SI Appendix, SI Text.
Immunohistochemistry. Cells were ﬁxed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min
at room temperature, washed with PBS, blocked in 0.3% Triton X-100
(Sigma), 1% FCS for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated overnight
at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in block solution. For a list of antibodies used, see SI Appendix, SI Text. Slides were then washed with PBS and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies (Alexa;
Molecular Probes) diluted 1:200 in PBS. Finally slides were washed with PBS
and examined using a NICON inverted microscope.
Magnetic Sorting and Lentiviral Infections. Cells were washed with PBS, collected by trypsinization, and incubated in suspension with mouse anti-NCAM
antibody (Chemicon) diluted 1:1,000 in MACSbuffer (PBS, 0.5%BSA, 2 mM EDTA)
for 15 min at 4 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with
MACS buffer, and incubated in suspension in rat anti-mouse IgM microbeads
(Miltenyi Biotech) diluted 1:5 in MACS buffer for 15 min at 4 °C. Then, the cells
were washed once with MACS buffer and sorted using MACS separation columns (Miltenyi Biotech). After sorting, cells were plated in N2B27 medium on
24-well plates (100,000 cells/well) coated with laminin (Sigma) and polyornithin
(Sigma). Four days after sorting, cells were infected with lentivirus at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Media were changed after overnight infection.
Real-Time PCR Analysis. Total RNA was prepared using the RNAeasy mini kit
(Qiagen), treated with DNase (Qiagen), and reverse transcribed using
SuperScriptIII (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR analysis was performed on the RotorGene RG-3000A (Corbett Research), using SYBR green PCR Mastermix (Applied
Biosystems). For a list of primers used see SI Appendix, SI Text. All values were
normalized against GAPDH and presented as relative increase of mRNA levels.
Data are presented as the mean ± SEM of quadruplicate samples.
Treatment of Cells with Oligonucleotides. Single-stranded phosphorothioate
oligonucleotides were synthesized by IBA, annealed by heating to 95 °C for
10 min followed by cooling to room temperature over 2 h, and added to the
cells at a concentration of 600 nM in the presence of DOTAP (Boehringer
Mannheim). After 5 h the medium was changed. For a list of oligonucleotides used see SI Appendix, SI Text.
Animal Experiments. NR4A3−/− mice (provided by Deltagen; SI Appendix, Fig. S8)
were crossed with NR4A2+/− mice to generate NR4A3+/−; NR4A2+/− mice, which
were backcrossed with NR4A3−/− mice to ﬁnally generate NR4Amut mice
(NR4A3−/−; NR4A2+/−). Eight-week-old mice were single caged, handled for 5 d,
and then injected intraperitoneally with KA (Sigma) at 25 mg/kg of body weight
or saline. The animals were killed at different time points after the injection by
carbon monoxide inhalation and the whole brain was removed. Half of the
brain was sliced into 14-mM-thick cryostat sections whereas the other half of
the brain was used to dissect the hippocampus, which was placed in RNA later
(Qiagen). Sections were stained with cresyl violet (Sigma-Aldrich), FluoroJade-B
(Millipore), DAPI (Molecular Probes), or a rabbit antibody against 5-nitrotyrosine (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Three
saline- and three KA-injected mice of each genotype were used for each of the
different time points. All animal procedures were approved by the animal
welfare ofﬁce of the Stockholm district court.
Microarray Analysis. Microarray experiments were carried out using GeneChip
430A 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

NEUROSCIENCE

NR4A2, form heterodimers with RXR. It is interesting to note that
NR4A2 plays a key role in the development of dopamine neurons
and ligands activating RXR can protect these cells in culture (19,
42). Thus, RXR may be a relevant target for ligand modulation of
NR4A-regulated processes. Moreover, NR4A activity is possible
to modulate, e.g., by the leukemia drug 6-mercaptopurine (43).
Although 6-mercaptopurine mediates serious side effects, other
compounds with higher speciﬁcity may be possible to identify.
CREB has also been found to induce PGC-1α expression (3, 14,
44–46). We show here that PGC-1α is expressed in neurons exposed to oxidative stress, as previously observed in ﬁbroblasts (14),
but it failed to be induced by excitotoxic insult induced by ionomycin and glutamate. Interestingly, the selective regulation by
different stimuli correlated with the ability of PGC-1α to protect
neurons against oxidative but not excitotoxic stress. Thus, distinct
insults elicit selective CREB-dependent cellular responses adapted to the nature of the neuronal insult.
As both NR4A and PGC-1α protect against oxidative stress
in response to activated CREB, an important question concerns
the functional relationship between these two CREB-dependent
transcriptional regulators. PGC-1α is a coactivator that exerts
pleiotropic effects in the control of energy homeostasis by interacting with transcription factors. Notably, an important group of
PGC-1α-interacting factors are members of the nuclear receptor
family. However, PGC-1α is probably not a coactivator of NR4A
receptors (47). In contrast, we favor that these transcriptional
regulators act via independent pathways for the following reasons:
First, NR4A and PGC-1α activate almost completely independent
sets of target genes. Second, coexpression of PGC-1α together with
NR4A2 did not enhance the expression of tested NR4A targets
(SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Third, coexpression of both PGC-1α and
NR4A2 resulted in additive rather than synergistic protection of
neurons. Fourth, analogous to the pathway described here, NR4A
and PGC-1α cooperate in the glucagon-cAMP-induced transcriptional regulation of hepatic glucose metabolism by independent
regulation of distinct gene sets important in the control of hepatic
glucose metabolism (47). Thus, similar to the glucagon-cAMP
axis in the liver, NR4A2 and PGC-1α appear to represent two
independent but complementary CREB-dependent regulatory
“legs” in the adaptation to neuronal stress.
Oxidative stress is central to the pathology in many disorders
associated with neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer’s and
Parkinson’s diseases. Excitotoxicity induced by kainic acid induces oxidative stress as reﬂected in the appearance of nitrosylated
protein species following kainic acid treatment. It is interesting
to note that gene ablation of only three of six NR4A alleles reported here shows a severe increase in oxidative stress and neuronal death in animals treated with kainic acid. Thus, our results
in in vitro cultured neurons and in vivo collectively demonstrate
that NR4A receptors mediate a unique and essential downstream
pathway of neuroprotection after insults leading to excitotoxic
and oxidative stress.
