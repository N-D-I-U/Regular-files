SUMMARY

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to both neuronal and
immune cell fate, but their involvement in intertissue
communication remained unexplored. The brain, via
vagal secretion of acetylcholine (ACh), suppresses
peripheral inflammation by intercepting cytokine
production; therefore, we predicted that microRNAs
targeting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) can attenuate
inflammation. Here, we report that inflammatory
stimuli induced leukocyte overexpression of the
AChE-targeting miR-132. Injected locked nucleic
acid (LNA)-modified anti-miR-132 oligonucleotide
depleted miR-132 amounts while elevating AChE in
mouse circulation and tissues. In transfected cells,
a mutated 30 UTR miR-132 binding site increased
AChE mRNA expression, whereas cells infected
with a lentivirus expressing pre-miR-132 showed
suppressed AChE. Transgenic mice overexpressing
30 UTR null AChE showed excessive inflammatory
mediators and impaired cholinergic anti-inflammatory regulation, in spite of substantial miR-132
upregulation in brain and bone marrow. Our findings
identify the AChE mRNA-targeting miR-132 as a functional regulator of the brain-to-body resolution of
inflammation, opening avenues for study and therapeutic manipulations of the neuro-immune dialog.
INTRODUCTION
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved short noncoding RNAs that regulate multiple molecular pathways in
specific cell or tissue types (Ambros, 2004; Landgraf et al.,
2007; Lim et al., 2003); however, their relevance for systemic
interactions such as brain-body signaling is yet unknown. miRNAs often bind their mRNA targets based on sequence complementarity in specific locations on the 30 untranslated region (UTR)
of the mRNA, termed miRNA response elements (MREs). This
leads to translational repression and/or degradation of the
mRNA. Each miRNA potentially binds multiple mRNAs (Krek
et al., 2005). miRNA expression varies with cell type, tissue,
and developmental stage (Baek et al., 2008) and spans both

neural and immune cells (Liang et al., 2007; Plasterk, 2006).
Specifically, bacterial endotoxin- or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)exposed human monocytes overproduce several miRNAs, e.g.,
miR-146a, 155, and 132, whereas cytokines such as TNF upregulate miR-155 and 125b (Tili et al., 2007) and immune regulators
like IFN-b reduce miR-122 as part of an antiviral protection
response (Pedersen et al., 2007). The NF-kB-dependent miR146a targets the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated
factor 6 (TRAF6) (Taganov et al., 2006). miR-155 targets the interleukin-1 signaling pathway in monocytes (Ceppi et al., 2009) as
well as angiotensin II type I receptor in fibroblasts (Martin et al.,
2006) and regulates T cell differentiation and antibody response
through the JNK kinase pathway, which activates the AP-1
complex (Rodriguez et al., 2007). miR-155 null mice are immune
deficient (Thai et al., 2007), suggesting that LPS-induced miRs
regulate immunity. Our study focused on the inflammation-associated role(s) of miR-132, which has demonstrated function and
high expression in the brain (Cheng et al., 2007).
We predicted miR involvement in brain-body communication
such as the neuro-endocrine modulation of inflammation
(De Kloet et al., 1998; McEwen, 2007), whereby innate immunity
is regulated by acetylcholine (ACh) to optimize the resolution of
inflammation (Sternberg, 2006). Specifically, afferent fibers of
the vagus nerve signal the presence of circulating proinflammatory cytokines to the brain (Watkins and Maier, 1999). Reciprocally, efferent vagus nerve fibers release ACh, which binds a7
nicotinic receptors on macrophages, intercepts the nuclear
translocation of NFkB, and inhibits the production of proinflammatory mediators (de Jonge et al., 2005; Metz and Tracey,
2005; Watkins and Maier, 1999). Activation of this ‘‘cholinergic
reflex’’ has been shown to alleviate inflammatory disease,
including endotoxemia (Pavlov et al., 2007), sepsis (van Westerloo et al., 2005), colitis (Pullan et al., 1994), pancreatitis (van
Westerloo et al., 2006), ischemia reperfusion (Altavilla et al.,
2006), and acute lung injury (Su et al., 2007). At the tissue level,
synaptophysin-positive nerve endings interact with spleen
macrophages, and surgical ablation of the splenic nerve indicates that these interactions are required for the cholinergic
anti-inflammatory control of endotoxemia (Rosas-Ballina et al.,
2008). Thus, brain-body communication through ACh is intimately involved in the regulation of inflammation.
ACh is hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) (Soreq and Seidman, 2001); therefore, high
amounts of these enzymes could potentially negate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory signal (Ofek et al., 2007). Supporting

miR-132 Restricts Inflammation by Targeting AChE

this notion, AChE inhibition restricts inflammation in both the
peripheral and the central nervous system (CNS) (Pollak et al.,
2005; Pavlov et al., 2009). We therefore predicted that microRNAs
targeting AChE can attenuate inflammation.
RESULTS
AChE Is Downregulated after LPS Exposure
In murine splenocytes, AChE (but not BChE; Figure S1A available online) mRNA, protein, and activity were all substantially
reduced 24 hr after LPS (endotoxin, a Toll-like receptor TLR4
ligand) treatment (Figures 1A–1C). The post-LPS downregulation
of AChE could be reproduced in vivo, by intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injection of LPS that upregulated interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1b
while reducing serum AChE activity (Figures 1D–1F), suggesting
that systemic reduction of AChE activity is an integral part of the
postinflammatory response.
miRNAs Targeting AChE Are Induced by LPS
in Both Mice and Humans
To find miRNAs that could potentially downregulate cholinesterases, we used PicTar (Krek et al., 2005), miRanda (John et al.,
2004), and an in-house target prediction algorithm. To test whether
the in silico-identified miRNAs respond to inflammation, we used an
in-house spotted microarray. No miRNAs were predicted to target
both AChE and BChE, and miRNAs induced by immune challenges
did not include sequences that could target BChE (Figure S1B). In
contrast, two miRNAs complementary to AChE’s 30 UTR were
induced by LPS: miR-132 and miR-182* (processed from the
same precursor molecule as miR-182; sequences and alignments
in Figures S1C and S1D), compatible with the immune modulation
of AChE activity in nucleated blood cells (Pick et al., 2006). miR-132
and miR-182* are intergenically encoded and dissimilar. Binding
sites for miR-132 and 182* at bases 961 and 704 of AChE 30
UTR, respectively (Figure S1C), showed high conservation across
species, supporting their physiological relevance.
Spotted array analysis showed that miR-132, among others,
was consistently upregulated in primary human macrophages
by LPS (Figure 1G) as well as by additional immunogens, e.g.,
the TLR9 ligand CpG oligonucleotide (ODN) 2006, which is
known to react to LPS (Figures S1E and S1F; Tables S2 and
S3 of array results; Hartmann et al., 1999). QRT-PCR validation
confirmed that LPS exposure elevates miR-132 and 182* but
not other hematopoietic miRs (e.g., miR-181a), in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1H; Figure S1G). This increase, which
occurred 12–24 hr after the onset of inflammation, was paralleled
by a reduction in AChE protein (Figures 1A–1C; Figure S1H) that
could enable the attenuation of inflammation by ACh in a physiological system. Supporting this notion, AChE reduction was
observed both in the bone marrow (BM) and spleen of LPSinjected FVB-N mice (Figures 1A–1C and 1F) and in humanand mouse-derived cell lines (Figure S2). Both AChE-targeting
miRNAs increased in an LPS dose-dependent manner, peaking
at 1 mg/ml LPS (Figure S1G) and at 24 hr postexposure in cultured
macrophages, and LPS-exposed mice reached double the
expression seen in bone marrow (BM) and splenocytes of control
mice at the same time point (Figure 1I). Taken together, these
results indicate inherent involvement of changes in miR-132
and miR-182* in the inflammatory reaction to LPS exposure.

accompanied by increases in AChE but not BChE (data not
shown) activity in the small intestine, serum, and bone marrow
(Figure 2C). Likewise, AChE protein expression increased in
anti-132-treated mice (Figure 2D). In individual mice, relative
spleen miR-132 expression (in anti-132-, scr-, and mock-treated
groups) showed an inverse correlation when plotted against
serum AChE activities of the same mice (Figure 2E), suggesting
that miR-132 is a major systemic regulator of AChE. These findings further demonstrate that the anti-132 oligonucleotide can
serve to manipulate the systemic expression of AChE.

but not miR-182* expression in both BM and spleen (Figure 2B),

Regulation of AChE by LPS Shows an Inverse Pattern
to miR-132, 182* Changes
In the RAW 264.7 murine macrophage-derived cell line, LPS
exposure induced robust increases of nitric oxide (NO), IL-6,
and TNF-a within 24 hr, reflecting an inflammatory response.
This was accompanied by robust decreases in AChE activity
(Figure S2B) and a marked elevation in miR-132 and miR-182*
expression, whereas AChE mRNA expression was essentially
unchanged in this test (Figures S2D–S2F). By 24 hr after exposure, both human-derived U937 cells and mouse-derived RAW
264.7 cells showed reduced AChE activity (Figure S2C), similar
to that achieved by treatment with 10 mM of the selective AChE
inhibitor, BW 284 C51 (Figure S2D). Inversely, ACh blocked the
LPS-induced increase in NO as efficiently as dexamethasone
(Figure S2E). Also, untreated cells showed NF-kB labeling in
the cytoplasm, whereas LPS exposure shifted NF-kB labeling
to the nucleus, but coexposure to both LPS and ACh inhibited
this translocation (data not shown), demonstrating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex.
The ‘‘Cister’’ algorithm (Frith et al., 2001) identified binding
motifs for inflammation-associated transcription factors in the
5 kb genomic regions upstream of the miR-132 and miR-182*
precursors (Figures S3A and S3B), suggesting that the promoters of both of these AChE-targeting miRs bind AP-1, involved in cellular proliferation, transformation, and death (Shaulian and Karin, 2002). AP-1 is composed of members of the Jun
and Fos family of transcription factors, and c-Jun plays essential
roles in the immune responses of pattern recognition receptors
(Akira, 2006). For miR-132, the Cister algorithm also identified
the calcium-response element CRE. Its binding protein, CREB,
responds to cholinergic signals via the a7 nicotinic ACh receptor
(Bitner et al., 2007) as a late event in inflammatory reactions (Kang
et al., 2007). Thus, miRNAs targeting AChE mRNA, like AChE
itself, emerged as likely mediators of inflammatory reactions.
Mutation or Deletion of the miR-132 Binding Site in
AChE mRNA Elevates AChE Activity in Transfected Cells
To more directly test for regulation of AChE by miR-132, we
transfected CHO cells with AChE expression vectors encoding
either a native UTR or UTR with mutated miR-132 MRE. CHO
cells express miR-132 at about 20 fmoles/mg (104 molecules
per ng RNA), higher than the basal expression in mouse splenocytes yet lower than that in the mouse cortex (Figure 3A). In
contrast, CHO cells have almost no endogenous AChE (Figure 3B). After transfection, cells expressing the 30 UTR-mutated
construct produced higher AChE activities than those expressing the native 30 UTR control, validating the importance of the
miR-132 MRE in regulation of AChE (Figure 3B).

Overexpression of miR-132 via Lentiviral Infection
Downregulates AChE Activity in Primary Cultured Cells
To further test the regulation of AChE by miR-132, we overexpresed miR-132 by infecting BM-derived macrophages, extracted from FVB-N mice, with either a pre-miR-132 expression
vector or a control vector containing a scrambled sequence (Figure 3C). 72 hr after infection, AChE activity of BM cells infected
by the miR-132 vector was downregulated by 60% (Figure 3D)
relative to cells infected with scrambled vector. Together with
the above mutation studies, these findings demonstrate that
creating miR-132 loss of function by ablating the miR-132
binding site elevates, whereas implementing miR-132 gain of
function by enhancing miR-132 expression through lentiviral
infection suppresses, AChE expression.

context of the anti-inflammatory reflex. Because of the absence
of the functionally relevant MRE, we predicted that AChE activity
in TgR mice should not be suppressed by miR-132, even when
it is elevated after inflammatory insults, and that ACh should
therefore fail to attenuate innate immunity reactions, e.g., the
response to LPS (Scheme, Figure 4B). Supporting this hypothesis, intestinal explants from TgR mice, in addition to showing
elevated AChE activity (Figure 4C) and AChE protein expression
(Figure 4D), displayed higher basal amounts of circulation cytokines (IL-1b and Il-6 and IL-10) compared to FVB-N counterparts. The cytokine overproduction in the TgR intestine could
be rebalanced with i.p. injection of the ACh receptor agonist
nicotine (Figures 4E–4G), demonstrating that the cholinergic
suppression of inflammation was not impaired in these mice
because of missing ACh receptors and/or downstream signaling. AChE protein in TgR intestine reached similar amounts as
those in anti-132-treated mice (Figure 4D), consistent with the
role of miR-132 as a major physiological regulator of ACh
signaling.
Mice notably respond to LPS administration with dynamic
changes in their body temperature. First, they develop hyperthermia that is thereafter followed by hypothermia (due to peripheral vasodilatation) (Splawinski et al., 1977). To assess the
impact of 30 UTR null AChE overexpression on this robust physiological response, rectal temperatures were measured in FVBN and TgR mice after i.p. injection of LPS. TgR mice notably
differed from FVB-N wild-type mice both in their lower basal
body temperatures and in their LPS fever response. Whereas
FVB-N mice display transient hyperthermia, TgR mice respond
to LPS by initial hypothermia followed by prolonged hyperthermia (Figure 4H). TgR mice further showed higher expression
of miR-132 than wild-type mice, in the periphery, BM, and the
brain, especially in the pyrogenic cytokine-responding hypothalamus (Figure 4I; Blatteis, 2007), suggesting feedback regulation
between miR-132 and AChE expression that spans both body
and relevant regions in the brain.
In agreement with the effects in intestinal tissue, BM-derived
macrophages from both wild-type and TgR mice overproduced
IL6, IL12, and TNF-a when challenged with LPS ex vivo; however,
coadministration of LPS and ACh prevented this increase in FVBN but not TgR-derived macrophages (Figures 4J–4L), demonstrating that excessive ACh hydrolysis impairs the cholinergic
anti-inflammatory response. TgR mice further presented excessive leukocyte recruitment into the peritoneum after thioglycolate
injection, displayed by higher numbers of Mac-1- (CD11b, a
complement receptor typical of activated macrophages) expressing cells than control mice (Figures S3C and S3D), suggesting systemically deregulated immunity in these mice.
DISCUSSION
Our findings demonstrate that AChE-targeting miR-132 can
attenuate inflammation by reducing AChE amounts, thus
enhancing the brain’s ability to govern inflammation via cholinergic signaling. We found that excessive inflammation upregulates miR-132. In miR-132-expressing cultured cells, ectopic
AChE expression was elevated by introducing a point mutation
in the native miR-132 MRE. Infection with lentivirus expressing
pre-miR-132 suppressed AChE in cultured BM cells. Depleting

miR-132 in vivo in the BM and spleen increased peripheral AChE
activity in the intestine, serum, and bone marrow. TgR mice,
overexpressing MRE null AChE, lost the ability to attenuate
inflammation by cholinergic signaling, although their excessive
inflammatory response was quenchable by nicotine, a cholinergic agonist not hydrolyzed by AChE. Despite expressing
miR-132 at high amounts, TgR MRE null mice lacked the ability
to benefit from the regulation of AChE expression by miRNAs.
The nervous system was shown to profoundly regulate the
innate immune system. Direct innervation of lymphatic organs
(Pavlov et al., 2007) or inflamed tissues (Tracey, 2007) restricts
the inflammatory burden. Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides
bind to specific receptors expressed by leukocytes, inhibiting
production of proinflammatory mediators (Sternberg, 2006).
Neuronal and leukocyte miRNAs can thus provide a fine-tuning
tool for these sensitive neuro-immune checkpoints.
We focused our current study on miR-132, well characterized
by others in brain neurons, because of its robust induction in
leukocytes after LPS. miR-132 is upregulated by the cAMPresponse element binding protein (CREB) (Vo et al., 2005) and
downregulated by the RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST)
(Conaco et al., 2006), compatible with a role in regulating cholinergic communication. AChE, in turn, is a stress-induced gene
(Kaufer et al., 1998; Meshorer et al., 2002; Meshorer and Soreq,
2002); its upregulation induces lymphopoiesis and thrombopoiesis (Gilboa-Geffen et al., 2007; Pick et al., 2006). Our findings
suggest that the poststress surge in these processes can be
terminated by miR-132-mediated downregulation of AChE.
To assess the involvement of miRs in the inflammatory reflex,
we tested both in vivo and in vitro systems. Supportive evidence
was found in murine and human macrophage-derived cell lines
known to respond to LPS by production of proinflammatory
mediators; in primary human macrophages; and in primary peritoneal and bone marrow macrophages obtained from transgenic
and control mice, as well as in intestinal explants and in naive
FVB-N mice as an in vivo model.
The miR-AChE regulation module is likely to also exist in the
brain itself, where both miR-132 (Cheng et al., 2007) and AChE
(Soreq and Seidman, 2001) are found at higher concentrations
than in other tissues. Several reports further tie AChE and miR132 to the same neuronal processes, e.g., the circadian clock
within the SCN. AChE peaks during sleeping phases and reaches a minimum during activity hours (Schiebeler and von
Mayersbach, 1974). Inversely, miR-132 expression is high during
the day, when it contributes to the photic resetting of the clock
(Cheng et al., 2007). Our findings suggest that this reflects
a causal relationship between AChE and miR-132 expression.

(Sklan et al., 2004), and excessive cytokine amounts are a major
cause of tissue injury and organ failure (Wang et al., 2004).
Inherited impairments in AChE-targeting miRs can hence be
detrimental, which raises the possibility for miR-based diagnostics of susceptibility to inflammatory and cholinergic-related maladies. After heart failure, miR-212 (Thum et al., 2007), identical in
its ‘‘seed’’ sequence to miR-132, is upregulated, whereas AChE
activity decreases (Dunlap et al., 2003). These two miRNAs are
encoded in tandem within 300 bp in the human genome and
may share the same primary transcript, suggesting common
regulation.
miRNAs regulating signaling networks have potential both as
research tools and as a unique class of therapeutic targets
(Baek et al., 2008). Experimentally validated approaches include,
but are not limited to, synthetic RNAs that contain the binding
sites of miRNAs and function as ‘‘decoys’’ to competitively
inhibit the function of specific miRs (Care et al., 2007); miRNA
expression vectors that restore or overexpress specific miRNAs
to achieve a long-term effect on their mRNA targets (Voorhoeve
et al., 2006); double-stranded miRNA mimics and pre-miRNA
stem-loops to achieve transient upregulation; and chemically
protected antisense oligonucleotides (Elmen et al., 2008;
Krutzfeldt et al., 2005) for manipulating the amounts and activity
of miRNA transcripts. Here, we employed the fourth method to
upregulate AChE amounts in the circulation by inhibiting miR132 and the third method to suppress AChE by miR-132 overexpression. Thus, different circumstances may call for different
manipulations of the AChE transcript; for example in Alzheimer
disease (Berson et al., 2008; Giacobini, 2003; Rees et al., 2003)
or in a stress and anxiety state (Sklan et al., 2004), AChE activity
should be limited whereas in organophosphate poisoning it
should be enhanced (Evron et al., 2007; Wolfe et al., 1987).
Inflammatory restriction via innervation is not limited to parasympathetic cholinergic signaling. Neuro-immune regulation is
also exerted by sympathetic adrenergic, neuroendocrine hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA), and hypothalamic-pituitarygonadal (HPG) pathways (Sternberg, 2006). Neuropeptides of
the peripheral nervous system (PNS) also play a role in controlling immunity. For instance, pancreatic neurons control islet
inflammation and insulin resistance by secreting substance P
(Razavi et al., 2006). miR-132-mediated control of inflammation
hence potentially represents a wider phenomenon.
In conclusion, we define a unique evolutionarily conserved
miRNA-gene target relationship, which regulates brain-body
communication, cholinergic signaling, and inflammation and
which may be relevant for numerous other processes. Additionally, we propose that proteins that are located at neuro-immune
crossroads (like AChE) are likely to be regulated by miRNAs and
thus provide new targets for research as well as for diagnostic
and therapeutic intervention. The ‘‘micromanagement’’ of brainbody communication thus merits special attention.

Young (6- to 10-week-old) female FVB-N mice were injected i.v. with 3 daily 3.3
mg doses of an oligonucleotide complementary to mature miR-132 (anti-132)
or a scrambled sequence control oligonucleotide (scr) in PBS. The oligonucleotides (from Sigma-Proligo) had full-length phosphorothioate backbones and
>50% LNA bases (Elmen et al., 2008), as indicated in Figure 2A. 24 hr after the

970 Immunity 31, 965–973, December 18, 2009 ª2009 Elsevier Inc.

last injection, the animals were sacrificed and blood and tissue samples were
collected. Mice from the same batch were used for single i.p. injection with
5 mg LPS in PBS or PBS alone; blood samples were collected after 2 hr and
animals were sacrificed after 48 hr.
Body temperatures were measured according to Habicht (1981) by rectal
insertion of a thermocouple. To obtain a steady measurement, the probe
had to be inserted exactly 1.5 cm. Mice were restrained in a plastic device,
in full compliance with the guidelines of animal maintenance personnel. No
anesthesia was used that could affect body temperature. The study was
approved by The Hebrew University’s Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation.
Lentiviral Expression
miRNA expression vectors containing either a pre-miR-132 overexpression
cassette or a scrambled sequence for control were from GeneCopoeia
(Germantown, MD). 0.7 mg of envelope plasmid, 1 mg of packaging plasmid,
and 1 mg miR vector were added to 250 ml of serum-free DMEM medium supplemented with 1 mM glutamine and 50 mg/ml gentamycin. 10 ml of 1 mg/ml
polyethylenimine (PEI, Sigma) was added and the mix was vortexed and incubated for 10 min at RT. HEK293T cells, grown to 90% confluence, were
washed with PBS and 5 ml of serum-free medium was added. Cells were
transduced with the PEI/plasmids mix. 4 hr later, 0.5 ml of fetal calf serum
(FCS) was added. Medium with virions was collected after 24 and 48 hr, filtered
through 0.22 mm-pore filters, and stored in aliquots at 70 C. Bone marrow
(BM)-derived macrophages from FVB-N mice were infected with the various
virions. Cells were harvested 72 hr after infection.
Intestinal Explants Extraction
FVB-N or TgR mice were injected i.p. with either 400 mg/kg nicotine (Sigma,
Israel) or saline twice a day for 3 consecutive days. 24 hr after the last injection,
mice were sacrificed, and a 20 cm section of the small intestine was dissected, washed in cold PBS, and cut into 2.5 cm explants that were cleaned
by cotton swab and incubated for 24 hr in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 50 mM b-mercaptoethanol,
1 mM glutamine, and 50 mg/ml gentamycin, to be extracted for further
assessments.
Prediction of miR Target Sites
30 UTR sequences were retrieved from the Entrez Nucleotide database (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=Nucleotide). For each gene, the
sequence from the end of the coding sequence (CDS) to the polyadenylation
(PolyA) signal was used. The polyA signal was found through the Entrez Nucleotide database documentation or manually for sequences that were not documented. When more than one PolyA signal was found, each PolyA signal
dictated a separate 30 UTR sequence to be retrieved. The 30 UTR sequences
were reverse complemented to comply with the application of UTR-miRs
binding prediction. Human and mouse AChE 30 UTR sequences were verified
via the NCBI Expressed Sequence Tags database (dbEST) (Boguski et al.,
1993). AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were retrieved from the Entrez
Nucleotide database or by matching mammalian cloned sequences to the
human sequences through NCBI nucleotide-nucleotide BLAST (blastn). 470
mature human miR sequences were retrieved from miRBase Sequences
(Release 9.0) (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2006). For each miR sequence and for
each 30 UTR reverse complement sequence, a fasta file was created in the
UNIX environment. Each miR fasta file was aligned with each 30 UTR fasta
sequence with a Perl script and the EMBOSS application ‘‘wordcount’’ that
finds all exact matches of a given length between two sequences. Prediction
was simplified to an exact seven word length complementarity of the 50 seed
of the miRs, bases 1 to 7 or 2 to 8, with the 30 UTR of the target gene. All other
seven word length matches were omitted from further considerations. miRNAs
predicted to target the AChE and BChE mRNAs by our algorithm were scrutinized for evolutionary conservation of their putative binding sites on the
30 UTR of AChE splice variants by alignment to the 30 UTR of AChE mRNA
from four other mammals (Mus musculus, Pan troglodytes, Bos taurus, and
Pongo pygmaeus). The longest possible 30 UTR of human AChE (3118 b from
stop codon to end of GeneBank entry) includes 146 miR recognition elements
(MRE), 15 of which were conserved in AChE from Mus musculus, Pan troglodytes, Rattus norvegicus, and Rhesus macaque. In comparison, only 24 miRs

Immunity
miR-132 Restricts Inflammation by Targeting AChE

were predicted to bind the 30 UTR sequence of human BChE. Four of these were
conserved in Mus musculus, Pan troglodytes, Bos taurus, and Pongo pygmaeus, none similar to the AChE-targeted miRs. For further analysis, we used
a shorter (and prevalent) 964 b 30 UTR sequence. The analysis was repeated
with PicTar (Krek et al., 2005) and miRanda (John et al., 2004) algorithms.
Preparation of Primary Human Macrophages
We used primary human macrophages because of our finding that human
patients who were injected intravenously with LPS showed deregulated
cholinergic status (Ofek et al., 2007). Pathogen-negative leukopacks (Buffy
coat) (Davies and Gordon, 2005) obtained from the Blood Bank at the Hadassah Medical Center (Ein Kerem) were transferred into 50 ml conical tubes
(10 ml/tube) and diluted 1:2 with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS, Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel). The diluted blood was gently
layered on top of 20 ml of lymphocyte separation medium (LSM) over Ficoll
(MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) without mixing the layers. After centrifugation
(500 3 g, 30 min, 20 C, without brake), three layers were obtained (plasma
and platelets, lymphocytes, erythrocytes and granulocytes). The upper phase
was drawn with a Pasteur pipette until reaching 2 mm above the interphase
cloud, and then 5 to 10 ml interphase lymphocytes were drawn gently with
a 1 ml pipette, washed once with 45 ml PBS, and centrifuged (400 3 g, 10 min,
room temp.). Pellets from all tubes were resuspended in a total of 40 ml PBS.
An aliquot of cells was counted in a hemacytometer by using 0.5% Trypan Blue
Solution (Biological Industries) to determine cell number and viability. Cells
were then centrifuged (200 3 g, 5 min, room temp) and resuspended at
a concentration of 5 3 106 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 2.5% heat-inactivated (56 C, 30 min) human serum (Sigma).
10 ml of cell suspension were plated in 75 ml flasks and incubated (2 hr,
37 C, 5% CO2). Nonadherent cells were then removed and the adherent
monocytes washed three times with warm PBS. Cells were incubated for
2 hr in 10 ml per dish of RPMI-1640 supplemented with LPS-free 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-Glutamine and 0.5% penicillin plus streptomycin
(GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA) and washed three times with warm PBS and 10 ml of
complete RPMI supplemented with 10 U/ml granulocyte-monocyte colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF, Sigma, G5035) added every 2–3 days. By day
7, monocytes were differentiated to macrophages. Escherichia coli LPS
(Sigma) was added to the growth medium to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml,
which was found optimal to induce innate immune reaction. For comparison,
we added 1 mM of the TLR9 ligand CpG 2006 (type B; 50 -TCGTCGTTTTGT
CGTTTTGTCGTT-30 ; Microsynth GmbH) for 24 hr. Cells were washed 2–3
times with cold PBS, then incubated in 5 ml of cold filtered PBS + EDTA 2
mM (pH 7.2) for 10–15 min on ice. Flasks were then tapped firmly to loosen
cell attachment, and cells were gently scraped and collected by centrifugation
(4 C, 800 rpm, 10 min). Immunostaining, cell sorting by fluorescent activated
cell sorter, and quantitative RT-PCR were as detailed in Supplemental Data.
Spotted Array
The mirVana oligo set (Ambion, Austin, TX; Catalog number 1564V1) was used
to construct our in-house array with >200 spotted probes complementary to
known human and mouse miRs. To compose the array, the mirVana probeset
was dissolved in 33SSC to a final concentration of 20 mM, and each oligo was
printed on Ultragaps slides (Corning, Corning, NY) six or more times, via the
MicroGrid spotter (Genomic Solutions, Holliston, MA). Dye-swapping tests
served to exclude dye-specific labeling differences (Dombkowski et al.,
2004). Labeling used the CyDye reactive dye pack (Amersham, NSW,
Australia) as instructed. Prehybridization was in preheated 53SSC, 1%
BSA, 0.1% SDS (42 C, 45 min). Cy3- and Cy5-labeled fragmented RNA
(3 mg each) were added to the hybridization solution (33SSC, 0.1% SDS,
10 mg polyA, 20 mg tRNA), heated at 95 C for 4 min for eliminating secondary
structures, and applied to the slides in hybridization chambers (Corning, NY)
for 15 hr at 64 C. Hybridized slides were successively washed in: 13SSC,
0.1% SDS (5 min); 0.13SSC, 0.1% SDS (5 min); and 0.13SSC (3 3 1.5 min)
and dried by centrifugation (1000 3 g). Scanning and quantification was
adapted from Ben-Ari et al. (2006).

fection of an AChE expression vector. All cells were grown in a humidified
atmosphere at 37 C, 5% CO2. Human U937 cells were grown in 5 ml flasks
in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 2 mM L-glutamine. RAW
264.7 and CHO cells were grown in 5 ml flasks in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM, Biological Industries) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Biological Industries). BW284c51 (BW;
Sigma), a specific AChE inhibitor, was administered at a final concentration
of 10 mM. Acetylcholine chloride (ACh; Sigma) was administered at a final
concentration of 100 mM.
Inflammatory Biomarker Measurements
Griess method (Green et al., 1982) was used to determine NO levels in conditioned medium from macrophage cultures. 100 ml of each sample + 100 ml of
Griess reagent (1% sulfanylamide/0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride/2.5% H3PO4) were incubated for 10–20 min at room temp. Absorbance was read at 546 nm in a micro-ELISA reader (Guimaraes-Sternberg
et al., 2006). TNF-a, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1b expression was measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to manufacturer’s
procedures (R&D Systems kits, MTA00, M6000B, respectively). All absorbance results were normalized via standard curves. Rectal temperatures
were measured in 4 mice per group of 8-week-old FVB-N and strain-matched
TgR mice after i.p. injection of 2 mg/kg LPS. Cholinesterase catalytic activity
measurement was as in Ofek et al. (2007) via 5 3 105 M tetraisopropyl pyrophosphoramide (iso-OMPA, Sigma), a specific butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)
inhibitor, to assay for AChE-specific or total cholinesterase activity. Each
sample was assayed in n = 3 or more.
Transfection
The wild-type and mutated 30 UTR sequence of human AChE with appropriate
restriction sites (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ) was ligated into the AChE expression vector CMV-AChE (Ben Aziz Aloya et al., 1993) via standard molecular
cloning techniques. Transfection of RAW 264.7 and CHO cells was performed
with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with 3 mg of oligo vector
DNA per sample. In brief, cells were brought to 80%–90% confluence at the
time of transfection. For each transfection sample, 3 mg oligo or plasmid and
the lipofectamine reagent were both diluted in 0.25–1 ml of unsupplemented
growth medium. After 5 min the diluted oligo and lipofectamine were combined,
incubated for 20 min, and added to the cells. Medium was replaced at 6 hr and
cells harvested 24 hr posttransfection. A GFP expression vector served as
negative control for AChE activity and to assay transfection efficiency.
Bone Marrow Culture
Bone marrow cells were prepared from femurs and tibiae of 8- to 12-week-old
female FVB/N wild-type or AChE-R overexpressing TgR mice as previously
described (Lutz et al., 1999), with minor modifications. Surgically removed
cleaned bones were left in 70% ethanol for 2–5 min for disinfection and
washed with PBS, and the marrow was flushed with PBS in a syringe with
a 0.45 mm diameter needle. Clusters within the marrow suspension were disintegrated by vigorous pipetting. After one wash in PBS, about 1–1.5 3 107
leukocytes were obtained per femur or tibia. Cells were seeded in 25 ml flasks
(Nunc TM) at 4 3 105 cells/ml with RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 50 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM
glutamine, 50 mg/ml gentamycin, and 200 U/ml recombinant murine granulocyte macrophage-stimulating factor, rmGM-CSF (Sigma). Freshly prepared
medium was added every 3 days and cells were used on day 11 of culture
(maximum of CD11c expression as checked by FACS analysis).
