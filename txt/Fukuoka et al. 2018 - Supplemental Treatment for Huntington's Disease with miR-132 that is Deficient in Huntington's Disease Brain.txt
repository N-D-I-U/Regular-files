Huntington’s disease (HD) is an intractable neurodegenerative
disorder caused by mutant Huntingtin (HTT) proteins that
adversely affect various biomolecules and genes. MicroRNAs
(miRNAs), which are functional small non-coding RNAs, are
also affected by mutant HTT proteins. Here, we show amelioration in motor function and lifespan of HD-model mice,
R6/2 mice, by supplying miR-132 to HD brains using a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) miRNA expression system. miR-132 is an miRNA related to neuronal maturation
and function, but the level of miR-132 in the brain of R6/2
mice was signiﬁcantly lower than that of wild-type mice. Our
miR-132 supplemental treatment, i.e., supplying miR-132 to
the brain, produced symptomatic improvement or retarded
disease progression in R6/2 mice; interestingly, it had little effect on disease-causing mutant HTT mRNA expression and its
products. Therefore, the ﬁndings suggest that there may be a
therapeutic way to treat HD without inhibiting and/or repairing disease-causing HTT genes and gene products. Although
miR-132 supplement may not be a deﬁnitive treatment for
HD, it may become a therapeutic method for relieving HD
symptoms and delaying HD progression.

INTRODUCTION
Huntington’s disease (HD; OMIM #143100) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by chorea movement, muscular incoordination, cognitive decline, and psychiatric
problems.1,2 The responsible gene for HD is the Huntingtin (HTT)
gene on chromosome 4p16.3, and aberrantly expanded CAG repeats
(translated into polyglutamine tracts) in exon 1 are closely related to
the onset and severity of HD;1,2 such abnormal expansion of the CAG
repeat results in unusual aggregation of the HTT protein, which is
harmful to neurons in the brain. Currently, there is no deﬁnitive treatment for HD, and many efforts have been made to develop better
treatments for HD.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21- to 23-nt-long small noncoding RNAs,
which are processed from longer transcripts (primary miRNAs)
forming a hairpin structure by digestion with a microprocessor com-

plex containing Drosha and DGCR8 in the nucleus and Dicer in
the cytoplasm.3 After processing, miRNAs are incorporated into the
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and function as mediators
in gene silencing,3 which targets mRNAs partially or nearly complementary to the miRNAs. miRNAs play important roles in gene regulation through the gene silencing.
Thousands of miRNA genes have been found in animals and plants
(see the microRNA database [miRBase]: http://www.mirbase.org/
index.shtml). Expression proﬁles of miRNAs have been examined,
and tissue- and stage-speciﬁc expression of miRNAs and diseaseassociated expression of miRNAs have been detected.4–10 Thus,
miRNAs may become useful biomarkers and may provide us with
clues to help better disease treatment.9–11 Regarding miRNA expression in the brain, a major change in the expression of miRNAs occurs
during the ﬁrst month of mouse life,12 which corresponds to the stage
of rapid brain development. Such controlled expression of miRNAs
presumably contributes to normal brain formation and maturation,
and abnormal expression of miRNAs due to diseases may cause
harmful effects on brain formation.
Disease-causing mutant HTT proteins adversely affect biomolecules
such as proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs in the HD brain. In this study,
we examined miRNA expression in the brain of R6/2 (HD-model)
mice and wild-type mice, and found that miR-132 was markedly
decreased in HD mice relative to wild-type mice. Previous studies

suggested that miR-132 is a key miRNA involved in neuronal maturation and function.13–15 Based on the ﬁndings, we conducted a therapeutic trial to reduce the shortage of miR-132 in the HD brains by
supplying miR-132 using an AAV miRNA expression system in this
study, and we showed symptomatic improvement in motor function
and lifespan of treated HD mice without suppressing disease-causing
mutant HTTs.

The expression of miR-132 was examined in detail by means of qRTPCR, because a major change in miRNA expression occurs in the
mouse brain during the ﬁrst month after birth.12 The resultant
expression proﬁles exhibited that the post-natal miR-132 of HD
mice was expressed in the same manner as wild-type mice, but
soon reached a plateau at lower levels than wild-type mice (Figure 1B).
Consequently, a signiﬁcant decrease in miR-132 levels occurred in
HD mouse brains.
In addition to the ﬁndings, we investigated miR-132 levels in various
tissues of HD and wild-type mice (Figure S2), and also in human HD
lymphoblastoid cell lines (Figure S3). Although the miR-132 expression levels of the examined tissues were signiﬁcantly lower than
that of the brain, the decreasing trend of the miR-132 level in HD
as compared with normal controls appeared to be kept in the tissues
examined except for the liver and kidney.
Decrease in miR-132 Associated with Ago2

To see whether miR-132 deﬁciency affected miR-132-involved gene
silencing, we investigated miR-132 associated with Argonaute 2
(Ago2), which is an essential protein having endonuclease activity
according to miRNA in the RISC.3 First we examined striatal Ago2
in HD and wild-type mice by western blotting. As a result, Ago2
had little difference between the two mice (Figure 2A), suggesting
that there might be no difference in the ability of Ago2 itself between
HD and wild-type mice. We then investigated miR-132 associated
with Ago2. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Ago2 antibodies followed
by qRT-PCR to detect miRNAs in immunoprecipitates was carried
out (Figures 2B–2D). miR-132, -125a,b, and -128 were examined,
and in this assay, miR-125b was used as an internal control because
miR-125b levels were nearly similar between HD and wild-type
mice (Figures 2C and 2D). The results indicated that the level of
miR-132 associated with Ago2 in HD mice was markedly lower
than that in wild-type mice (Figure 2D). In addition, miR-125a
and -128 associated with Ago2 as well decreased in HD mice
relative to wild-type mice (Figure 2D). Therefore, a decrease in
miR-132, -125a, and -128 may confer a decrease in their gene silencing
activities.
Expression of the Target Genes of miR-132

RESULTS
miR-132 Deficiency in the Brain of HD Mice

We investigated miRNA expression in the striatum, a major HD
focus, of R6/2 (HD-model) and wild-type mice by means of DNA
chip technology, and found that miR-132 and its adjacent, analogous
miR-21213,16 were markedly decreased in HD mice relative to wildtype mice (Table 1); note that miR-212 was considerably less than
miR-132 (Figure S1). The results were conﬁrmed by northern blotting
as well (Figure 1A), and the ﬁndings were consistent with previous
studies:17,18 another HD model of YAC128 mice expressing
full-length mutant HTT mRNAs showed a decrease in miR-132 in
the brain,17 and more noteworthy, Johnson et al.18 indicated that
miR-132 levels were decreased in post-mortem brains of HD patients.
Thus, there may be some association between miR-132 and HD.

Molecular Therapy: Nucleic Acids Vol. 11 June 2018

We examined the following miR-132 target genes: Methyl-CpG
binding protein 2 (MeCP2),19 Rho GTPase activating protein 32
(p250GAP),20–22 Polypyrimidine tract binding protein 2 (Ptbp2),23
and Regulatory factor X4 (Rfx4).24 The protein levels of striatal
MeCP2, p250GAP, Ptbp2, and Rfx4 were examined by western blotting. Compared with wild-type mice, MeCP2 and Ptbp2 of HD mice
increased, whereas p250GAP decreased, and Rfx4 appeared to slightly
decrease in HD mice (Figure 3A). The mRNA levels of Ptbp2 and Rfx4
showed little difference between HD and wild-type mice, whereas
MeCP2 slightly increased in HD mice, and p250GAP decreased (Figure 3B). Based on the principle of miRNA-mediated gene silencing, a
decrease in miRNAs should result in an increase in their target gene
products. Accordingly, MeCP2 and Ptbp2 might be candidate genes
that are affected by the shortage of miR-132 in the brain. The protein

examined and analyzed by a delta Ct (threshold cycle) method using the level of U6 snoRNA as a control. The normalized miRNA levels were further normalized by the level
obtained in WT mice at post-natal day 2 as 1. Data are shown as mean ± SEM (n = 4 individual mice).

level of p250GAP appears to directly reﬂect its mRNA level, and Rfx4
may be similar as well.
miR-132 Supplement into the Brain of HD Mice

Because previous studies suggested that miR-132 made an important
contribution to neuronal function and maturation,14,15,21,25 we conducted therapeutic trials to see what would happen to HD mice if
miR-132 were supplied to the HD brains. To compensate for the
shortage of miR-132 in HD brains, we constructed a viral miR132-expression system using recombinant adeno-associated viruses
(rAAVs). The constructed miR-132-expression viruses (AAV9_
miR-132) and negative-control viruses (AAV9_miR-Neg) were introduced into the striatum of z3-week-old HD and wild-type mice (Figure 4A); that age was when the marked difference in miR-132 levels
began to appear between the mice (Figure 1B). After virus inoculation, miR-132 levels were examined and conﬁrmed to return to
normal levels in the striatum of AAV9_miR-132-treated HD mice

(Figure 4B). Consistently, the level of miR-132 associated with
Ago2 markedly increased in AAV9_miR-132-treated HD and wildtype mice (Figure 4C). An increase in miR-132 was also detected in
the cerebral cortex and the midbrain of the AAV9_miR-132-treated
HD mice. This was probably due to the diffusion of AAV9_miR132 viruses (Figure S4).
MeCP2 and Ptbp2, which are candidates of miR-132 targets (Figure 4D), were examined. As a result, the MeCP2 protein was reduced
in AAV9_miR-132-treated mice without a decrease in MeCP2 mRNA
levels (Figure S5A), compared with AAV9_miR-Neg-treagted mice.
Note that the decrease in MeCP2 was seen in both AAV9_miR132-treated wild-type and HD mice. In contrast, the Ptbp2 gene products appeared to remain unchanged between AAV9_miR-132-treated
and AAV9_miR-Neg-treated mice (Figure 4D; Figure S5B). Thus, the
ﬁndings suggest that MeCP2 may be a target gene of miR-132 in the
brain.

Symptomatic Improvement of Motor Function and Lifespan in
AAV9_miR-132-Treated HD Mice

Because R6/2 mice are well known as a fulminant HD-model animal
suffering from severe motor deﬁcits and rapidly declining locomotor
activity,26,27 we investigated the behavior and longevity of AAV9_
miR-132-treated HD mice and also AAV9_miR-Neg-treated HD
mice (as controls). Interestingly enough, miR-132 supplementation
produced symptomatic improvement, i.e., rotarod and open-ﬁeld
test showed a deﬁnite amelioration in AAV9_miR-132-treated HD
mice (Figure 5A; Figure S6). Moreover, AAV9_miR-132-treated

HD represent individual mice examined. Gapdh was examined as an internal
control. In mRNA analysis, the mRNA levels of the target genes were normalized
to the level of Gapdh as an internal control and further normalized to the level obtained from WT mice as 1 (blue bars). Data are shown as mean ± SEM (n = 3 individual mice, **p < 0.01 by Student’s t test).

HD mice showed a signiﬁcant life prolongation relative to AAV9_
miR-Neg-treated HD mice (Figure 5B) and also exhibited a slight
increase in body weight (Figure S6D). Therefore, the ﬁndings strongly
suggested that miR-132 recovery was effective in improving motor
function of HD mice and prolonging their life, or effective in slow disease progression in HD mice.
Regarding AAV9_miR-132-treated wild-type mice, miR-132
exceeding normal levels was expressed in the brain (Figures 4B and
4C), but there was little or no difference in behavior and longevity between AAV9_miR-132-treated and AAV9_miR-Neg-treated wildtype mice (Figure 5). In addition, no signiﬁcant change had been
observed afterward. Thus, it is possible that a deﬁciency of miR-132
may have a major impact on the life of the mouse, but a surplus of
miR-132 may not have.

(A) Histological examination. AAV9_miR-132 and AAV9_miR-Neg as a control were injected into both sides of the striatum of HD and wild-type (WT) mice aged 3 weeks.
AAV9_miR-Neg expresses a short hairpin RNA just as a regular pre-miRNA, but is predicted not to target any known gene. Four weeks after injection, the brains were
isolated, fixed with 4% PFA at 4 C overnight, and subjected to brain slicing (coronal section, approximately 1 mm thick). The brain slices were stained with propidium iodide,
and the signals of propidium iodide (red) and the GFP reporter protein (green) derived from the AAV9 vectors were examined by a fluorescence stereo microscope. Two
individual mice in each treated group were examined. (B) The expression levels of miR-132 in the striatum of the treated HD and WT mice at the age of 7 weeks (4 weeks after
administration) were examined by qRT-PCR as in Figure 1B. The data were normalized to the level obtained from WT mice treated with AAV9_miR-Neg as 1 (n = 4 individual
mice; *p < 0.05 by Tukey-Kramer test). Data are shown as mean ± SEM. (C) miR-132 associated with Ago2. HD and WT mice treated with AAV9_miR-132 and AAV9_miRNeg were examined as in (B). Immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-Ago2 antibodies and miRNA analysis were performed as in Figure 2. The miR-132 levels normalized to the
miR-125b levels were further normalized to the levels obtained from AAV9_miR-Neg-treated WT mice as 1 (gray bars). The experiment was duplicated (Exp 1 and 2). Data are
shown as mean ± SEM (n = 3 measurements). (D) MeCP2 and Ptbp2 expression. The MeCP2 and Ptbp2 proteins in the striatum of HD and WT mice treated with AAV9_miR132 (miR-132) and AAV9_miR-Neg (miR-Neg) were examined by western blotting as in Figure 3. Gapdh was examined as an internal control.

From the ﬁndings, we raised the working hypothesis that miR-132
supplement might suppress the expression of disease-causing mutant
HTTs and be capable of eliminating harmful mutant HTTs from
the HD brain. To address the hypothesis, we examined mutant
HTT expression by RT-semiquantitative PCR. As a result, the mutant
HTT level hardly changed between AAV9_miR-132-treated and

AAV9_miR-Neg-treated HD mice (Figure 6). We further performed
an immunohistochemical analysis for detection of mutant HTT inclusion bodies that are characteristic of HD.28 The results indicated
that there was no signiﬁcant difference in formation of inclusion
bodies between AAV9_miR-132-treated and AAV9_miR-Negtreated HD mice (Figure 7A). Western blot analysis of the striatum

by log rank test).

also exhibited a compatible result: there was little difference in mutant
HTT between AAV9_miR-132-treated and AAV9_miR-Neg-treated
HD mice (Figure S7). In addition, consistent results were obtained
from in vitro experiments as well using primary neurons co-expressed
with exogenous mutant HTT and miR-132 (Figure 7B). Consequently,
these unexpected ﬁndings suggested that miR-132 supplementation
had little effect on the expression of mutant HTTs and their inclusion
body formation in HD mice supplemented with miR-132.

DISCUSSION
Supplemental miRNA Therapy

Inhibition of disease-causing genes or elimination of mutant gene
products is a straightforward and ideal approach for the treatment
of intractable diseases caused by dominant-negative disease-causing
genes such as mutant HTT genes in HD. Speciﬁc inhibition of disease-causing genes carrying nucleotide variations may be feasible by
speciﬁc silencing such as disease-causing allele-speciﬁc RNAi;29–32
however, RNAi may be difﬁcult to eliminate disease-causing gene
products thoroughly from patients’ cells. For ﬁghting against intractable diseases, it is necessary to develop other treatment approaches

based on mechanisms of action different from conventional approaches, even if such approaches had the only effect of symptomatic
relief. Our current study offers the suggestion that miRNAs may open
up a new way of treatment for HD, i.e., miRNA supplemental therapy.
In the current study, we focused on miR-132 that markedly decreased
in the brain of HD mice (Table 1; Figure 1). Our therapeutical trial
using miR-132-expression AAVs showed that miR-132 supplement
for reducing the deﬁciency of miR-132 in the HD brains conferred
amelioration in motor function and lifespan of HD mice (Figure 5).
In addition, it is noteworthy that miR-132 supplement hardly affected
disease-causing HTT genes and their gene products (Figures 6 and 7;
Figure S7); i.e., such a symptomatic improvement was gained without
suppressing and/or eliminating harmful mutant HTTs. The ﬁndings
provided us with a new insight into the treatment strategy for HD;
that is, there may be a therapeutic approach to HD without inhibiting
disease-causing mutant HTTs.
On a relevant note, Benraiss et al.33 recently demonstrated that a striatal transplantation of normal human glia into the brain of R6/2 mice
resulted in amelioration in the HD phenotype without inﬂuencing
mutant HTTs, and another recent study in which 589,306 human
genomes were analyzed indicated that there were healthy individuals
possessing highly penetrant, deleterious disease-causing alleles.34
These ﬁndings surprised us and suggested that there may be a mechanism(s) by which deleterious effects caused by harmful mutations
would be alleviated without wiping out the mutations. Therefore,
these studies and also our study suggested that there might be a therapeutic way to treat intractable diseases without inhibiting and/or
repairing disease-causing genes and gene products.

were examined 4 weeks after AAV9 administration as in
Figure 4A. Sagittal brain sections were prepared and
subjected to fluorescent immunostaining with anti-GFP
and anti-HTT antibodies and counterstaining with
Hoechst 33342. Arrowheads indicate inclusion bodies
observed in GFP-positive cells (AAV9-infected cells).
The GFP-positive cells containing inclusion bodies were
counted in three different fields of view (a field of view =
247 mm  247 mm) per individual mice. Data are shown
as mean ± SEM (n = 3 mice) in the bar graph. n.s., no
significant difference. (B) Inclusion bodies in neuronal cells
supplemented with miR-132. Cultured neurons were
transfected with pMiR-132 or pMiR-Neg, both of which
encode the GFP reporter gene, together with pDsRed-QWt (normal HTT) or pDsRed-Q-Mt (mutant HTT). Two
days after transfection, the cells were fixed and stained
with Hoechst 33342. Inclusion bodies (indicated by arrowheads) were detected only in cells transfected with
pDsRed-Q-Mt. The percentage of inclusion body-positive
cells in GFP-positive cells was examined. Data are shown
as mean ± SEM (n = 13 and 16 GFP-positive cells in
pMiR-Neg and pMiR-132 transfection, respectively). n.s.,
no statistical difference by Student’s t test.

This new strategy may further expand the versatility of the treatment
approach to other diseases. Downregulation of miR-132/miR-212 was
also detected in the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s disease35–37
and schizophrenia,38 other than HD.18 Therefore, miR-132 supplement might be available and effective for the cure of such diseases
in which miR-132 is deﬁcient, whatever the causative disease genes.
In conclusion, although miR-132 supplementation may not be a
deﬁnitive therapy for HD, it may become an adjunctive therapy for
HD, which may help to delay the onset of disease and the progression
of disease.
The current study has left a challenge; i.e., the mechanism of improvement by suppling miR-132 to the HD brain remains unknown. The
AAV9_miR-132 virus appears to supply enough miR-132 to compensate for miR-132 deﬁciency in the HD brain (Figure 4), and the supplied miR-132 can associate with Ago2 (Figure 4C) and probably
function properly. As a result, symptomatic improvement would be
brought to HD mice (Figure 5). miR-132-mediated gene silencing
would recover after AAV9_miR-132 virus inoculation and MeCP2
as a target of miR-132 appeared to undergo translation inhibition.
McFarland et al.39 indicated that the association of Htt with MeCP2
increased in knock-in Hdh mice (another HD model), suggesting
that abnormal interaction between Htt and MeCP2 may cause transcriptional dysregulation. Based on the previous study, an increase
in MeCP2 in R6/2 mice might promote abnormal interaction between

mutant HTT and MeCP2; thus, the decrease in MeCP2 by miR-132
supplement might reduce the aberrant interaction. As for miR-132
targets examined other than MeCP2, curiously, the relationship
with miR-132 appeared to be inconsistent with the mechanism of
miRNA-mediated gene silencing (Figure 3). In this regard, mutant
HTTs might have some effect on certain miR-132 target mRNAs in
HD mice. In any case, there is little information on the mechanism
of action for amelioration of HD symptoms when miR-132 is supplied
to miR-132-deﬁcient HD mice. As a clue to the solution, authentic
target genes, like MeCP2, that respond to miR-132 in HD mice may
be the key molecules to understand the mechanism of action. Because
miR-132 is involved in various elements related to neurons such as
neuronal structure and function, it is possible that there are miR132 target genes that have not been found yet. Among such target
genes, there may be major targets contributing to amelioration in
HD mice under miR-132 supplementation. To elucidate the mechanism of action for ameliorating symptoms of HD by miR-132 supplement, more extensive studies including the identiﬁcation of major
target genes are needed and remain to be carried out.

previously.26,40 Identiﬁcation of the mutant mice was performed by
genotyping using PCR as described previously.26,40 Our sequence
analysis of the PCR products indicated that the mutant mice maintained approximately 124 CAG repeats in the HTT exon1. Mice
were housed, fed, and maintained in the laboratory animal facility according to the National Institute of Neuroscience animal care guidelines. All the animal experiments were performed in strict accordance
with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Neuroscience. The
protocols were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal
Experiments of the National Institutes of Neuroscience (Permit
Number: 2015003).
DNA Oligonucleotides

DNA oligonucleotides used in this study were synthesized by and
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
miRNA Expression Profile Analysis

Total RNAs were extracted from the striatum of 10-week-old R6/2
mouse (male) and littermate wild-type mouse (male). RNAs were
subjected to a comprehensive miRNA expression analysis using
3D-Gene Mouse miRNA (Ver.21) chips according to the protocols
supplied by TORAY Industries (Tokyo, Japan). Hybridization signals
were examined by a 3D-Gene Scanner 3000 followed by quantifying
with Extraction according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(TORAY). Obtained miRNA expression proﬁle data were deposited
to the GEO in NCBI.
Northern Blot

Small RNA fractions were extracted from brain subregions by a
mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Aliquots of small RNA
(z0.48 mg/each sample) were electrophoretically separated in 8 M
urea denatured (15%) polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto
positively charged nylon membranes. The membranes were hybridized with 50 -DIG-labeled miRCURY LNA miRNA detection probes
(EXIQON, Velbaek, Denmark) at 65 C for 15 hr. After washing the
membranes, the hybridized probes were detected by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
and a chemiluminescent detection system.
RT-PCR

Total RNAs were extracted from brain subregions and cultured cells
using a TRI REAGENT (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and subjected to qRT-PCR. Real-time PCR was
performed using an AB7300 Real Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) with a TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix together with TaqMan MicroRNA Assays (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TaqMan

To examine the expression of miR-132 targets, total RNA prepared from
the brain was subjected to RT with oligo (dT) primers (Promega) followed by real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was carried out using an
AB7300 Real Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) with a
FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master (Roche). PCR primers
(TAKARA BIO) used are as follows (primer set IDs are indicated in parentheses): MeCP2 (MA079473), p250GAP(Arhgap32) (MA170683),
Ptbp2 (MA168870), Rfx4 (MA110752), and Gapdh (MA050371).
Immunoprecipitation

Whole brain or striatal tissue was homogenized in 1 mL of ice-cold
lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 200 mM NaCl, 30 mM
EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.4 U/mL RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor
[Promega], 1 Protease/Phosphatase inhibitor Cocktail [CST, Danvers, MA, USA]). Lysate was centrifuged at 3,000  g for 10 min
at 4 C, and the supernatant was transferred into a new 1.5-mL
tube. The NaCl concentration in the supernatant was adjusted to
400 mM with 5 M NaCl; then a part of the supernatant was taken
and stored as a crude lysate sample. The rest was centrifuged at
70,000  g for 20 min at 4 C, and the supernatant was mixed with
yeast tRNAs (100 mg/mL ﬁnal concentration) (Sigma-Aldrich) and
pretreated with 40 mL of protein A-Sepharose 4B slurry (SigmaAldrich) for 30 min at 4 C. After centrifugation at 12,000  g for
2 min at 4 C, a part of the supernatant was taken and stored as an
immunoprecipitation (IP) input sample, and the remaining supernatant was divided equally. The divided samples were added with antiAGO2 IgG (2897S; CST) and a control IgG (3900S; CST), respectively, and gently mixed using a rotator overnight at 4 C. Protein
A-Sepharose 4B slurry (20 mL/each) was added to the treated samples
and incubated further for 1 hr at 4 C with gently mixing. After incubation, the protein A-Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation at 12,000  g for 2 min at 4 C, washed four times with 0.4 mL
of wash buffer 1 (the lysis buffer containing 0.04 U/mL RNasin Plus
RNase inhibitor, 10 mg/mL yeast tRNAs, and 0.1 Protease/Phosphatase inhibitor Cocktail [1:1,000; CST]), and ﬁnally washed with
0.5 mL of wash buffer 2 (the wash buffer 1 without yeast tRNAs
and RNasin Plus RNase inhibitor). RNAs co-precipitated with the
protein A-Sepharose beads were extracted with TRI REAGENT
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma-Aldrich). For
protein extraction, the beads were treated with 2 sample buffer
(125 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 2% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.02% bromophenol blue, and 10% beta-mercaptoethanol]) and boiled for 5 min
followed by centrifugation at 12,000  g for 2 min at 4 C. The

supernatant was collected and examined by western blotting using an
anti-Ago2 antibody (ab32381; Abcam).
Construction of Plasmids and Viruses
Construction of miR-132 Expression Plasmid and Virus

Synthetic oligoDNA duplex that encodes the miR-132 gene was inserted into pcDNA 6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR expression vector using a
BLOCK-iT Pol II miR RNAi Expression Vector Kit with EmGFP
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The sequences of the miR-132 oligoDNAs inserted into the
vector are indicated in Table S1. The constructed plasmid, named
pMiR-132, carries miR-132 in the 30 UTR of the GFP reporter gene.
The pcDNA 6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR-neg control plasmid provided
by the manufacturer was used as a negative control and named
pMiR-Neg in this study. The pMiR-Neg plasmid encodes a short
hairpin RNA just as a regular pre-miRNA, but the hairpin RNA is
predicted not to target any known vertebrate gene.
For construction of expression viruses, the GFP reporter genes containing miR-132 and miR-neg in pMiR-132 and pMiR-Neg, respectively, were ampliﬁed by PCR using a PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase with GC buffer (TAKARA BIO) and PCR primers. The sequences
of the PCR primers used are indicated in Table S1. The PCR products
were puriﬁed by a PCR & Gel puriﬁcation kit (BEX, Itabashi-ku,
Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and subjected to ligation with pW-CAG-EGFP-WPRE vector digested with
EcoRI and BamHI, using an In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (TAKARA
BIO) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resultant
pW-CAG-EGFP-WPRE vectors containing miR-132 or miR-Neg
were packed into recombinant adeno-associated viruses based on
serotype 9 (rAAV-9) as described previously.41 The rAAV-9 viruses
encoding miR-132 and miR-Neg, named AAV9_miR-132 and
AAV9_miR-Neg, respectively, were used in this study.
HTT Expression Plasmids

The pEGFP-Q22 and pEGFP-Q145 plasmids that encode normal
(22 CAG repeats) and abnormal (145 CAG repeats) HTT exon1 sequences, respectively, were used.42 In the plasmids, the HTT exon1
is fused with the EGFP reporter gene. We further constructed
pDsRed-Q-Wt and pDsRed-Q-Mt plasmids, which encoded the
normal and abnormal HTT exon1, respectively. In the plasmids, the
HTT exon1 is fused with the DsRed-monomer gene derived from
pDsRed-monomer vector (TAKARA BIO).
Primary Cortical Neuron and Astrocyte Culture

Mouse primary neuronal cells were prepared and cultured. In brief,
mouse embryonic day 17 (E17) embryonic cerebral tissue (ICR mouse
strain) was isolated, treated with 0.5% trypsin-EDTA solution containing 0.1 mg/mL DNase I (Roche) and 5 mg/mL glucose at 37 C
for 20 min, dissociated by pipetting several times, and passed through
a 70-mm nylon ﬁlter (DB, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The dissociated
neuronal cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated
culture plates (a cell density of 4  103 cells/mm2) and cultured at
37 C in Neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) supple-

mented with 1% FBS (Life Technologies), 2% B27 supplement
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), 1 mM glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), and
10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 5% CO2 humidiﬁed
chamber. For astrocyte separation, 1-week-cultured cells were trypsinized and then sub-cultured on normal tissue culture plates (cell
density of 4  103 cells/mm2) in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc), and 1 antibiotics (25 mg/L streptomycin and
50 U/mL penicillin; Wako, Chuo-ku, Osaka, Japan). Cells were grown
at 37 C in a 5% CO2 humidiﬁed chamber, and sequential passage of
the cells was performed.
Isolation of Lymphocytes from Mice Blood

Whole blood of mice was collected by cardiac puncture using a 26Gneedle syringe containing 0.1 mL of 10 mg/mL EDTA. The blood
samples were transferred into 15-mL tubes and mixed with 10 mL
of RBC lysis buffer (10 mM NH4HCO3, 144 mM NH4Cl). Lymphocytes were collected by centrifugation at 1,600  g for 10 min. Cells
were washed four times with RBC lysis buffer and subjected to
RNA extraction using a TRI REAGENT (Sigma-Aldrich).
Lymphoblastoid Cell Culture

Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human lymphoblastoid cell lines
were cultured at 37 C in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS (Japan Bio Serum, Fukuyama, Hiroshima,
Japan), 110 mg/L sodium pyruvate (Wako), 4,500 mg/L D-glucose
(Wako), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc) in a 5% CO2 humidiﬁed chamber.
Intracranial Injection of rAAV Vectors

R6/2 and wild-type mice at post-natal day z21 were anesthetized
with somnopentyl (50 mg/kg body weight [b.w.]), and 2 mL of
AAV9_miR-132 or AAV9_miR-Neg was stereotaxically injected
into both sides of the striatum (z1 mm anterior to bregma,
z2 mm lateral to the midline, z3 mm ventral to the skull surface)
using a Hamilton Neuros Syringe (HAMILTON, Reno, NV, USA).
Transfection

Transfection of plasmid DNAs into primary cultured cells was carried
out by a Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Before transfection,
culture medium was replaced with serum-free culture medium
(Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 supplement,
1 mM glutamine, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated for
2 hr at 37 C in a 5% CO2 humidiﬁed chamber. After incubation,
plasmid DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixtures were added into the
cells. Four hours after transfection, medium was replaced with fresh,
complete culture medium containing FBS.
Rotarod Test

Rotarod test was carried out to see the motor coordination of mice,
using an Ugo Basile Rota-Rod 47600 (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy).
The apparatus was programmed to accelerate its rod rotation from
4 to 40 rpm during 300 s. Time from when mouse was put onto the

rod of the apparatus until when the mouse fell off or cling on to
the rod was recorded. Mice were subjected to three trials per day
between 2:00 and 7:00 p.m., and the test was performed for the third
straight day.
Open Field Locomotors Activity and Rearing Frequency

Spontaneous locomotor activity and rearing frequency of mice
were examined. Mice were placed in a monitoring box (40 cm 
28 cm  31 cm) (SUPERMEX; Muromachi Kikai, Tokyo, Japan)
equipped with an activity sensor (Pyroelectric sensor PYS-001; Muromachi Kikai) and a rearing sensor (MRS-110TX-RX; Muromachi
Kikai) at the top and wall of the box, respectively. Locomotor activity
and rearing frequency of a mouse in the box were simultaneously
measured for 15 min, and the test was performed between 2:00
and 7:00 p.m. The obtained data were analyzed by a Data Collection
Program CompACT AMS Ver.3 (Muromachi Kikai).
SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting

Cultured cells and brain samples were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM
Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100)
containing 1 protease inhibitor cocktail (Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
Tablets; Roche). The lysate was homogenized with a pestle and centrifuged at 3,000  g for 10 min at 4 C and then further centrifuged at
14,000  g for 15 min at 4 C. The resultant supernatant was collected,
and protein concentration was measured by a Protein Quantiﬁcation
kit (DOJINDO, Mashiki-town, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Equal amounts of protein (z40 mg)
were mixed with 4 sample buffer (0.25 M Tris-HCl, 40% glycerol,
8% SDS, 0.04% bromophenol blue, 8% beta-mercaptoethanol), boiled
for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE with 10% polyacrylamide
gels. After separation, proteins were electrophoretically blotted
onto polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes (Immobilon P; Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked for 1 hr in blocking solution (5% BSA [Sigma-Aldrich] in TBS-T buffer [Tris-buffered
saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20]) and incubated with diluted
primary antibodies (indicated below) at 4 C overnight. After incubation, the membranes were washed in TBS-T buffer and incubated
with 1/5,000 diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (SigmaAldrich), or with 1/500 diluted VerBlot for IP secondary antibody
(HRP) (ab131366; Abcam) for 1 hr at room temperature. Antigenantibody complexes were visualized using Immobilon Western
Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore). The primary antibodies used, as well as their dilution ratios including IDs and manufactures in parentheses, are as follows: anti-AGO2 (1:1,000; 2897;
CST), anti-MeCP2 (1:1,000; 3456; CST), anti-Ptbp2 (1:1,000;
ab154787; Abcam), anti-RFX4 (1:1,000; LS-C109967; LSBio,
Seattle, WA, USA), anti-Gapdh (1:1,000; 2118; CST), anti-HTT
(1/300; MAB5374; Millipore), anti-alpha-tubulin (1/10,000; F2168,
Sigma-Aldrich), anti-MAP2 (1:1,000; ab32454; Abcam), anti-GFAP
(1:1,000; G3893; Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-p250GAP antibodies
(1:5,000) that were kindly provided by Dr. T. Nakazawa (Osaka
University).43,44 Anti-Ago2 (1:1,000, ab32381; Abcam) was used for
detection of Ago2 in IP samples.

Fluorescence Immunocytochemistry and
Immunohistochemistry

Cultured cells were rinsed with PBS, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) in PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X in PBS for 5 min
at room temperature and incubated in blocking solution (5% BSA
[Sigma-Aldrich] and 5% goat serum [Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, USA]) for 1 hr at room temperature. The treated cells
were incubated with diluted primary antibodies (indicated below) in
PBS at 4 C overnight. After washed with PBS, antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by isotype-speciﬁc secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes, CA, USA).
In addition, nuclear staining was also carried out with 2 mg/mL
Hoechst33342 (Cell Signaling Technology) or 2 mg/mL propidium
iodide (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) in PBS. Stained cells were examined
using a ZEISS ﬂuorescent microscope (Axiovert 40 CFL).
For immunohistochemical analysis, dissected brain tissues were ﬁxed
with 4% PFA in PBS at 4 C overnight, incubated in 20% sucrose in
PBS at 4 C overnight, embedded in O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetech Japan, Koto-ku, Tokyo, Japan) on a dry ice/ethanol bath, and
then cut into 15-mm-thick sections. Cryosections were treated in
blocking/permeabilization buffer (0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% goat
serum in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature and incubated with
diluted primary antibodies (indicated below) in PBS containing
0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum at 4 C overnight. After
washing with PBS, the sections were incubated with isotype-speciﬁc
secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 or Alexa 594
(Molecular Probes), and examined using a Leica confocal ﬂuorescent
microscope (Leica TCS SP2). Nuclei were also stained with
Hoechst33342 and examined. The primary antibodies used, as well
as their dilution ratios including IDs and manufactures in parentheses, are as follows: anti-HTT (1/200, MAB5374; Millipore) and antiGFP (1/500, A11122; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
Statistical Analysis

Data obtained in this study were initially evaluated by one-way
ANOVA. If signiﬁcant difference between data was detected by
ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc test was carried out between the data of
interest. The level of statistical signiﬁcance was set at 0.05.
