During brain development, neuronal activity suppresses apoptosis and promotes survival of neurons, adjusting neuronal
population to its connection patterns. The role of the NMDA
subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDAR)5 supporting neuronal survival during CNS development is well documented, and
it has been reported that basal NMDAR activity suppresses
neuronal apoptosis in the somatosensory thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the dentate gyrus and in CA1 in the hippocampus, among other brain areas (1–3). The trophic effect of
NMDAR stimulation is especially necessary for the survival and
differentiation of cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) (4).
CGCs are generated during the postnatal development of the
cerebellum in the external granule layer and migrate to the
internal granule layer to become mature CGCs (5, 6). During its
migration, they need glutamatergic stimulation from the mossy
fibers. The stimulation of NMDAR is necessary for the maintenance of these neurons during cerebellum development (7–9).
Failure to receive mossy fiber inputs will drive CGCs to apoptotic death (10, 11). This scenario can be mimicked in vitro in
primary cultures of CGCs. When these neurons are grown in
low potassium concentration (5 mM KCl; K5), they undergo
spontaneous apoptosis. Nevertheless, they will develop and
survive in the presence of high potassium concentrations (25
mM KCl; K25) or NMDA (4, 12, 13).
It has been widely reported that the activation of survival
signaling kinases, including Akt and ERK (14, 15), and the suppression of proapoptotic kinases, such as glycogen synthase
kinase-3␤ (GSK-3␤) or JNK (16, 17), are involved in neuronal
survival. The regulation of these kinases modulates the activity
of some transcription factors that control the expression of proand antiapoptotic genes. In CGCs, NMDA-mediated prosur5

NMDA receptor (NMDAR) stimulation promotes neuronal survival during brain development. Cerebellar granule cells (CGCs)
need NMDAR stimulation to survive and develop. These neurons
differentiate and mature during its migration from the external
granular layer to the internal granular layer, and lack of excitatory
inputs triggers their apoptotic death. It is possible to mimic this
process in vitro by culturing CGCs in low KCl concentrations (5
mM) in the presence or absence of NMDA. Using this experimental
approach, we have obtained whole genome expression profiles
after 3 and 8 h of NMDA addition to identify genes involved in
NMDA-mediated survival of CGCs. One of the identified genes was
Nurr1, a member of the orphan nuclear receptor subfamily Nr4a.
Our results report a direct regulation of Nurr1 by CREB after
NMDAR stimulation. ChIP assay confirmed CREB binding to
Nurr1 promoter, whereas CREB shRNA blocked NMDA-mediated
increase in Nurr1 expression. Moreover, we show that Nurr1 is
important for NMDAR survival effect. We show that Nurr1 binds
to Bdnf promoter IV and that silencing Nurr1 by shRNA leads to a
decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels and a reduction of NMDA neuroprotective effect. Also, we
report that Nurr1 and BDNF show a similar expression pattern
during postnatal cerebellar development. Thus, we conclude that
Nurr1 is a downstream target of CREB and that it is responsible for
the NMDA-mediated increase in BDNF, which is necessary for the
NMDA-mediated prosurvival effect on neurons.

Nurr1 Mediates CGCs Survival by NMDA
vival effect seems to be dependent on the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway (13, 18) and the
activation of CREB (19). Other transcription factors, for example MEF2, FKHRL1, DeltaNp73, or Sp1/3, have also been
reported to be involved in neuronal survival (20 –23). However,
whether these or other factors are involved in the signaling
related to the NMDAR-mediated prosurvival effect is still
poorly understood.
In the present study, we have analyzed the expression
changes in response to NMDA treatment in cultured CGCs. By
comparative analysis, we have identified Nurr1 as a candidate
to mediate the NMDAR prosurvival response. In fact, we report
that NMDA induction of CREB activation promotes Nurr1
expression and consequent up-regulation of its protein levels.
In addition, silencing of Nurr1 results in a reduction in brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels that correlates with
the decrease in the NMDA-mediated neuroprotection in these
cells.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Culture—Granule cell cultures were prepared from dissociated cerebella of 8-day-old Wistar rats as described previously (4). Cells were plated (3 ⫻ 103 cells/mm2) in Eagle’s basal
medium (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5 or 25 mM KCl (K5, K25) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Sigma-Aldrich), 25,000 units of penicillin, and 25 mg of streptomycin (PAN Biotech Inc.). 10 ␮M cytosine-␤-D-arabinofuranoside was added to the cultures 24 h after plating to prevent proliferation of non-neuronal cells. Neurons were plated
onto poly-L-lysine coated 48-well plates for measurement of
cell viability and immunocytochemistry, on 35-mm culture
dishes for RNA extraction and Western blotting, on 24-well
plates for luciferase assays, and on 100-mm plates for ChIP
assays. At 2 days in vitro (DIV), K5 neurons were treated or not
with NMDA (100 ␮M, Sigma-Aldrich) or K25. The procedures
followed were in accordance with guidelines of the Comissió
d’Ètica en l’Experimentació Animal i Humana of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.
Cell Viability—Neuronal viability was assessed using the
3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cells were incubated with MTT (0.2 mg/ml)
for 45 min at 37 °C. The blue formazan derivative was solubilized in 100 ␮l of dimethyl sulfoxide, and the dual wavelength
was measured at 560 and 620 nm in a Labsystems Multiskan
plate reader. Data are presented as mean ⫾ S.E. of values
obtained from three or four independent experiments performed in triplicates.
Fluorescence Analysis of Apoptotic Nuclei—Apoptosis was
assessed by nuclear DNA staining with Hoechst 33258. Cells
were washed twice in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) 24 h after the
treatment, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 45 min at 4 °C, and stained with 1 ␮g/ml
Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes) for 5 min after being washed
again twice in TBS. Nuclear DNA staining was observed with an
inverted microscope (Nikon eclipse TE-2000-E). In every
experiment, more than 1000 cells were individually examined
for each experimental condition. Condensed and/or fragmented nuclei were considered as apoptotic nuclei. Data are

given as mean ⫾ S.E. of values obtained in three or four independent experiments performed in triplicate. Results are
expressed as the percentage of apoptotic nuclei versus total
nuclei.
Immunoblotting—CGC cultures were washed with PBS, and
total protein was extracted by incubating neurons in lysis buffer
containing 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl,
5 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 10 ␮g/ml aprotinin, 20 ␮g/ml leupeptin, 1 mM activated orthovanadate. Cell lysates were sonicated for 1 min. Proteins (25 ␮g) were resolved in 10% SDSPAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
(Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were washed with PBS/
Tween (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h in
blocking buffer (5% of nonfat dry milk in PBS/Tween except
10% of nonfat dry milk for Nurr1 and supplemented with 5%
FBS for BDNF) at room temperature to block nonspecific binding. Blots were washed and incubated overnight at 4 °C with
primary antibodies against CREB, phospho-Ser133-CREB, and
Nur77 from Cell Signaling; Nurr1 and NOR-1 from Abcam;
BDNF from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; GAPDH from Ambion
Inc.; and actin from Sigma-Aldrich, diluted (1:1000 for all,
except GAPDH and actin 1:40,000) in blocking buffer or PBS/
Tween with 0.1% BSA and 2% nonfat dry milk for BDNF. Blots
were then washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(BD Biosciences) diluted 1:3000 in blocking buffer. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECLTM Western blotting
detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden)
and quantified by a computer-assisted densitometer. Actin and
GAPDH were used as loading controls.
Immunohistochemistry—Cerebella of P9, P14, P26, and adult
rats were fixed for 24 h with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at
4 °C and embedded in paraffin. 5-␮m sections were processed
for Nurr1 labeling. Briefly, sections were rehydrated and
washed twice in TBS. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inactivated with 3% H2O2 in TBS. After extensive washes with TBS/
Tween (TBS with 0.5% Tween), the sections were incubated in
blocking solution (TBS/Tween with 10% FBS). Subsequently,
the sections were exposed to Nurr1 antibody (1:200 in blocking
solution; Abcam) for at least 12 h at 4 °C. The sections were
again rinsed extensively in TBS/Tween and incubated with
anti-mouse antibody coupled to biotin (1:200 in blocking solution; Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. After
rinsing, the sections were incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase in TBS (1:300; Vector laboratories). Peroxidase was developed with 0.05% diaminobenzidine in TBS and 0.035% H2O2
solution. Nuclei were stained by incubation with hematoxylin
for 1 min. Sections were dehydrated and covered with DPX
medium. Pictures were obtained in a NIKON Eclipse 901
microscope/Nikon digital sight camera, using 2⫻, 10⫻, 20⫻,
and 40⫻ objective lens.
Gene Expression Analysis—CGCs were plated in K5 and
treated or not at 2 DIV with NMDA (100 ␮M). After 3 and 8 h,
RNA extraction was done with the RNeasy威 Protect kit (Qiagen), and samples were sent to the genomic service of the
Vall d’Hebron Hospital Research Institute to perform the
Affymetrix Rat Genome 430 2.0 array. Expression data were
obtained using the GCOS software and normalized with robust

AAACTTTATCGGAtctcttgaaTCCGATAAAGTTTTTCGCTggg. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen and were
cloned between BglII/HindIII sites of pSUPER.retro.puro plasmid.
Lentiviral constructs were achieved by digesting EcoRI-ClaI sites
from pSUPER-sh to replace H1 promoter with H1-shRNA cassette in pLVTHM.
Lentiviruses were propagated using methods described previously (24) (25). Briefly, human embryonic kidney 293T
(HEK293T) cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 ⫻ 106 cells in
100-mm dishes. The following day, cells were transfected with
20 ␮g of pLVTHM-derived constructs, 15 ␮g of pSPAX2, and 8
␮g of pMD2G. The transfection was routinely performed by the
calcium phosphate transfection method (26). Cells were
allowed to produce lentiviruses for 48 h. After 48 h, the medium
was centrifuged at 1200 ⫻ g for 5 min, and the supernatant was
concentrated at 141,000 ⫻ g for 120 min and then resuspended
in 50 ␮l of PBS containing 1% BSA and stored at ⫺80 °C. Biological titers of the viral preparations expressed as a number of
transducing units per milliliter were determined by transducing HEK293T cells in limiting dilutions. After 72 h of incubation, the percentage of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive
cells was determined by cytometer, and viruses were used in the
experiments at 1 ⫻ 106 transducing units/ml.
Lentiviral infection was performed at the day of plating. Cells
remained in contact with lentivirus for 5 h, and then medium
was replaced with Eagle’s basal medium and 5 or 25 mM KCl
supplemented with 10% FBS, 25,000 units of penicillin, and 25
mg of streptomycin. More than 75% of neurons were infected.
At 2 DIV, treatments were performed as described before, and
chromatin condensation was assessed at 7 DIV, respectively.
Cell lysates were obtained 30 h after treatment.
Plasmid Constructs—Rat genomic DNA was used as the template for PCR to amplify the Nurr1 promoter fragment, containing the CREB-response element reported in Ref. 27, with
the forward primer A (5⬘-AAGAGCTCGAGAGTTACAGTCACGGGA-3⬘) and the reverse primer B (5⬘-AACTCGAGGGCTTCAGCCGAGTGATTGG-3⬘). The fragment was cloned
into the SacI and XhoI sites of pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter
vector (pGL3-Basic) to generate plasmid pGL3-Nurr1promoter. The plasmids construct was confirmed by sequencing.
Transfection and Luciferase Assay—CGCs were plated and
infected with the indicated lentivirus, and at 1 DIV, they were
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with pGL3Basic or pGL3-Nurr1promoter. For luciferase assays, 0.75 ␮g of
each pGL3 vector and 0.25 ␮g of Renilla plasmid were transfected in each 24-well plate well.
At 2 DIV, cells were treated with NMDA (100 ␮M). 6 h after
treatment, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and were
lysed with 100 ␮l of lysis buffer (Promega). 30 ␮l of cell extract
were used for a luciferase reporter assay (Dual-Luciferase威
reporter assay system, Promega). Data are given as mean ⫾ S.E.
of values obtained in three independent experiments performed in duplicate.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—CGCs were plated in K5
and treated with NMDA (100 ␮M) or K25 at 2 DIV. After 90 min
or 3 h, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with formaldehyde.
Cells were then lysed and sonicated. 2.5 ␮g of soluble chromatin were co-immunoprecipitated with 0.5 ␮l of phosphoJOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY

analysis to identify up- and down-regulated genes using a multiple test-adjusted p value ⬍0.2. For genes with multiple probes,
we selected the most informative probe showing the lowest p
value. The up-regulated genes at 8 h with an increase over
2-fold and a p value ⬍0.05 were submitted to functional annotation analysis with the DAVID program (david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov). Filters used in the functional annotation cluster were:
Similarity Term overlap 6; Similarity threshold 0.70, and Classification initial group membership 5. Hierarchical clustering of
the Affymetrix data was performed with the Cluster software
(version 3.0) and represented with TreeView software. The
clustering algorithm (unweighted pair group method with
arithmetic mean) was used in a centroid linkage fashion on the
probes showing an at least 1-fold change, after being centered
to the median.
Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR)—Total RNA was extracted from CGCs at the indicated
times after treatment with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. 1 ␮g of total RNA was converted
to first strand cDNA using the SuperScriptTM II reverse transcriptase protocol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The resulting cDNA was subjected to PCR analysis. PCR cycling parameters were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min for
one cycle followed by 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for
30 s for 35 cycles and 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR products were
stained with SYBR SafeTM (Invitrogen). A sample without RNA
was always negative; neonatal rat brain RNA was used as a positive control for the products (results not shown). The actual
sequences of specific primers are as follows: Nr4a1/Nur77

a LightCycler 480 II System using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green

11354 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY

changes in gene expression induced by NMDA in CGC cultures, we extracted RNA from K5 cultures treated or not
with the glutamatergic agonist for 3 or 8 h at 2 DIV, and a
gene expression analysis was performed with the Affymetrix
platform rat genome 430 2.0 array. Expression data were
obtained using GCOS software and normalized with robust
multichip average. Statistical analysis was done with the
LIMMA package to identify up- and down-regulated genes
versus control conditions (K5). We considered that a gene
was up-regulated or down-regulated if its expression was
1.5⫻ larger or smaller than in control condition (false discovery rate ⬍0.2).
After exposure to NMDA, we detected 44 up-regulated genes
and 7 down-regulated genes at 3 h (Fig. 1A and supplemental
Table I). 188 up-regulated genes and 112 down-regulated were
detected at 8 h (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table II). Moreover,
we observed that almost 50% of the genes up-regulated at 3 h
were still up-regulated at 8 h and that six of the seven downregulated genes at 3 h had also a reduced expression at 8 h
(supplemental Tables I and II).
To determine the meaning of the expression changes, we
performed a functional annotation analysis of the data
obtained at 3 and 8 h using the DAVID program (data not
shown, Fig. 1B and supplemental Table III). At 3 h, the most
enriched functions and categories were related to transcriptional activity and nuclear localization. By contrast, at 8 h,
the expression changes reflected a more complex situation,
having an enrichment of functions such as neurogenesis,

metabolism and antiapoptotic program (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table III). All of them were in agreement with the
category of signal transduction and cell communication that
got the higher enrichment scores (Fig. 1B and supplemental
Table III).
A deeper analysis of the changes in gene expression indicated
that 4.8% of the up-regulated genes demonstrated at least an
increase of 5-fold in their expression, 8.5% had an increase
between 3- and 5-fold, and 86.7% were increased over 1-fold but
under 3-fold. In the case of down-regulated genes, all of them
were between 1- and 3-fold change (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table II). In the group of genes that changed their expression over 5-fold, we found protein convertase subtilisin/
kexin type 1 (Pcsk1), Vgf, FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral
oncogene homolog (Fos), Bdnf, protein kinase AMP-activated ␥2 noncatalytic subunit, phosphodiesterase 10A, and
the components of the Nr4a family: Nr4a1/Nur77, Nr4a2/
Nurr1, and Nr4a3/NOR-1 (supplemental Table II). In the
group of genes up-regulated over 3-fold but under 5-fold, we
found, for example, synaptotagmin V, stanniocalcin 1,
cAMP-response element modulator (Crem), myocyte
enhancer factor 2, polypeptide C (Mef2C), ␥-aminobutyric

(Kcna4), and metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (see supplemental Table II for further details).
Zhang et al. (30) performed an exhaustive study of the
gene expression changes in response to NMDAR stimulation
comparing the profile between the protective and the excitotoxic stimulation in hippocampal neurons. We compared
their results with our list of genes up-regulated at 3 h, and we
obtained a list of candidates to participate in the NMDA
prosurvival effect in our experimental model (Table l). From
this list, we chose the Nr4a subfamily members because of
their higher increase in expression, their potential role in
apoptosis, and their unknown function in NMDA-mediated
neuronal survival during cerebellum development.
Nurr1 Is Involved in NMDA-mediated Neuronal Survival—
The observed increase in gene expression of the Nr4a subfamily members was further confirmed by RT-PCR. An
increase in Nr4a1, Nr4a2, and Nr4a3 was detected from 1 to
24 h after treatment with NMDA or K25 (Fig. 2A). However,
when the protein levels of the different members of Nr4a
family were determined, only Nr4a2/Nurr1 protein levels
showed a clear and consistent increase in response to NMDA
or K25. Nr4a1/Nur77 and Nr4a3/NOR-1 protein levels were
not increased. In fact, a clear decrease in Nr4a1 and Nr4a3

was observed between 8 and 24 h after NMDA or K25 treatment (Fig. 2B).
To further confirm the observed induction of Nurr1 after
NMDA treatment, we decided to analyze the activation of its
promoter in response to NMDA or K25 treatment. After 6 h
of being treated, CGCs were subjected to a luciferase assay
with a plasmid containing the Nurr1 promoter (pGL3Nurr1promoter). Granule neurons presented an increase of
Nurr1 promoter activity in the presence of NMDA and K25
versus K5 (Fig. 2C).
Next, we analyzed the participation of Nurr1 in the effect of
NMDA on neuronal survival by silencing its expression by
shRNA. CGCs were plated in the presence of lentivirus vectors
containing the shRNA against Nurr1 (Nurr1_1) sequence or
shRNA containing a scrambled Nurr1 sequence (scNurr1) as a
control. As shown in Fig. 3A, the presence of Nurr1_1 shRNA
reduces NMDA-mediated increase in Nurr1 protein levels.
Moreover, the prosurvival effect of NMDA was reduced in the
presence of Nurr1_1 shRNA when either cell viability or the
number of apoptotic nuclei was determined (Fig. 3, B and C). By
contrast, the presence of the Nurr1_1 shRNA did not block the
prosurvival effect of K25 (Fig. 3C).
CREB Regulates NMDA-mediated Induction of Nurr1—It is
widely supported that CREB is an important transcription factor in neuronal survival signaling. Moreover, it is also known
that NMDA activates CREB and that its activation is necessary
for NMDA-mediated neuronal survival (28, 29). Our results
confirmed that in our experimental system, NMDA activates
CREB. As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment of CGC cultures with
NMDA produced a time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation levels of phospho-Ser133-CREB. The increase was evident 1 h after NMDA treatment and reached its higher significance at 8 h (Fig. 4A). We analyzed whether this activation was
accompanied with a higher activity of CREB on Nurr1 promoter by performing a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.
K5 cultures were treated at 2 DIV with NMDA or K25, and 90
min after, cells were fixed to promote the cross-linking of DNA
and proteins. A co-immunoprecipitation of the soluble chromatin was performed with phospho-Ser133-CREB antibody.
The products of de-cross-linking were subjected to Q-RT-PCR
with the primers flanking the Nurr1 promoter that contains the
Cre binding site. We observed a clear increase in CREB binding
to the Nurr1 promoter in the presence of NMDA. An increase
in the binding was observed neither in K5 nor in K25 cultures
(Fig. 4B). Moreover, we assessed the promoter activity in the
presence of two CREB shRNA (creb_1 and creb_2). As shown in
Fig. 4C, both shRNA were able to reduce CREB levels, with the
creb_1 shRNA having a greater effect. Accordingly, both
shRNA inhibited NMDA-mediated activation of Nurr1 promoter, with the creb_1 shRNA having a greater effect reducing
the NMDA-mediated increase in Nurr1 protein levels than the

DISCUSSION
NMDAR stimulation is necessary for neuronal survival
and development in different cerebral areas. One example of
such NMDAR dependence is CGCs. Survival of these neurons during their postnatal migration from the external
granule layer toward the internal granule layer (5, 6) requires
excitatory inputs from the mossy fibers acting through the
NMDARs of CGCs. Failure to receive mossy fibers inputs
triggers apoptotic CGC death (10, 11, 36). In culture, CGCs
are also sensitive to NMDAR stimulation for their survival.
When CGCs are cultured in nondepolarized culture medium
containing K5, the CGCs die by apoptosis (12). However, if
NMDA is added to the medium, the CGCs will survive for
several days (13).
Some studies have shown that the prosurvival effect of
NMDA is mediated by synaptic NMDAR (30, 37). It is
believed that calcium entry through synaptic NMDAR triggers CREB activation (38) likely by stimulation of calmodulin
kinases and/or MEK/ERK kinase pathways (14, 39). In CGCs,
VOLUME 287 • NUMBER 14 • MARCH 30, 2012

Downloaded from http://www.jbc.org/ by guest on August 3, 2018

tion has been attributed to CREB activity (34). To check
whether CREB was involved in NMDA- and Nurr1-mediated
increase in Bdnf expression, we decided to perform a ChIP assay
with the Bdnf promoter IV (35), 90 min and 3 h after NMDA or
K25 treatment. We were unable to detect any significant differences at 90 min in K25-treated cells. However, a robust increase
in CREB binding to Bdnf promoter IV was observed in K25treated cells after 3 h. However, we did not find differences
between NMDA and K5 either at 90 min or at 3 h (supplemental
Fig. 1), suggesting that CREB is not the transcription factor
directly involved in NMDA-mediated activation of Bdnf
expression. Next, we assessed the levels of BDNF in the presence of Nurr1_1 shRNA to know whether NMDA-mediated
BDNF induction could be due to Nurr1. As shown in Fig. 5A,
reducing Nurr1 levels produced a reduction in BDNF protein
levels, suggesting that Nurr1 is directly involved in NMDAmediated induction of Bdnf expression in CGC cultures. This
suggestion was confirmed when we assessed Nurr1 binding to
Bdnf promoter IV by ChIP assay. Our results show that Nurr1
binding to Bdnf promoter IV is clearly increased in NMDAtreated cells. No changes in Nurr1 binding were observed in
K25-treated cells (Fig. 5B). Moreover, NMDA-mediated Nurr1
binding to Bdnf promoter seems to be selective because no
binding was observed to other Bdnf promoters such as promoter III (Fig. 5B).
Next, we performed a first approximation of the in vivo situation by determining the protein levels of Nurr1 and BDNF by
Western blot in cerebellum lysates at different days after birth.
We observed that both mature BDNF and Nurr1 protein levels
increased in the cerebellum during the second postnatal week
in a similar way (Fig. 5C). We went deeper in the expression
analysis of Nurr1 by performing an immunohistochemistry
analysis to know which cells were expressing Nurr1 and
whether its expression was homogeneous in all lobes of the
cerebellum. We detected Nurr1 mainly in the internal granule
layer. Moreover, the expression of Nurr1 was more evident in
the nodulus (lobe X) than in the other lobes of the cerebellum
(Fig. 6 and supplemental Fig. 2).

it has been suggested that the prosurvival effect of NMDAR
stimulation also needs CREB activation (19), the release of
the neurotrophin BDNF (13, 40, 41), the activation of the
PI3K/Akt/PKB pathway (18, 42), and the inactivation of
FOXO transcriptional activity (43). By contrast, the involvement of the MEK/ERK pathway is highly controversial (13,
28, 40).
Because the intracellular signaling triggered by synaptic
NMDAR to promote neuronal survival is still only partially
known, we have used DNA microarrays to have a complete
picture of the NMDA-mediated differences in the transcriptome. This methodology has allowed us not only to identify
single genes that could mediate the prosurvival effect of
NMDAR stimulation, but also to identify which functional
genetic modules are activated. Our ontological analysis
revealed that functional clusters related to neuronal development as well as neurogenesis and antiapoptotic programs were
enriched in NMDA-treated cells. Accordingly, we detected upregulation of the ␣1, ␥2, and ␦ subunits of the GABAA receptor
and a reduction of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, postuMARCH 30, 2012 • VOLUME 287 • NUMBER 14

lated to be responsible for the maturation blockade of CGCs
(44).6 Several genes, related to the development and/or survival
of CGCs, were also up-regulated in NMDA-treated cells, such
as Bdnf, neurocalcin, Vgf, and Pcsk1/3 (31, 45– 49). We decided
to cross-check the list of genes that were up-regulated in
NMDA-treated CGCs at 3 h with the list of up-regulated genes
obtained by Zhang et al. (30) after an action potential-bursting
condition. From all the genes up-regulated in both conditions
(listed in Table 1), we focused our interest on the members of
the Nr4a subfamily because their role in cerebellum development and NMDA-mediated neuroprotection was barely
unknown. Only a previous study had suggested that Nur77 protects hippocampal neurons in culture from staurosporine and
growth factor removal-induced toxicity in vitro and protects
hippocampal neurons from kainate-induced toxicity in vivo
(30). RT-PCR analysis confirmed the increase in the expression
of all the Nr4a subfamily members. However, only Nurr1 pro-

revealed that Nurr1 restricted expression in the nodulus

tein levels were consistently increased after NMDA treatment.
By contrast, Nur77 was down-regulated by NMDA in CGCs,
precluding its effect as a prosurvival factor in these cells.
Although Nurr1 is involved in the development and differentiation of the midbrain dopaminergic neurons (50) and regulates genes such as tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter (51), the fact is that some studies have also shown that it
controls the transcription of proteins such as the VIP (52); ␣-synuclein, (53)); or BDNF (54), which have been related to CGC
survival (31–33, 45). These evidences suggested to us that
Nurr1 could be a putative candidate to mediate NMDA prosurvival action. Accordingly, Nurr1 shRNA reduced NMDA protective effect, showing that endogenous Nurr1 is involved in the
prosurvival signaling triggered by NMDAR. By contrast, no
reduction was observed in the prosurvival effect of K25. As
mentioned above, Nurr1 expression is regulated by CREB in
non-neuronal and in neuronal cells (27, 55, 56). Our data show
for the first time that CREB binds to Nurr1 promoter in
response to NMDA treatment. In addition, reducing CREB levels by shRNA leads to a reduction in the Nurr1 promoter activity as well as a decrease of Nurr1 protein levels in NMDAtreated neurons.
Next, we became interested in identifying the substrate/
substrates of Nurr1 that could be responsible for the prosurvival effect of NMDA. As mentioned above, Nurr1 has been
described to regulate the expression of Bdnf in midbrain
neurons (54), and it is known that BDNF is important in
migration and maintenance of CGCs during cerebellum
development (45, 57, 58). Moreover, BDNF has been suggested to mediate NMDA prosurvival effect on CGCs (13, 40,
41). All these studies allowed us to hypothesize that Nurr1
could be responsible for NMDA-mediated regulation of
Bdnf. Our data support that possibility because: (a) silencing
Nurr1 expression by shRNA produced a decrease in BDNF
levels in NMDA-treated neurons and (b) NMDA increases
the binding of Nurr1 to Bdnf promoter IV. This binding
seems to be specific to certain Bdnf promoters because no
binding of Nurr1 to Bdnf promoter III was observed. It has
been also reported that CREB could interact with the Bdnf
promoter in cortical neurons after KCl stimulation (34). Our
results indicate that in CGCs, the interaction of CREB with
the Bdnf promoter IV is enhanced by KCl stimulation (K25),
whereas it is not enhanced by NMDA treatment (supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, we can conclude that in CGCs, NMDAR
stimulation triggers CREB-dependent Nurr1 activation that
results in a BDNF up-regulation. In this context, we have
observed in vivo that Nurr1 and mature BDNF levels
increase from P9 to P21, suggesting Nurr1 as a mediator of
survival of CGCs during cerebellum development. Additionally, our immunohistochemistry analyses of Nurr1 localization during cerebellum development report for the first time
a lobe-specific expression of Nurr1.
In summary, we have identified by whole genome expression profiling which neuronal genes change their expression
level when survival of CGCs is triggered by NMDAR stimulation. We have characterized Nurr1 as a key mediator factor
in NMDA-dependent survival of CGCs. Nurr1 is a downstream target of CREB activation and is responsible of the
