miR-124-9-9* Potentiates Ascl1-Induced
€ller Glia
Reprogramming of Cultured Mu
Stefanie Gabriele Wohl and Thomas Andrew Reh
The M€
uller glia of fish provide a source for neuronal regeneration after injury, but they do not do so in mammals. We previously showed that lentiviral gene transfer of the transcription factor Achaete-scute homolog 1 (Ascl1/Mash1) in murine M€
uller
glia cultures resulted in partial reprogramming of the cells to retinal progenitors. The microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-124-9-9* facilitate neuronal reprogramming of fibroblasts, but their role in glia reprogramming has not been reported. The aim of this
study was to test whether (1) lentiviral gene transfer of miR-124-9-9* can reprogram M€
uller glia into retinal neurons and (2)
miR-124-9-9* can improve Ascl1-induced reprogramming. Primary M€
uller glia cultures were generated from postnatal day (P)
11/12 mice, transduced with lentiviral particles, i.e., miR-124-9-9*-RFP, nonsense-RFP, Ascl1-GFP, or GFP-control. Gene
expression and immunofluorescence analyses were performed within 3 weeks after infection.
1. Overexpression of miR-124-9-9* induced the expression of the proneural factor Ascl1 and additional markers of neurons,
including TUJ1 and MAP2.
2. When Ascl1 and miR-124-9-9* were combined, 50 to 60% of M€
uller glia underwent neuronal reprogramming, whereas
Ascl1 alone results in a 30 to 35% reprogramming rate.
3. Analysis of the miR-124-9-9* treated glial cells showed a reduction in the level of Ctdsp1 and Ptbp1, indicating a critical
role for the REST pathway in the repression of neuronal genes in M€
uller glia.
Our data further suggest that miR-124-9-9* and the REST complex may play a role in regulating the reprogramming of M€
uller
glia to progenitors that underlies retinal regeneration in zebrafish.

Introduction

T

he adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) largely
lacks regenerative capacity. However, recent reports show that
glial cells can be reprogrammed and can potentially serve as a
source for new neurons to replace those lost by injury or disease
(Goldman, 2014; Guo et al., 2014; Heinrich et al., 2012, 2014;
Niu et al., 2013; Robel et al., 2011). This approach has advantages, since the cells are produced in situ and transplantation is
not required. A variety of factors have been used to successfully
reprogram fibroblasts, P19 carcinoma cells, and glia into neurons.
Several groups have shown that overexpression of key proneural
transcription factors such as Sox2, NeuroD1, and Ascl1 causes a
significant percentage of astrocytes (Corti et al., 2012; Guo et al.,
2014; Heinrich et al., 2012; Niu et al., 2013) or NG2 glia
(Heinrich et al., 2014) to differentiate into neurons.

In the retina, M€
uller glia are the predominant glia (for
review see (Bringmann et al., 2006; Reichenbach and Bringmann, 2013)) and express some genes that are also expressed
by neural progenitor cells (NPCs) (Bernardos et al., 2007;
Das et al., 2006; Jadhav et al., 2009; Ooto et al., 2004;
Roesch et al., 2008). In non-mammalian vertebrates such as
fish, retinal injury induces M€
uller glia to re-enter the cell
cycle, de-differentiate and generate new neurons. (Goldman
2014; Lenkowski and Raymond, 2014; Ramachandran et al.,
2010). In mammals however, this potential is very limited
(L€offler et al., 2015); the ability to proliferate decreases with
age (Close et al., 2006; Ueki and Reh, 2013) and very few
neurons are generated after injury in adult mammalian retina,
even after multiple injections of mitogens (Karl et al., 2008)

and Reh, 2010; Wohl et al., 2012). We recently reported that
lentiviral-mediated expression of Ascl1 was sufficient to reprogram 30% of dissociated M€
uller glia to a neurogenic state.
However, many of the cells failed to generate neurons, even
though they expressed Ascl1 (Pollak et al., 2013). Thus, additional factors are likely necessary for full reprogramming of
M€
uller glia and complete retinal regeneration in mice.
Many studies have highlighted the importance of
miRNAs in the regulation of cell fate and stable patterns of
gene expression (for review see (Filipowicz et al., 2008; Sundermeier and Palczewski, 2012)). One miRNA that plays an
important role during neurogenesis is miR-124, a brain
enriched miRNA, expressed in differentiating and mature
neurons, but not in non-neuronal cells, including glia (Cheng
et al., 2009; Conaco et al., 2006; Krichevsky et al., 2006;
Makeyev et al., 2007; Papagiannakopoulos and Kosik, 2009;
Smirnova et al., 2005). miR-124 (also known as miR-124a)
is encoded by three genes (miR-124a-1, miR-124a-2,
miR-124a-3) (Conaco et al., 2006; Deo et al., 2006) and the
mature sequence is highly conserved from C. elegans to
humans (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002). Another brain enriched
miRNA involved in neurogenesis is miR-9. miR-9 is also
encoded by three genes (miR-9-1, miR-9-2, miR-9-3), but in
contrast to miR-124, where only one mature miRNA exists,
each of the miR-9 genes gives rise to two mature miRNAs,
miR-9 (which is the 5’ strand, miR-9-5p) and miR-9* (which
is the 3’ strand, miR-9-3p) (Conaco et al., 2006).
Gain of function experiments with miR-124 alone or in
combination with miR-9/9* in embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
(Krichevsky et al., 2006; Maiorano and Mallamaci, 2009)
and NPCs (Cheng et al., 2009; Maiorano and Mallamaci,
2009), show that miR-124 promotes neuronal differentiation,
while inhibiting glial genes. Moreover, miR-124-9-9*, has
been shown to reprogram fibroblasts (Yoo et al., 2011), and
miR-124 alone can increase retinoic acid-induced neurogenesis in P19 stem cells (Makeyev et al., 2007). miR-124 and
miR-9/9* target components of the REST complex, known
to repress neuronal gene expression in non-neuronal cells
(Nesti et al., 2014; Wu and Xie, 2006; Yeo et al., 2005). The
REST complex is composed of the RE1-silencing transcription factor, REST, also known as neuron-restrictive silencer
factor NRSF (Chong et al., 1995; Schoenherr and Anderson,
1995); the REST corepressor 1, also known as CoREST,
encoded by Rcor1 (Andres et al., 1999); and the carboxyterminal domain RNA polymerase II polypeptide A small
phosphatase 1 (Ctdsp1), also known as small c-terminal
domain phosphatase 1, SCP1 (Nesti et al., 2014; Visvanathan
et al., 2007; Yeo et al., 2005). In light of these previous studies, we tested whether the REST pathway was active in
M€
uller glia, repressing neuronal gene expression and stabilizing their phenotype. Specifically, we tested whether miR-124744

9-9* overexpression would reprogram M€
uller glia into neuronal progenitors and neurons, either alone or in combination
with Ascl1, and if the reprogramming mechanism involves
RNA downregulation of members of the REST complex.
Here we report that miRNAs miR-124, miR-9, and
miR-9* can promote M€
uller glia reprogramming. Lentiviral
gene transfer of miR-124-9-9*-induced cells to express genes
normally present in retinal progenitor cells and neurons. Furthermore, the combination of Ascl1 and miR-124-9-9*
yielded in 60% newly generated neurons from M€
uller glia
primary cultures. Two of the known targets in the REST
pathway, Ctdsp1/SCP1 and the polypyrimidine tract binding
protein 1 (Ptbp1/PTB), were reduced in the miR-124-9-9*
infected glia, while the neuronal Ptbp2 was increased. These
results support a role for the REST pathway in neuronal gene
silencing in M€
uller glia cells, and show that targeting this
pathway with miRNAs is an effective method to promote
reprogramming of these cells.

Materials and Methods
Animals
All mice were used in accordance with University of Washington
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved protocols
(UW-IACUC). All experiments were carried out on C57BL/6J mice
(Jackson). Experiments to test Ascl1 induction were performed on
mAscl1-creER:flox-Stop-flox tdTomato (gift from Dr. Jane Johnson).

Plasmids and Viral Production
pLemir-9-124, encoding for miR-9/9* and miR-124 pri-transcripts
together with turbo-RFP reporter [(Yoo et al., 2011), plasmid
#31779], and the control turbo-RFP plasmid pLemir-NS encoding
for non-specific hairpins (here referred as nonsense/ns, plasmid
#32809) were purchased from Addgene and inserted into lentiviral
vectors using the Lenti-XTM HTX packaging system protocol (Clontech). PLOC-hASCL1-IRES-turboGFP(nuc) and control PLOCIRES-turboGFP(nuc) viral vectors were generated as described previously (Pollak et al., 2013). Dominant-negative (dn)Ctdsp1, wildtype
(wt)Ctdsp1 plasmids were obtained from Dr. Soo-Kyung Lee,
dnREST and wtREST plasmid from Dr. Gail Mandel, and used for
DNA transfection.

M€
uller Glia Primary Culture
M€
uller glia were dissociated from postnatal day (P) 11/12 mice and
grown in Neurobasal medium with N2 (supplemental factor),
tetracycline-free 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Clontech), and epidermal growth factor (EGF, R&D Systems, 100 ng/mL) as described
before (Ueki et al., 2012). The in vitro experiments are limited to
the age of P12. Although M€
uller glia from mice older than P12 can
be cultured, they do not grow and do not form confluent monolayers, which are required for successful reprogramming experiments.
The thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2’deoxyuridine (EdU, Invitrogen, 1
lM) was added to follow progeny of proliferating M€
uller glia. To
activate Cre recombinase in the Ascl1-creER:flox-Stop-flox tdTomato

M€uller glia cultures, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma, 1 nM) was added
to the medium after passage.

Transfection
For RNA transfection, we used mimics (artificial miRNAs, 20 nM–
1 mM) and antagomiRs (antisense miRNAs, 20 nM) purchased from
Thermo Scientific in combination with mCherry RNA and/or
miRNA-GFP sensors (1 mg/mL each). To generate mRNA for transfection, we used the pSLU plasmid as described previously (Hayashi
et al., 2010) and the Ambion mMessage mMachine (AM1345;
Ambion) according to manufacturer’s instructions. We also used
dnCtdsp1, wtCtdsp1, dnREST, wtREST and mCherry or ns-RFP
control plasmids (500 ng/well of a 24-well plate) for DNA transfection. M€uller glia from either C57/BL6J or mAscl-creER:flox-Stopflox tdTomato mice were transfected using Dharmafect transfection
reagent in Optimem medium, in accordance with manufacturer’s
instructions, one day post passage. After transfection, the media was
changed to neuronal media (1% FBS with B27 supplemental factor).
For reference and to test functionality, both, miR-GFP sensors
and miR-124-9-9*-RFP lentiviral vectors have been tested on human
embryonic kidney cell line HEK293. Cultures were analyzed 6 h to
6 days post-transfection/transduction.

Immunofluorescent Labelings
M€
uller glia were cultured on Poly-D-lysine (PDL) and Matrigel (Corning) covered coverslips in 24-well plates. Cells were fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde (PFA). EdU labeling was carried out using Click-iT
EdU Kit (Invitrogen). For immunofluorescent staining, cells were
incubated in blocking solution (5% milk block: 2.5 g nonfat milk
powder in 50 mL PBS; with 0.5% Triton-X100) for 1 h at RT. Primary antibodies (Table 3) were incubated in 5% milk block overnight, secondary antibodies (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, and Jackson
ImmunoResearch, 1:500–1,000) for 1 h at RT and counterstained
with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma, 1:1,000).

Microscopy, Cell Counts, and Statistical Analysis
Live imaging was performed using Zeiss Observer D1 with AxioCam. Fixed cells were analyzed by Olympus FV1000 confocal
microscope. Five to 10 random fields per coverslip, one to two coverslips per condition, at 2003 magnification were counted for every
condition, of at least five independent experiments. Values are
expressed as mean 6 SEM. Statistical analysis were performed by
Student’s t-test for independent samples combined with Levene’s test
for equality of variances. Holm-Bonferroni method was used to correct for multiple comparisons.

Lentiviral Gene Transfer

Results

Lentiviral particles were added in neuronal medium (see above)
together with brain derived neurotrophic factor (hBDNF, R&D Systems 10 ng/ml), fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, R&D Systems, 100
ng/mL), glia derived neurotrophic factor (rGDNF, R&D Systems,
10 ng/mL), and the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Thiazovinin (Sigma Aldrich, 10 nM) (Watanabe et al., 2007). M€
uller glia
were transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing miR-124-9-9*-RFP
and ns-RFP at 5-7DIV, and analyzed 2, 5, 8, and 12 days posttransduction. In other experiments, M€
uller glia were first transduced
with lentiviral vectors expressing Ascl1-GFP or control GFP at 57DIV, then with either miR-124-9-9*-RFP or ns-RFP lentiviral vectors at 9-10DIV, and analyzed at 15-21DIV.

miR-124 is Absent in Most M€
uller Glia
Previous studies have shown that miR-124 is not highly
expressed in glia (Cheng et al., 2009; Smirnova et al., 2005),
including adult M€
uller glia (Sanuki et al., 2011). In order to
analyze the expression levels of miR-124 together with other
miRNAs in P11/12 M€
uller glia cultures, we used either RTqPCR or miR-GFP sensors (Fig. 1A). By RT-qPCR we found
low levels of miR-124 and miR-9* (Fig. 1B) in dissociated cultures of M€
uller glial cells (naive). By contrast, miR-9 displayed
high levels, similar to those of miR-24 and several let-7 family
members known to be present in glia (La Torre et al., 2013;
Patterson et al., 2014; Shenoy et al., 2015; Smirnova et al.,
2005). Next, we compared the expression levels of miRNAs
from dissociated naive M€
uller glia with those from newborn
(P0) mouse retinas, which contain a mix of immature neurons
and progenitor cells. Normalization to P0 retinas showed that
M€
uller glia have much less miR-124, less miR-9, let-7a, and let7f, but show comparable levels of miR-24 and let-7b (Fig. 1C).
To confirm the findings of the RT-qPCR analysis, we
used miRNA-sensors. miR-GFP sensors contain mRNA for
GFP with a specific 3’ UTR that have consensus binding sites
for a particular miRNA. Therefore, if the particular miRNA
is absent, GFP mRNA is stable and translated (Fig. 1D). In
the presence of the miRNA, the sensor mRNA will be
degraded or its translation will be blocked (Fig. 1D’). First,
M€
uller glia cells were transfected with miR-124-GFP sensor
and mCherry transfection control. mCherry RNA transfection
resulted in expression in almost every M€
uller glia after 2 to 3

Reverse Transcriptase Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
for mRNA and miRNA
Cells were lysed in Qiazol and RNA was extracted and purified with
a miRNeasy Mini Kit in accordance to manufacturer’s instructions
(Qiagen). For conventional mRNA analysis, cDNA was synthetized
using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad; primers are listed in
Table 1). For miRNAs, stem-loop RT primers were used to produce
cDNA for specific miRNAs (Fiedler et al., 2010). RT-qPCR was
performed using SsoFast Eva Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) on a BioRad Thermocycler. Primers used are shown in Table 2. At least six
biological replicates (n) were used; every n consisted of 6 to 10 mice
of one litter. Reactions were run in triplicates or duplicates for RT or
–RT samples. Values were normalized to beta actin and/or 5sRNA.
Delta DCt between treatment (miR-124-9-9*, Ascl1-GFP, and Ascl1GFP/miR-124-9-9*) and corresponding controls (ns-RFP or GFP)
were calculated and are expressed together with standard error of the
mean (SEM).

days (Fig. 1E). Approximately 65% of all transfected
mCherry1 cells were also GFP1; meaning they did not
express sufficient levels of miR-124 to prevent the sensor
expression (Fig. 1F-F’,H). To validate miR-124-GFP sensor
functionality, miR-124 mimics were added to the glial cultures along with the sensors. The miR-124 mimics caused a
large reduction in the number of cells expressing the sensor
(Fig. 1G-G’,H). We also tested miR-124-GFP sensors on
HEK293 cells, known to lack most miRNAs, to verify their
functionality (Supp. Info. Fig. S1A-A’’).
Next, we used a sensor for miR-9 to confirm the RTqPCR data. We first tested miR-9-GFP sensors for functionality in HEK293 cells (Supp. Info. Fig. S1B-B’’). When the
sensor was transfected into cultured glia, we found very few
green cells (less than 10%), indicating that 90% of M€
uller
746

glia in vitro have sufficient levels of miR-9 to prevent sensor
expression (Supp. Info. Fig. S2A’-A’’,C). We confirmed that
the sensor was reporting correctly by co-transfection of miR-9
antagomiR, which resulted in an increase in sensor expression
(Supp. Info. Fig. S2B’-B’’,C).
Taken together, the RT-qPCR and transfection data
show that miR-124 and miR-9* are expressed at low levels in
the majority of dissociated P11/12 M€
uller glia; however,
miR-9 is expressed by glia but in lower levels than in progenitors/immature neurons.

has been previously described to reprogram fibroblasts to neurons (Yoo et al., 2011). To ensure functionality, we transfected miR-124-9-9*-transduced HEK293 cells with miR124-GFP sensor. None of the miR-124-9-9*- transduced cells
were positive for GFP implying that miR-124 was overexpressed successfully (Supp. Info. Fig. S1C-C’’). As a control,
we used nonsense (ns)-RFP lentiviral vectors, which encodes
for a non-specific hairpin. Dissociated M€
uller glial cells were
transduced after 6-9DIV, when they reached confluence (Fig.
2A). RT-qPCR for miRNAs revealed that miR-124-9-9* lentiviral particle-transduction resulted in increased levels of
miR-124, miR-9, and miR-9*, while other miRNAs remained
unaffected (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, miR-124 displayed a fourcycle increase as compared with naive controls. miR-9 and
miR-9* were increased by about two cycles after transduction.
We cannot explain why miR-9 and miR-9* levels are not
increasing in a similar manner as miR-124 does. However, in
case of miR-9, it is probably due to the fact that naive glia
express this miRNA at higher levels. Next, we analyzed
mRNA levels of genes expressed highly in retinal progenitors,
but normally not in M€
uller glia. RT-qPCR data showed that
there was a significant upregulation for the retinal progenitor
genes Ascl1 and Hes5 (Fig. 2C). Otx2 and Islet1, two genes
expressed in retinal neurons early in their differentiation
(Boije et al., 2014) also increased. Interestingly, these two
genes were also upregulated after Ascl1 transduction (Pollak
et al., 2013). Besides progenitor genes, we found increased
RNA levels of neuronal genes such as Neurofilament-M (NFM), doublecortin (Dcx), MAP2, and TUJ1 but not Brn3a
(Fig. 2D). These results are consistent with the hypothesis
that miR-124-9-9* can promote retinal progenitor gene
expression and reprogram the cells to a neurogenic state, possibly by reducing expression of some target gene(s). We also
748

analyzed the expression levels of glial genes. We found that
genes such as retinaldehyde binding protein 1 (Rlbp1, which
encodes for the cellular retinaldehyde binding protein
Cralbp), glutamine synthetase (Glul, also known as
glutamate-ammonia ligase, GS), S100b calcium binding protein b, solute carrier family 1 member 3 (glial high affinity
glutamate transporter, Slc1a3, also known as GLAST, Eaat1),
and Aquaporin4 (Aqp4) were significantly downregulated as
compared with controls, consistent with the loss of glial identity (Fig. 2E).
To further confirm Ascl1 induction after miR-124-9-9*
overexpression we used cultured M€
uller glia from AsclcreER:flox-Stop-flox tdTomato mice, in media containing 4hydroxytamoxifen to allow reporter expression. We transfected
them with the miR-124, miR-9, and miR-9* mimics
(500 nM each, Fig. 3A). We found an increase in tdTomato1
cells over time with a sixfold increase 6 days post-transfection
(Fig. 3B,D).
To determine whether miR-124-9-9* transduction
reprograms M€
uller glia to neurons, we labeled the cultures
with EdU and neuronal markers, TUJ1 and MAP2. Five to
12 days after miR-124-9-9* transduction, 15% of all proliferating RFP1 cells were TUJ11 (controls <5%) and had a
neuronal morphology (Fig. 4A-A’’’,B-B’’,E). The increase in
TUJ1 was consistent with the RT-qPCR data (Fig. 2D). We
also used MAP2 as a marker for more mature neurons (Fig.
4C-C’’’,D-D’’). Five days after miR-124-9-9* transduction,
no noticeable MAP2 signals were detected in RFP1EdU1
cells; however, after 8 to 12 days, 11 to 15% of all
RFP1EdU1 cells were MAP21 (Fig. 4E’) reflecting the
MAP2 mRNA increase we observed before (Fig. 2D). The
transduction efficiency for miR-124-9-9*-RFP infection was
60%, and the control nonsense-RFP transduction was

consistent with retinal amacrine and ganglion cell types.

miR-124-9-9* Facilitates M€
uller Glia Reprogramming
by Ascl1
We previously reported that Ascl1-GFP overexpression can
reprogram M€
uller glia to a neurogenic state, activating progenitor genes and inducing the cells to generate neurons.
However, we found that only about 30% of the M€
uller glial
cells were reprogrammed by Ascl1 (Pollak et al., 2013).

found increased levels of miR-124, miR-9, and miR-9* in Ascl1/
miR-124-9-9* co-transduced cells, confirming successful overexpression of the miRNAs in co-transduced cultures (Fig. 6D).
miR-124-9-9* levels in the co-transduced cultures were similar to
levels in miR-124-9-9* single transduced cultures (Fig. 2B).
However, we also observed an upregulation of let-7a and let-7b
after co-transduction, which was not seen after miR-124-9-9*
overexpression (Figs. 2B and 6D). In addition, we observed significantly increased levels of miR-124 after Ascl1 transduction,
consistent with a previous report in P19 cells (Yu et al., 2008).
Next, we tested the expression of key retinal developmental genes, specific to particular cell types. Atoh7, Islet1,
and Onecut2 are expressed early in retinal neurogenesis and
are important for generation of retinal ganglion cells and
other early-generated cell types, whereas Otx2 is necessary for

photoreceptors and bipolar cells (Boije et al., 2014). Ascl1
transduction resulted in a significant upregulation of all of
these genes, in accordance to our previous study (Pollak
et al., 2013). After co-transduction with Ascl1 and miR-1249-9*, all tested progenitor genes were significantly upregulated
and only Atoh7 showed an increase in expression compared
with Ascl1 alone (Fig. 6E). Next, we analyzed mRNA levels
of glial genes. After Ascl1 single transduction, we found a significant downregulation of Rlbp, Glul, Slc1a3, and Aqp4,
consistent with the data of our previous study (Pollak et al.,
2013) and that of other reports about the loss of glial properties after Ascl1 induction (Wurm et al., 2009). After transduction of Ascl1 in combination with miR-124-9-9*, similar
results were found, only Slc1a3, the gene for Glast, was lower
expressed as in Ascl1 transduced cultures (Fig. 6F).

Although RT-qPCR did not show any changes in expression levels of retinal developmental genes, except for Atoh7, we
analyzed the cultures for more general neuronal markers
MAP2 and TUJ1, and quantified the numbers of newly generated (EdU1) neurons. We found that 30% of the total
GFP1EdU1 cells expressed MAP21 in Ascl1-transduced cultures (Fig. 7A-A’, blue arrows, D) similar to our previous
May 2016

results (Pollak et al., 2013). In Ascl1/miR-124-9-9* cotransduced cultures however, the fraction of newly generated
neurons was 63% (Fig. 7B-B’, blue arrows, D), which represents a further increase of the newly generated fraction by 33%
as compared with Ascl1 alone. The fraction of
MAP21GFP1EdU1 cells in control wells was <2% (Fig. 7CC’,D). In all cultures, there were a small numbers of retinal
755

neurons that survived the dissociation and culture period.
These cells are also MAP21 but could be distinguished from
newly generated neurons because of their lack of EdU (Fig.
7A’,B’ yellow arrows). In addition, in Ascl1-transduced cultures, we found a noticeable number of cells with big nuclei
(Fig. 7A’ asterisks), which are the most prevalent cell type in
control cultures (Fig. 7C’ asterisks), indicating incomplete
reprogramming. In Ascl1/miR-124-9-9* co-transduced cultures
however, these cells were rare (Fig. 7B’ asterisks).
Next, we counted numbers of TUJ11GFP1EdU1 cells
for Ascl1 alone and Ascl1/miR-124-9-9* co-transduced cultures and compared them to the GFP-controls. In controls,
there were very few TUJ11 cells (<1%) that were labeled
with EdU; by contrast, in Ascl1-transduced cultures, 37% of
total GFP1EdU1 cells expressed TUJ1 (Fig. 7E), in accordance with our previous study (Pollak et al., 2013). Interestingly, similar neuronal fractions have been also reported
recently after astrocyte reprogramming with Ascl1 (Masserdotti et al., 2015). However, in cultures transduced with both
Ascl1 and miR-124-9-9*, 59% of the total GFP1EdU1 cells
were labeled with TUJ1, an increase of 22% as compared
with Ascl1 alone. For all three conditions, we obtained transduction efficiencies over 90% (Fig. 7F) and cell survival of
between 54% (co-transduced) and 62% (Ascl1 alone) over
the culture period (not shown). Taken together, the results
show that the combination of Ascl1 with miR-124-9-9*
results in larger fractions of glial-derived, newly generated
neurons that are MAP21 and TUJ11.
Ctdsp1 and Ptbp1 of the REST Complex are
Downregulated in miR-124-9-9*-Transduced
M€
uller Glia
The mechanisms through which miR-124-9-9* promotes
reprogramming may be related to those through which it regulates neurogenesis. To determine whether some of the same
targets were involved, we focused on target genes of miR-124
and miR-9/9* that are down-regulated in neurogenesis, but
are also expressed in M€
uller glia. We used Targetscan (http://
www.targetscan.org/) and miRbase (http://www.mirbase.org/)
to screen for these targets (Table 4). We compared expression
levels of target genes in M€
uller glia with a previously generated cDNA microarray analysis of P12 cultured M€
uller glia
(Pollak et al., 2013). We focused on miR-124 targets, since
this miRNA showed the highest increase in RT-qPCR. We
found a significant decrease in Ctdsp1 and Ptbp1 gene levels
in miR-124-9-9*-transduced M€
uller glia as compared with
controls (Fig. 8A, Table 4, blue lines). Both genes are highly
expressed in cultured M€
uller glia and known targets of miR124 (Makeyev et al., 2007; Visvanathan et al., 2007; Yeo
et al., 2005). We also observed an increase of Ptbp2, a gene
negatively regulated by Pbtb1 and known to be upregulated
756

in neuronal cells (Boutz et al., 2007; Makeyev et al., 2007).
Other potential targets, including CoREST (Volvert et al.,
2014; Wu and Xie, 2006), and also REST itself, Ezh2 (Neo
et al., 2014) and a variety of other genes (data not shown, see
Table 4) showed no significant changes in mRNA levels in
the miR-124-9-9* infected cultures. In order to confirm the
repressor characteristics of Ctdsp1 and REST, we transfected
M€
uller glia with dnCtdsp1 and dnREST plasmids (Supp.
Info. Fig. S3A). Ascl-creER: flox-Stop-flox tdTomato M€
uller
glia cell cultures were used to test for Ascl1 induction. We
found increased numbers of tdTomato1 cells after dnCtdsp1,
but not after wtCtdsp1 plasmid transfection (Supp. Info. Fig.
S3B-B’,C-C’, respectively), confirming that inhibition of
Ctdsp1 has the same effect on Ascl1 induction as miR-124-99* overexpression. Moreover, 6 days after transfection with
either dnCtdsp1 or dnREST, we found MAP21EdU1 neurons (Supp. Info. Fig. S3D-D’,E-E’), although plasmid transfections were less efficient than viral transduction (6% vs.
60% respectively), and so, the results are not directly comparable. Nevertheless, using this approach, we find that inhibition of the REST pathway leads to upregulation of Ascl1 and
neuronal reprogramming.

Discussion
miRNAs have been reported to play important roles in glial
development and maintenance (Buller et al., 2012; Georgi
and Reh, 2011; Kuang et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2010) for
review see (Bian et al., 2013) and in gliosis (Mor et al., 2011;
Wang et al., 2015). However, to our knowledge, this is the
first report to show they can be used to reprogram glia to a
neurogenic state. Here we show for the first time that the
miRNAs, more precisely miR-124-9-9*, can promote the
expression of neuronal progenitor genes, like Ascl1 in the
glia, and ultimately reprogram the glial cells into neuronal
cells. In addition, if miR-124-9-9* is combined with Ascl1, it
potentiates M€
uller glia reprogramming, yielding more neurons than with either miR-124-9-9* or Ascl1 alone. We also
found a significant downregulation of Ctdsp1 and Ptbp1
mRNA, both components of the REST complex, suggesting
that this repressive pathway functions in glia to maintain their
phenotype and prevent reprogramming to neurons.
A Role for miRNAs in Reprogramming NonNeuronal Cells to Neurons
Overexpression of key proneural transcription factors such as
NeuroD, Brn2, Myt1l, Sox2, and Ascl1 can cause a significant percentage of fibroblasts, P19 cells, astroglia, or NG2
glia to differentiate into neurons (Caiazzo et al., 2011; Corti
et al., 2012; Heinrich et al., 2012, 2014; Pang et al., 2011;
Pollak et al., 2013; Vierbuchen et al., 2010). In our previous
studies, we found that overexpression of Ascl1 was sufficient

to promote partial reprogramming in mouse M€
uller glia (Pollak et al., 2013). Interestingly, miRNAs have been reported to
reprogram fibroblasts or P19 cells into neurons, and moreover, potentiate transcription factor-induced reprogramming.
The miRNAs miR-124 and miR-9 are highly enriched
in the CNS, and are known to be regulators of neurogenesis
(Cheng et al., 2009; Krichevsky et al., 2006; Lim et al.,
2005; Neo et al., 2014; Smirnova et al., 2005; Yu et al.,
2008). Moreover, miR-124, alone or in combination with
miR-9/9*, has been reported to reprogram fibroblasts (Yoo
et al., 2011) and P19 cells (Visvanathan et al., 2007) into
May 2016

functional neurons and can substitute for proneural transcription factors. However, there are no previous reports that this
approach would also apply to glial cells.
Here we show for the first time that overexpression of
miR-124-9-9* can also reprogram M€
uller glia to produce
neurons, without any additional neurogenic reprogramming
factors. Overexpression of miR-124-9-9* causes an increase in
progenitor genes, including Ascl1, and neuronal genes (e.g.,
Dcx); a significant percentage of the cells expressed neuronal
markers (e.g., MAP2, TUJ1) and showed morphological characteristics of neurons. These results are consistent with

FIGURE 8: miR-124-9-9* targets Ctdsp1 and Ptbp1 and appears to act via the REST/CoREST/Ctdsp1/Ptbp1 pathway. A, RT-qPCR of miR124-9-9*-transduced M€
uller glia showed downregulation of Ctdsp1 and Ptbp1 but upregulation of Ptbp2. Ctdsp1 and Ptbp1 are components of the REST complex which silences neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells. Since these components are downregulated while Ptbp2
is upregulated, M€
uller glia reprogramming appears to utilize the same mechanism as fibroblast reprogramming or neurogenesis. This
mechanism is shown in B. For simplification, only the inhibitory interactions are shown. Inactive/silenced components are displayed in
gray. In non-neuronal or progenitor cells, the REST complex, which has REST, CoREST, and MeCP2 in its core, represses the expression
of neuronal genes (e.g., Ascl1) and targets brain-enriched miRNAs including miR-124, miR-9/9*. The REST complex is stabilized by
Ctdsp1 and is also indirectly supported by Ptbp1. Ptbp1 also represses Ptbp2. In neuronal cells and miR-124-9-9*reprogrammed cells,
the members of the REST core complex are targeted and silenced by miR-124, miR-9/9* which leads to expression of neuronal genes
including Ascl1. These targets are here Ctdsp1 and Ptbp1. Modified after (Abrajano et al., 2009b; Sun et al., 2013; Visvanathan et al.,

previous reports in migrating neuronal progenitors (Volvert
et al., 2014), P19 cells (Visvanathan et al., 2007), and fibroblasts (Yoo et al., 2011) where Dcx, Ngn2 together with NeuroD, and TUJ1 expression increased either because of
increasing endogenous miR-124 expression (during neurogenesis) or vector mediated miR-124 overexpression (reprogramming). Interestingly, miR-124-9-9* overexpression alone can
reprogram a small percentage of fibroblasts to neurons, but is
much more effective when combined with other proneural
transcription factors (Yoo et al., 2011). Moreover, miR-124
alone can also induce modest neuronal reprogramming in
P19 cells (Visvanathan et al., 2007) but noticeable neuronal
758

differentiation in neuroblastoma cells (Makeyev et al., 2007),
without any other factors. These results suggest that cells in
the neural lineage including glia, are more likely to be reprogrammed by miR-124 than cells from different lineages, such
as fibroblasts.
We also found that the combination of Ascl1 and miR124-9-9* resulted in a higher fraction of reprogrammed cells,
when compared with that observed with Ascl1 alone. This
synergistic effect has also been reported in fibroblasts (Ambasudhan et al., 2011; Yoo et al., 2011) as well as in P19 cells
(Yu et al., 2008), but not for any glia cell type yet. The synergy may be in part due to the fact that Ascl1 overexpression

Wohl and Reh: miRNAs in Glial Reprogramming

causes an increase of endogenous miR-124 (Yu et al., 2008),
and the induction of neurogenesis induces miR-124 (Conaco
et al., 2006; Makeyev et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2008), and miR9-9* (Sempere et al., 2004).
miR-124-9-9* Act via the REST Complex by
Repressing Specific Components
One of the major mechanisms by which miR-124 regulates
neuronal gene expression is via its repression of the antineuronal
REST/CoREST/Ctdsp1/Ptbp1/Ptbp2
pathway
(Chong et al., 1995; Conaco et al., 2006; Makeyev et al.,
2007; Nesti et al., 2014; Schoenherr and Anderson, 1995;
Visvanathan et al., 2007; Wu and Xie, 2006; Xue et al.,
2013; Yeo et al., 2005), summarized in Fig. 8B. The REST
complex consists of REST itself, CoREST, and the methyl
CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and is stabilized by Ctdsp1.
In non-neuronal cells, REST targets neuronal genes as well as
miR-124, miR-9, and miR-9* and represses their expression.
In neurons and in their precursors, miR-124, miR-9, and
miR-9* target members of the REST complex, which allows
expression of neuronal genes.
Our results show that Ctdsp1 is reduced by expression
of miR-124-9-9* in M€
uller glia, consistent with previous
reports in other cell types (Visvanathan et al., 2007). Ctdsp1
is recruited by REST and is required for REST function
(Nesti et al., 2014; Yeo et al., 2005). Since REST targets a
variety of neuronal genes including Dcx (Mandel et al.,
2011) and Ascl1 (Wu and Xie, 2006), this mechanism may
explain why we see increases in these genes after miR-124-99* overexpression in M€
uller glia. We also found a decrease of
Ptbp1, and an increase of Ptbp2 mRNA after miR-124-9-9*
overexpression in M€
uller glia. In the brain, Ptbp2 (neuronal
PTB/nPTB) protein has been reported to be specifically
expressed in post-mitotic neurons, whereas Ptbp1 is restricted
to NPCs, glia, and other non-neuronal cells (Boutz et al.,
2007). Ptbp1 represses the alternative splicing of neuronal
genes in non-neuronal tissue (Makeyev et al., 2007). This
repression is due in part to Ptbp1-induced alternative splicing
of Ptbp2 mRNA, leading to nonsense-mediated decay (Boutz
et al., 2007). During neuronal differentiation, the increasing
levels of miR-124 cause a reduction in Pbtp1, which leads to
the accumulation of correctly spliced Ptbp2 protein (Makeyev
et al., 2007). In addition, Ptbp1 blocks miR-124-mediated
silencing of the REST complex, while miR-124 targets
Ctdsp1 and leads to destabilization of the REST complex.
Ptbp1 has been reported to compete with miR-124 on the 3’
UTR of Ctdsp1 and therefore stabilize the REST complex. If
Ptbp1 is antagonized, Ptbp1-mediated inhibition of miR-124
is abolished, and this leads to expression of a large number of
neuronal genes, including miR-124, miR-9, and miR-9* (Xue
et al., 2013). The studies using miR-124-9-9* in reprogramMay 2016

ming of mature cells have so far used cells from non-neural
tissues, where Ptbp1, Ctdsp1, and/or REST function represses
neuronal gene expression (Ambasudhan et al., 2011; Makeyev
et al., 2007; Visvanathan et al., 2007; Yoo et al., 2011; Yu
et al., 2008). Our results now indicate that this pathway also
plays a role in M€
uller glia conversion into neurons, since
dnCtdsp1 and dnREST plasmids cause an upregulation of
Ascl1 (tdTomato1 cells) and Map21EdU1 neurons 6 days
post-transfection. Since in our study miR-124-9-9* overexpression decreases Ctdsp1 and Ptbp1 mRNA and increases
Ptbp2, Ascl1 and other neuronal genes in M€
uller glia, and
moreover, inhibition of REST or Ctdsp1 resulted in M€
uller
glia conversion into neurons, our results indicate that the
REST pathway is also actively repressing neuronal genes in
M€
uller glia, and probably also in other glia types of the
brain.
The REST complex has been reported to be an evolutionary conserved transcriptional regulator that acts globally
to silence genes (Yeo et al., 2005). There is increasing evidence that the REST complex is responsible for the repression
of neuronal genes in glia. For example, a recent report from
the laboratories of François Guillemot and Magdalena G€otz
demonstrated that REST blocks reprogramming in astrocytes
(Masserdotti et al., 2015). Moreover, Abrajano et al. used
ChIP-chip analysis to show that REST and CoREST occupy
sites at promoters of many neuronal genes in astrocytes and
oligodendrocytes (Abrajano et al., 2009a). REST is also
upregulated after bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)induced astrocyte differentiation and dnREST or shRNA
against REST induce neuronal gene expression in astrocytes
(Koyama et al., 2010). GFAP1 astrocytes derived from
Rest2/2 radial glia-like NPCs co-express many neuronal
genes, like NeuN, MAP2, and Dcx (Soldati et al., 2012).
Our results extend these reports to M€
uller glia and further
suggest that attempts to reprogram astrocytes in the brain
may also find miR-124-9-9* as a useful additional/synergistic
reprogramming factor.

Summary and Future Directions
Here we show for the first time that miR-124-9-9* can reprogram M€
uller glia. Overexpression of these miRNAs resulted
in an upregulation of progenitor and neuronal genes; morphological changes to neuron-like cells; and the expression of
the neuronal markers MAP2 and TUJ1. Moreover, miR-1249-9* in combination with Ascl1 potentiated M€
uller glia
reprogramming, yielding more neurons than with either miR124-9-9* or Ascl1 alone. Furthermore, two established targets
of miR-124-9-9*, Ctdsp1 and Ptbp1, were reduced in M€
uller
glia after miR-124-9-9* expression. Since both are components of the REST complex, we propose that miR-124-9-9*
reprogramming acts via blocking the repression of neuronal
759

genes by the REST pathway. Our results show that a combination of proneural activation and REST repression will more
effectively reprogram mouse M€
uller glia to generate neurons
in vitro.
It is possible that the type of reprogramming that we
have described here in vitro might also be used to stimulate
retinal regeneration in vivo. In zebrafish, a type of regulated
reprogramming occurs after retinal injury, in which the M€uller
glia generate new progeny that act as neuronal progenitors.
One of the early events in this natural reprogramming phenomenon is the expression of Ascl1 in the M€
uller glial cells.
Our results show that miR-124-9-9* can induce Ascl1 expression in the M€
uller glia, suggesting that this may be an initiating event in fish retinal regeneration. We recently reported that
transgenic expression of Ascl1 in M€
uller glia of young mice
endows them with the capacity for regenerating new neurons
after retinal injury (Ueki et al., 2015). The results of the present study indicate that combining miR-124-9-9* might potentiate this in vivo regeneration from mouse M€
uller glia, possibly
allowing regeneration even in adult animals.
