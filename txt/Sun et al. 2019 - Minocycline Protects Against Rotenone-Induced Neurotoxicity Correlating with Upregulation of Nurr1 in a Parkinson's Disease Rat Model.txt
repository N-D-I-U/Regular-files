The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of minocycline in rats with rotenone-induced Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD). The open
field test was performed to determine the motor ability of the rats. Double immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the
expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and Nurr1 in the substantia nigra (SN) of rats. The relative protein levels of TH, Nurr1,
and the total- and phosphorylated-cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) were determined by western blot analysis. The
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) was detected by commercial kits. After exposure to rotenone
for 28 days, rats exhibited decreased ambulation and rearing frequency and prolonged immobility time with loss of TH positive
neurons in the SN. The phosphorylation levels of CREB and Nurr1 expression decreased significantly accompanied with the release
of ROS and NO. Minocycline alleviated the motor deficits of rats lesioned by rotenone and elevated the expression of TH, as well
as suppressing the release of ROS and NO in the SN. That was in line with the elevated phosphorylation levels of CREB and Nurr1
expression. In conclusion, our present study showed minocycline protected against neurotoxicity in a rotenone-induced rat model
of PD, which was correlated with upregulation of Nurr1.

1. Introduction
Parkinson‚Äôs disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disease featured with degeneration of dopaminergic
(DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) [1]. After degeneration of more than 80% of the DA neurons, the clinical
motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, muscular rigidity,
rest tremor, and postural and gait impairment, become
apparent [2]. Levodopa is still the primary treatment for PD
[3]. Enhancing neuroprotection at the early pathogenic stage
is crucial for delaying the development of PD.
Although the pathological mechanisms of PD are not well
understood, it is widely accepted that oxidative stress plays
important roles in the initial degeneration of DA neurons [4].
Oxidative stress is remarkably increased in the brain tissue of
patients with PD [5]. Excessive production of reactive oxygen

species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) triggers cellular damage
through lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation or nitration,
mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA fragmentation [6, 7].
The transcription factor Nurr1 expressed in the DA neurons regulates resistance to oxidative stress and the expression
of TH, a rate limiting enzyme catalyzing neuronal dopamine
synthesis [8, 9]. Mutations in Nurr1 are associated with the
pathogenesis of familial PD cases [10]. Nurr1 deficiency may
lead to impaired DA release, before significant loss of DA
neurons [11]. Nurr1 agonists improve the behavioral deficits in
animal models [12]. Therefore, Nurr1 is a feasible and effective
drug target for neuroprotection in PD.
Minocycline is a semisynthetic tetracycline with high
lipophilicity [13]. In addition to its antimicrobial activity,
it presents a neuroprotective capacity [14]. Several studies
reported that minocycline increased the phosphorylation

2
of the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) in
rodents subjected to ischemia, ùõΩ-amyloid toxicity, and prion
infection [15‚Äì17]. Phosphorylated-CREB could promote the
Nurr1 expression via binding to its promoters [18]. Whether
minocycline influences the expression of these proteins in
degenerating DA neurons remains elusive. Rotenone is an
environmental neurotoxin, which causes oxidative stress and
is widely used in modeling the pathogenesis of PD [19]. Here,
we investigated the effect of minocycline in rotenone-induced
rat models of Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animals and Drugs. Male Wistar rats (weighing 270290 g) were procured from the Experimental Animal Center
of Shandong University (Jinan, Shandong, China). Animal
experiments and procedures were approved by the Animal
Experimentation Ethics Committee of Shandong University.
The rats were allowed free access to food and water ad
libitum, under standard temperature and humidity, with the
12 h light/dark cycle.
Minocycline (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was
dissolved in a 0.9% saline solution (10 mg/ml). Rotenone
(Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in sunflower oil (2 mg/ml).
2.2. Experimental Design. Rats were randomly divided
into four groups labeled as control (no treatment, n=20),
minocycline (daily intraperitoneal injection of minocycline,
30 mg/kg, n=20), rotenone (daily subcutaneous administration of rotenone, 1.5 mg/kg, n=40), and minocycline plus
rotenone (intraperitoneal injection of minocycline one day
before rotenone administration, 30 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg,
respectively, n=40). At the 28th day of the experiment,
the open field test was performed to assess spontaneous
locomotor activity.
2.3. Open Field Test. A square apparatus (80 cm √ó
80 cm√ó40 cm) was divided into 16 equal squares. The
rat was placed in the central area of the open field and
allowed to explore the area freely. Ambulation (the number
of the square that the rat crossed), the number of rearing,
and immobility time were recorded for 3 min. The apparatus
was washed after testing each rat to eliminate the possible
odor left.
2.4. Immunofluorescent Staining and Analysis. After anesthetizing with 10% chloral hydrate (5 ml/kg, intraperitoneal
injection), rats were sacrificed and perfused with saline
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde through the left ventricle of the heart. Brains were obtained and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde overnight and then kept in a 0.1 M
PBS-sucrose solution (20% and 30%) at 4‚àò C until they
were immersed. Samples were embedded in optimal cutting
temperature compound and frozen sections (10 ùúám) were
prepared with a Cryostat Microtome (CM1900, Leica, Solms,
Germany) according to the standard procedures. After incubation with 0.3% Triton X-100 (v/v), sections were blocked
with 10% normal goat serum (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Maryland, WA, USA) and then incubated with

BioMed Research International
rabbit anti-rat anti-TH (1:500 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge,
MA, USA) and mouse anti-rat anti-Nurr1 (1:300 dilution;
Abcam) primary antibodies overnight. After washing with
0.01 M PBS, sections were incubated with FITC-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody and Alexa Fluor 594conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1,000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove, PA, USA).
After washing with 0.01 M PBS, the sections were counterstained with 4Û∏Ä† ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride
(DAPI, 1:10,000 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich) and then examined
under a microscope (BX51, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The
number of immunostaining positive cells was counted by the
Image Pro Plus image analysis software (Media Cybernetics,
Silver Spring, MD, USA) in comparable fields (300x210 um,
3 fields per section x 3 sections per rat) and was presented as
the average cell number per field on each section.
2.5. Western Blot Analysis. The SN tissues were rapidly
dissected from the brain and homogenized with a lysis
buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland). The protein concentration of the supernatant
was determined using the Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL,
USA). A total of 50 ùúág protein was separated by 10%15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto
the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The membrane was incubated
with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-rat antiTH (1:1,000 dilution; Abcam), mouse anti-rat anti-Nurr1
(1:1,000 dilution; Abcam), rabbit anti-rat anti-CREB (1:1,000
dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA),
rabbit anti-rat anti-phospho-CREB (Ser133) (1:1,000 dilution;
Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse anti-rat anti-ùõΩ-actin
(1:10,000 dilution; Proteintech Group Inc.). Subsequently,
the membrane was washed and incubated with horseradish
peroxidase- (HRP-) conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit
IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) secondary antibodies.
Protein bands were detected by the SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.).
The band densities were calculated as the expression ratios of
the target protein to ùõΩ-actin using the ImageJ 1.42q software
(US National Institutes of Health).
2.6. Measurement of ROS and NO Levels in the SN of Rats.
ROS and NO production were measured using a ROS assay
kit and NO assay kit (nitrate reductase method) (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China), respectively.
Briefly, the single cell suspension was prepared from the fresh
SN tissue by the mechanical trituration method. The protein
concentration of the supernatant was determined using the
BCA Protein Assay Kit. 10 uM DCFH-DA was added to the
suspended cells and incubated for 45 min at 37‚àò C. 5 uM DAFFM DA was incubated with the suspended cells for 20 min
at 37‚àò C. After washing with PBS, the fluorescence intensity
was measured by a microplate reader (at 485 nm excitation
and 535 nm emission for ROS and at 495 nm excitation and
515 nm emission for NO). The levels of ROS and NO were
expressed as fluorescence intensity/mg protein and umol/g
protein, respectively.

or the Games-Howell test for post hoc comparison. p<0.05

3. Results
3.1. Minocycline Alleviated Behavioral Deficits in Rats following Rotenone Treatment. The open field test was performed
to evaluate the spontaneous motor ability of the rats (15 rats
in each group). Compared to the control, rats exposed to
rotenone showed an obvious reduction in the number of
ambulation and rearing and prolonged periods of immobility

(‚àó ùëù <0.05, Figure 1). Treatment with minocycline before
rotenone administration increased the number of ambulation
and rearing of rats and shortened the immobility time
(#p<0.05, Figure 1). No obvious differences were observed
between the control group and the minocycline group in
the above indexes. These results indicated that minocycline
might, to some extent, enhance the motor ability of PD rat
models.
3.2. Minocycline Alleviated Oxidative Stress. ROS and NO
assay kits were used to determine the production of ROS
and NO in the SN of rats (n=5 for each group). Our results
showed that rotenone led to a significant increase in ROS
and NO levels compared to control (‚àó ùëù <0.05, Figure 2)
and minocycline treatment before rotenone administration
reversed the increase significantly (# p<0.05, Figure 2). No

obvious differences in ROS or NO levels were observed
between the control group and the minocycline group. These
findings indicated that minocycline inhibited the production
of ROS and NO in the SN of rats treated with rotenone.
3.3. Minocycline Increased the Expression of TH and Nurr1.
The expression of TH and Nurr1 in the SN of rats was
detected by immunofluorescent staining and western blot
analysis. Our results showed that Nurr1 was expressed in TH
positive neurons. After treatment with rotenone, obvious loss
of TH positive neurons and the diminished expression of

Nurr1 were observed in the SN of rats (n=5 for each group,
<0.05, Figures 3(a) and 3(b)), which were alleviated by
minocycline treatment before rotenone administration (n=5
for each group, # p<0.05, Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). Compared to
the control group, the relative protein levels of TH and Nurr1
were significantly decreased in rats exposed to rotenone
(n=5 for each group, ‚àó ùëù <0.05, Figures 3(c) and 3(d)).
Treatment with minocycline significantly increased TH and

expression were observed between the control group and the
minocycline group (n=5 for each group, p>0.05, Figure 3).
These results indicated that minocycline treatment increased
the TH and Nurr1 expression in the SN of rats exposed to
rotenone.
3.4. Minocycline Upregulated the Phosphorylation Level
of CREB. The expression of total-CREB (t-CREB) and
phosphorylated-CREB (p-CREB) in the SN of rats was
detected by western blot analysis. Neither rotenone nor
minocycline produced obvious effect on the expression of
total-CREB. Compared to the control group, the p-CREB/tCREB ratio was significantly reduced in rats treated with
rotenone (n=5 for each group, ‚àó ùëù <0.05, Figure 4), and
this effect was abolished by minocycline treatment (n=5,
#
p<0.05, Figure 4). That indicated minocycline upregulated
the phosphorylation level of CREB.

4. Discussion
The present study indicated that minocycline protected
against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity in a rat model of
PD. It alleviated the motor deficits of rats and increased
the expression of TH and suppressed the oxidative stress in
the SN. That was consistent with the upregulated phosphorylation levels of CREB and Nurr1 expression. TH positive
neurons highly expressing Nurr1 were abundant in the
SN of normal rats. Nurr1 is essential for the development
and maintenance of DA neurons [20]. Interestingly, it also
protects the DA neurons by decreasing the production of
intracellular ROS [21]. NO is associated with increased
dopaminergic damage in Nurr1 heterozygous mice [22].
Similar to other studies [23], we found Nurr1 expression was
remarkably decreased in the SN of rats after exposure to
rotenone. This finding was in line with the loss of TH positive
neurons and the increased oxidative stress. Many studies have

reported that minocycline protects the DA neurons from
neurotoxins [24‚Äì26]. In the present study, we found minocycline treatment before rotenone administration increased the
expression of Nurr1. This was accompanied with decreased
content of ROS and NO and increased TH positive cells.
These results implied that minocycline protected DA neurons
against rotenone neurotoxicity, which was correlated with
upregulation of Nurr1.
CREB plays pleiotropic roles in the nervous system [27].
ROS and NO modulate many signaling targets in the nervous
system, including increasing CREB phosphorylation [28,
29]. In turn, CREB functions as a pivotal upstream integrator of neuroprotective signaling against oxidative stressmediated neuronal cell death [30]. Redundant ROS and NO
clearly result in cellular damage, although other feedback
mechanisms might alleviate their toxic effects. In our study,
decreased CREB phosphorylation was detected in the SN of
rats treated with rotenone, which is similar to the effects of 6OHDA and MPTP [31, 32]. We also found that minocycline
treatment before rotenone administration increased the ratio
of p-CREB/t-CREB. This result is consistent with the in
vivo studies performed under different pathological states
[15‚Äì17]. The Nurr1 gene possesses CAMP-response element
sequences that bind p-CREB to promote its expression [18].
That may partially explain the effect of minocycline in
upregulating the Nurr1 and TH expression.
Although many studies have reported that minocycline
plays neuroprotective roles, it has not been shown to improve
the motor function in patients with early PD in the clinic
[33]. Since most DA neurons would have been degenerated
when patients present motor symptoms, drug delivery at this
stage might be too late. Our results showed that minocycline
early treatment improved the motor deficits of rats suffering
from rotenone toxicity, although the improvement was not
satisfactory. Whether minocycline serves as an auxiliary
treatment deserves further exploration.

5. Conclusions
This study showed minocycline could protect against
rotenone-induced neurotoxicity in a rat model of Parkinson‚Äôs
disease. It alleviated motor deficits and elevated the TH
expression, as well as suppressing the oxidative stress.
That was correlated with upregulation of Nurr1. Whether
minocycline is useful as adjuvant therapy for Parkinson‚Äôs
disease deserves further exploration.
