Summary
The mesencephalic dopamine (mesDA) system is involved
in the control of movement and behavior. The expression
of Pitx3 in the brain is restricted to the mesDA system and
the gene is induced relatively late, at E11.5, a time when
tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) gene expression is initiated. We
show here that, in the Pitx3-deficient aphakia (ak) mouse
mutant, the mesDA system is malformed. Owing to the
developmental failure of mesDA neurons in the lateral field
of the midbrain, mesDA neurons are not found in the SNc
and the projections to the caudate putamen are selectively
lost. However, Pitx3 is expressed in all mesDA neurons in

control animals. Therefore, mesDA neurons react
specifically to the loss of Pitx3. Defects of motor control
where not seen in the ak mice, suggesting that other
neuronal systems compensate for the absence of the
nigrostriatal pathway. However, an overall lower activity
was observed. The results suggest that Pitx3 is specifically
required for the formation of the SNc subfield at the onset
of dopaminergic neuron differentiation.

Introduction

up along the mesencephalic flexure of the ventral
mesencephalon. Ventral midbrain markers are present in this
area prior to Pitx3 and Th. Among the earliest markers of the
region are En1 (Danielian et al., 1996; Wurst et al., 1994), En2
(Hanks et al., 1995), Wnt1 (Danielian et al., 1996), Pax2 (Favor
et al., 1996) and Pax5 (Urbanek et al., 1997). Th expression is
induced at E11.5, 1 day after the induction of the orphan
nuclear hormone receptor Nurr1 (Nr4a2 – Mouse Genome
Informatics) (Law et al., 1992). The expression of Nurr1 is,
however, not restricted to the ventral midbrain but is also
expressed in the dorsal mesencephalon and diencephalon,
where Th is not expressed at this developmental stage (Smidt
et al., 2000). MesDA neurons in Nurr1 knockout mice do not
express Th, Dat (Slc6a3 – Mouse Genome Informatics) and
Vmat2 (Slc18a2 – Mouse Genome Informatics) (Smits et al.,
2003) and are lost after initial generation (Zetterström et al.,
1997; Saucedo-Cardenas et al., 1998). Thus, Nurr1 is part of
a molecular cascade required for neurotransmitter synthesis
and survival.
Additional cascades have been discovered that specify other
properties of the mesDA neuronal phenotype. Recently, the
homeobox genes En1, En2 (Davidson et al., 1988; Simon et
al., 2001) and Lmx1b (Johnson and Tabin, 1997; Dreyer et al.,
1998a; Chen et al., 1998a; Chen et al., 1998b; Tucker et al.,
1999) have been implicated in the development of the mesDA
system (Smidt et al., 2000). En1 and En2 are not required for
the induction of Th, but control the survival of mesDA neurons
in a gene dose-dependent manner (Simon et al., 2001). Lmx1b
is present in the premordial ventral mesencephalon and

The mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) system is involved
in the control of movement and behavior, as shown by the
dramatic consequence of its degeneration in Parkinson’s
disease and its involvement in psychiatric and affective
disorders (Grace et al., 1997). For this reason, the
neurobiology, pharmacology and pathology of the mesDA
system has been investigated extensively for many years.
Although results suggest that dopaminergic neuron
dysfunction may have a genetic component, little is known
about the development of the mesDA system and the
underlying genetic cascades. The early commitment of a
neuronal cell population in the ventral midbrain to the
development of the mesDA system largely depends on the
proper specification of the isthmus (for a review, see Hynes and
Rosenthal, 1999). Therefore, genes involved in boundary
formation affect the emergence of mesDA neurons.
Two key molecules on the anterior side of the isthmus play
an essential role in the commitment of progenitors to mesDA
neuron development. The signaling molecule sonic hedgehog
(Shh), which is generated in the neural plate, diffuses into the
ventral mesencephalon and, together with FGF8, induces cells
at a specific location in the ventral midbrain from which
mesDA neurons later arise (Hynes et al., 1995; Hynes et al.,
1997; Ye et al., 1998; Shamim et al., 1999; Hynes and
Rosenthal., 1999). MesDA neurons, which express tyrosine
hydroxylase (Th) and Pitx3 (Ptx3) (Smidt et al., 1997), first
appear at the most ventral rim of the neuroepithelium, lining

diencephalon at E7.5, and continues to be expressed in the
adult in a limited set of brain structures derived from these
areas, including mesDA neurons (Smidt et al., 2000). Null
mutation of Lmx1b showed that this gene is not required for
the expression of Nurr1 and is not essential for Th induction.
Moreover, Lmx1b-null mutation impairs the proper
development of mesDA neurons, such that the mesDA-specific
homeodomain gene Pitx3 is not expressed in Th-positive cells
in the ventral midbrain (Smidt et al., 2000).
The Pitx3 gene belongs to the Pitx (Ptx) subfamily of pairedlike homeodomain proteins, of which two other members are
known, Pitx1 and Pitx2, which are involved in hindlimb
patterning, mandible development (Lanctot et al., 1999), leftright asymmetry of the body (Lin et al., 1999), pituitary genesis
(Suh et al., 2002) and pituitary hormone regulation (Quirk et
al., 2001; Quentien et al., 2002). Pitx3 is expressed in the eye
and the brain (Semina et al., 1997; Smidt et al., 1997), where
its expression is restricted to mesDA neurons in rodents and
humans (Smidt et al., 1997). The Pitx3 gene is induced at the
same developmental stage as Th and continues to be expressed
in adulthood (Smidt et al., 1997). Although in vitro studies
have suggested that Pitx3 is important for the induction of the
Th gene (Lebel et al., 2001; Cazorla et al., 2000), analysis of
the Lmx1b-null mutant indicated that Pitx3 is not essential for
Th expression (Smidt et al., 2000). Recent reports have shown
that the Pitx3 gene is inactivated in the aphakia (ak) mouse
mutant (Semina et al., 2000; Rieger et al., 2001) and that the
architecture of the midbrain DA system is compromised
(Nunes et al., 2003; van den Munckhof et al., 2003; Hwang
et al., 2003; Burbach et al., 2003). However, the early
developmental fate of mesDA progenitors, and the role of Pitx3
in this, are uncertain. We show that SNc DA neurons are absent
in the ak mice from E12.5 onwards. Pitx3 appears to be an
essential part of a transcription factor cascade required for the
developmental specification of the SNc subpopulation of
mesDA neurons.

Research article
digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probes was performed essentially
according to Schaeren-Wiemers and Gerfin-Moser (SchaerenWiemers and Gerfin-Moser, 1993). Briefly, sections were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 minutes and acetylated with 0.25%
acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine for 10 minutes.
Hybridization was carried out at 72°C in a hybridization solution
containing 50% deionized formamide, 5×SSC, 5×Denhardt’s solution,
250 µg/ml tRNA Baker’s yeast and 500 µg/ml sonificated salmon
sperm DNA. Post-hybridization washes were carried out in 0.2×SSC
for 2 hours at 72°C. DIG was detected with an alkaline phosphataselabeled antibody (Roche, Mannheim) using NBT/BCIP as a substrate.
After DIG in situ hybridization, slides were dehydrated in ethanol,
cleared in xylene and mounted using Entellan. DIG in situ
hybridization was performed with the following probes: a BalI/EcoRI
(bp 915-1137) fragment of the rat Th cDNA (Grima et al., 1985), an
EcoRI/PstI fragment containing bp 1 to 285 of the rat Pitx3 cDNA
(Smidt et al., 1997), a Nurr1 cRNA containing bp 1022 to the 3′ end
of the full-length cDNA (U72354), an En1 fragment containing bp 11842 of the full-length mouse cDNA sequence (L12703), an En2
fragment (BglII/XbaI) containing bp 1351-2101 of the mouse cDNA
sequence (L12705), a Lmx1b fragment (EcoRI) containing the fulllength mouse cDNA sequence, a Ret fragment containing bp 17331281 of the mouse cDNA sequence (X67812), a dopamine transporter
(Dat) fragment (ApaI/HindIII) containing bp 762-1127 of the rat
cDNA sequence (m80570), an aromatic-L-amino acid decarboxylase
(Aadc) fragment containing bp 22-488 of the coding region from the
mouse cDNA, a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (Vmat2) fragment
containing bp 290-799 of the coding region from the mouse cDNA,

Materials and methods
Animals
The Aphakia (ak) strain used has been described previously (Semina
et al., 2000; Rieger et al., 2001). C57Bl/6-Jico were used as control
animals (Charles-River).
Surgery
Six- or 7-day-old C57Bl/6-Jico mice underwent surgery to remove the
eyes. The mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (florane®) 2% and
N2O (carrier-gas) and O2 (75:65% volume, respectively), and the
eyelids were treated with lidocaine as local anesthetic. The animals
were kept at 37°C with a heating mat. The eyelids were opened with
a pair of scissors and the membrane covering the eye was removed
with a micro hook. The eyeball was removed by cutting the nerve and
blood vessel with a scalpel after they had been forced together by the
use of a forceps. The eyelids were glued together with tissue glue
(Histoacryl® (Braun)) applied with a micropipette. The animals
recovered from surgery and did not appear to be affected by the
procedure.
In situ hybridization
The brains of adult animals and E12.5 embryos of wild-type and ak
mice were collected and immediately frozen on dry ice. Sagittal and
coronal sections (16 µm) were cut on a cryostat and collected on
SuperFrost Plus slides (Menzel Gläser). In situ hybridization with

Combined in situ hybridizationimmunohistochemistry
Sections were treated as described above for DIG
hybridization, except that after termination of the
alkaline phosphatase reaction, the sections were
washed twice for 5 minutes in TBS. Then they were
incubated in 0.3% H2O2 in TBS for 30 minutes to
reduce endogenous peroxidase activity, washed twice
for 5 minutes in TBS, blocked with 4% fetal calf
serum in TBS for 30 minutes, washed twice for 5
minutes in TBS, and incubated overnight at room
temperature with either anti Th (Pel-Freez, Arkansas,
USA; 1:1000) in TBST (0.5 M Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 9%
NaCl, 0.5% Triton) or anti Pitx3 (1:500) (Smidt et al.,
2000) in TBST. The next day, sections were washed
three times with TBS for 5 minutes, incubated
for 1 hour with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin in TBST (1:1000), washed three
times with TBS for 5 minutes, incubated for 1 hour
with avidin-biotin-peroxidase reagents (ABC elite kit,
Vector Laboratories, 1:1000) in TBST and washed
with TBS three times for 5 minutes. The slides were
stained with DAB (3,3′-diamino-benzidine) until
background was lightly stained. Slides were washed
twice with demineralized water for 5 minutes,
dehydrated with ethanol and mounted using Entellan.
Immunohistochemistry
PFA (4%)-fixed vibratome sections were used for
direct immunohistochemistry, as described earlier
(Smidt et al., 2000). Immunohistochemistry with
paraffin wax sections was performed as described
earlier for frozen sections (Smidt et al., 2000) with
the following modifications. Sections were
deparaffiniated through xylene and rehydrated through
an ethanol series. Sections were boiled in 0.06 M
sodium citrate (pH 6) for 9 minutes and then allowed
to cool down to room temperature. The following
antibodies were used: polyclonal rabbit anti-Th
(1:1000; PelFreez) and a polyclonal rabbit anti-Pitx3
(1:500) (Smidt et al., 2000).
Nissl staining
Paraffin-embedded coronal midbrain sections (7 µm)
obtained from adult wild-type and ak mice were
mounted on SuperFrost plus slides (Menzel Gläser).
Sections were deparaffinated, rinsed in water, stained
for 10 minutes in 0.5% Cresyl Violet and briefly rinsed
in an acetate buffer, pH 4. The sections were then
differentiated in 96% ethanol for 30 seconds,
dehydrated in 100% ethanol, cleared in xylene and
mounted with Entellan.

Fluorogold retrograde tracing
A ‘David Kopf’ stereotact apparatus with mouse
adaptor (Stoelting, USA) was used for injections in
wild-type and ak mice at the following coordinates for
the dorsal striatum: (bregma=0), 1.1 to anterior, 1.5
lateral. The skull surface was set at vertical position
0, and the injection depth was 3 mm. The animals
were anesthetized with 2.5 µl/g Hypnorm (Janssen; 0.315 mg/ml
fentanyl citrate, 10 mg/ml fluanisone, IP), additionally 0.8 µl/g
dormicum (Roche; 5 mg/ml midazolam, IP) was given 5 minutes
after the Hypnorm injection. During the operation ‘CAF-zalf’
(Apharmo) was applied to the eyes of the wild-type mice to prevent
drying of the eyes. Body temperature was kept at 37°C by placing
the mice on heating mats. The retrograde tracer Fluorogold

(Fluorochrome, USA) was iontophoretically delivered through a
glass micropipette (internal diameter 10-15 µm) filled with 2%
Fluorogold in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3). The tracer was
applied using a midgard 51413 precision current source instrument
[polarity –, 5 µA for 10 minutes (pulse setting 7 seconds on, 7
seconds off) red pen(+) at the ear of the mice, black pen(–) in
Fluorogold solution]. The glass capillaries (1.5 mm OD, 0.86 mm
ID, Borosilicate glass, standard wall with inner filament, Clark
electromedical instruments, Reading, UK) were prepared on a micropipette-puller (Getra, Munchen, Germany) with the following
settings: Heating: 7.5-8, Magnet: 3. The animals were killed 48 hours
after the infusions, and the brains were isolated and fixed for 24 hours
in 4% PFA (fresh) at 4°C. Sections (50 µm) were cut with a
vibratome (Leica) and examined under a fluorescence microscope or
used for additional immunohistochemical experiments.
Climbing test
The test was performed as described (Costall et al., 1978a; Costall et
al., 1978b) except that climbing was scored every 5 minutes for 90
minutes (0=all paws on the floor, 1=2 paws on the cage, 2=all paws
on the cage). None of the animals was injected with drugs.
Medium open field test
The open field consisted of a Plexiglas open cylinder (diameter 20 cm,
height 30 cm) placed on a white plastic board. Locomotor activity was
monitored for 15 minutes using a fully automated observation system
(1.6 frames per second, Ethovision, Noldus Information Technology,
The Netherlands). The animals were used at 3 months of age. The
experiment was performed under normal lighting conditions between
10 am and 3 pm.
Automated quantitative gait analysis
The gait of wild-type and ak mice was analyzed as described
previously (Hamers et al., 2001).

Results and discussion
ak mice are Pitx3 deficient
The Pitx3 gene is expressed solely in mesDA neurons in the
brain (Smidt et al., 1997). Aphakia (ak) mutant mice which
suffer from a eye defect (Varnum and Stevens, 1968), have a
double genomic deletion within the Pitx3 locus (Semina et al.,
2000; Rieger et al., 2001). These deletions are present in the
upstream enhancer region, the promoter area, exon 1 and part
of intron 1. The ak mouse may therefore be considered a nullmutant for the Pitx3 gene. Indeed, Pitx3 expression was not
detectable in mesDA neurons of adult ak mice (Fig. 1A-D) and
E12.5 ak embryos (Fig. 1E,F). This extends earlier findings of
the lack of expression of Pitx3 in the lens (Semina et al., 2000),
showing that the Pitx3 gene is not expressed at all. This
provides the means to study the development of the mesDA
system in the absence of the unique homeodomain gene Pitx3.
Early development of mesDA neurons in ak mice
In order to examine the genesis and developmental fate of
mesDA neurons in the absence of Pitx3, the expression of Th
throughout the entire midbrain was analyzed from E11.5
onwards (Fig. 2). On E11.5, when Th was expressed for the
first time, the distribution of Th-positive neurons in the ventral
midbrain was indistinguishable between wild-type and ak
mice. A thin rim of Th-positive cells was observed in the
ventral midbrain. These cells are thought to originate from the
neuroepithelium lining the ventricular space and to migrate
ventrally by interacting with radial glia cells (Hanaway et al.,
1971; Marchand and Poirier, 1983; Shults et al., 1990; Kawano
et al., 1995; Hall et al., 2003). In line with this, we observed

Pitx3 is essential for early development of the substantia nigra 1149
Th-positive neurons in close contact with fibrillous structures
in paraffin wax sections (data not shown).
The first differences in neuroanatomy were seen on E12.5,
in the rostral part of the Th domain. At this position, the lateral
Th-positive neurons were absent in ak mice. In a more medial
position, Th-positive cells accumulated in a more dorsal field

(Fig. 2 asterisks). In wild-type mice, Th-positive neurons
accumulated in a more lateral position which forms the SNc.
This distinct cell group was absent in E12.5 ak embryos and
onward (Fig. 2, arrows).
As mesDA progenitor neurons start to express Th after they
have migrated to a ventral position in the midbrain, we sought
to determine their fate by analyzing Aadc (Ddc – Mouse
Genome Informatics) expression. Aadc is expressed solely by
catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons (Cooper et al.,
1977) and is first expressed 2 days earlier than Th (Teitelman
et al., 1983). Analysis of sagittal sections of E12.5 wild-type
mice showed that Aadc was expressed in serotonergic neurons
located caudal to the mid-hindbrain border (MHB) and in
midbrain dopaminergic neurons located rostral to the MHB
(Fig. 3A), being expressed over a larger area than Th (Fig. 3B).
In coronal sections from three different levels containing
dopaminergic neurons (Fig. 3C), Aadc-positive neurons were
seen immediately below the neuroepithelium (Fig. 3D-F).
This suggests that the Aadc gene is activated early in the
differentiation of neuroepithelial cells.
Pitx3 was expressed in Aadc-positive neurons located in the
most ventral position in the midbrain, in a pattern similar to Th
expression, but not in Aadc-positive neurons located just below
the neuroepithelium (Fig. 3G-I). These data indicate that Pitx3
affects the terminal differentiation of mesDA neurons and that
it is not involved in either the proliferation or the migration of
neurons from the neuroepithelium to the ventral midbrain.
Architecture of mesDA neurons of adult ak mice
The anatomical architecture of mesDA neurons was analyzed
by comparing the distribution of Th-immunoreactive neurons
in the midbrain of ak and wild-type mice (Fig. 4). The
morphology of the mesDA system of ak mice was dramatically
altered in two aspects: the field of dopaminergic bodies in the
ventral midbrain was smaller (Fig. 4A) and there were fewer
projections to the striatum. (Fig. 4B,C). These findings are
consistent with other findings (Nunes et al., 2003; van den
Munckhof et al., 2003; Hwang et al., 2003). In ak mice, Thpositive neurons were not detected in the SNc. The region of
the VTA was less affected, although in the region where the
SNc and VTA are overlapping, Th positive neurons were also
absent (Fig. 4A). The non-Pitx3 expressing dopamine systems
including the periglomerular dopamine neurons (A16)
located in the olfactory bulb and the tuberohypophycial/
incertohypothalamic dopamine neurons (A11-A14) located in
the hypothalamus were not affected, as analyzed by Th staining

in coronal sections through the brain (data not shown). This
was expected as Pitx3, in contrast to Lmx1b and Nurr1, is
expressed only in mesDA neurons in the brain (Smidt et al.,
1997). Furthermore, the defect of Pitx3 seems to be restricted
to a subset of mesDA neurons. To address the reportedly
limited expression of Pitx3 in a subset of DA neurons and the
compromised survival of these neurons (van den Munckhof et
al., 2003), the overlap in expression of Th and Pitx3 was
investigated in detail by combined in situ hybridization/
immunohistochemistry for transcripts and protein of both Th
and Pitx3 (Fig. 5).
In neurons of the SNc (Fig. 5A) and VTA (Fig. 5B) the
expression of Pitx3 message and Th protein overlapped
completely, as did the expression of Pitx3 protein and Th
message (Fig. 5C,D). Thus, Th and Pitx3 are co-expressed in
mesDA neurons in control animals. In conclusion, mesDA
neurons are selectively affected by Pitx3 deficiency and the
most severely affected neurons are those that normally form
the SNc and a subpopulation of the VTA.
Restricted connectivity of mesDA neurons and
forebrain regions in ak mice
Analysis of sagittal sections immunostained for Th revealed
dramatic changes in the connectivity of the mesDA cell bodies
with main target areas, specifically the caudate putamen (Fig.
4B). In the striatal projection area, Th-positive fibers were

mainly lost in the dorsal caudate putamen. Parts of the medial
forebrain bundle were still visible. These fibers innervated
ventral striatal areas, particularly the nucleus accumbens area
and the olfactory tubercle. The caudate putamen was devoid of
innervating Th-positive axons. This loss of mesDA projections
was seen throughout the caudate putamen (Fig. 4C).
In order to determine whether mesDA neurons in the SNc
were absent in ak mice or no longer expressed Th, Nissl staining
was performed (Fig. 6A). Sections were compared to adjacent
sections stained for Th (Fig. 6B). In ak mice, particularly DA
neurons in the lateral part of the SNc were absent (Fig. 6A, parts
a,b,a′,b′) and the density of DA cells in the medial part of the
SNc (Fig 6A, parts c,d,c′,d′) was reduced. Taken together, the
data indicate that a null mutation of the Pitx3 gene results in the
absence of mesDA neurons in the SNc. Moreover, when present
the mesDA neurons in the VTA of ak mice had an altered

morphology (Fig. 6A,B, parts e-h; indicated by arrows in g,h),
consistent with data from a recenlty published study (Hwang et
al., 2003). This indicates that mesDA neurons of the SNc and
the VTA, differ in their dependence on Pitx3 expression. The
loss of neurons in the ak brain results in altered mesDA
projections to the caudate putamen.
To determine whether projections between the dorsal
caudate putamen and the midbrain were still present in ak mice,
retrograde tracing studies with fluorogold were performed in
the dorsal caudate putamen. In wild-type mice, fluorogoldlabeled neurons were detected in the SNc and the VTA (Fig.
7A). These neurons were positive for Pitx3, confirming that
these were mesDA neurons. In the ak mice, such neurons were
not detected in the mesencephalic field: of all sections, only
one neuron containing fluorogold was found (Fig. 7B). This
shows that these projections were absent in the ak mice.

their neurotransmitter phenotype. To determine whether other
genes required for the neurotransmitter phenotype were
affected by the loss of Pitx3, the expression of Dat, Vmat2,
Aadc and D2r (Drd2 – Mouse Genome Informatics) was
analyzed in neurons of SNc (Fig. 8A) and VTA (Fig. 8B). The
transcripts were present in the few mesDA neurons detected in
the ak brain. In addition, expression of other mesDA associated
markers including cholecystokinin (Cck), the neurotensin
receptor 1 (Ntr1), alpha synuclein, Nurr1, Lmx1b, En1, En2,
Ret and Nli was analyzed (Fig. 8 and not shown) in ak and
wild-type mesDA neurons. These results indicated that all the
genes involved in the DA synthesis, release pathway and
developmental pathway are retained in the VTA-neurons in the
ak mice. This demonstrates that the SNc neurons are lost and
that the detected mesDA neurons probably display the normal
DA phenotype.

Gene expression in mesDA neurons of ak mice
Nurr1 is involved in establishing the DA phenotype of mesDA
neurons (Zetterström et al., 1997; Saucedo-Cardenas et al.,
1998), and experiments with Nurr1 knockout mice showed that
the expression of Th in mesDA neurons requires Nurr1. In
contrast to Nurr1 knockout mice, in ak mice Th was expressed
in mesDA neurons when present, suggesting that they retain

Behavioral characteristics of ak mice
To investigate the ak mice for deficiencies in the dopaminergic
neuron-associated behaviors we compared ak mice with wildtype and blinded wild-type mice, made blind on postnatal
day 6-7 (P6-7). Despite the absence of dopamine-mediated
innervation of the caudate putamen, no altered posture, or
walking pattern or tremor was detected in the ak mice. This
suggested that motor control itself is not
affected in ak mice. However, ak mice showed
aberrant spontaneous behavior in a ‘climbing
test’, developed to evaluate dopaminergic
neuron activity in the striatum (Costall et al.,
1978a; Costall et al., 1978b). Both blind-mice
and ak mutants had increased climbing
behavior compared with controls (Fig. 9) The
ak mutants had higher activity scores than the
blind controls, but the difference was not
statistically significant; however, the ak mice
displayed lower activity than the blinded
controls and normal controls in an open field
(Fig. 9B). Together, these data suggest that the
altered organization and connectivity in the ak
mesDA system causes hyperactivation of the
nucleus accumbens area, resulting in increased
climbing behavior, and hypoactivation of the
caudate putamen, resulting in lower overall
activity levels. Moreover, it was striking that

Pitx3 is essential for early development of the substantia nigra 1153
only the motor output and not the motor skills were affected.
Thus, the neuroanatomical aberrations in the ak-mutant are
reflected by behavioral changes. Interestingly, the ak mice had
lower overall motor output, consistent with data from other
mesDA-lesion animal models. The hyperactivation of the
nucleus accumbens in relation to the hypoactivity of the
caudate putamen seems a unique feature of the ak animal,
suggesting that the ak mice can be regarded as a new interesting
model of mesDA dysfunction.
In conclusion, in this study we demonstrated that the ak
mouse can be considered as a Pitx3 knockout. Specific changes
occur in the mesDA system as a result of the loss of Pitx3
expression, resulting in fewer mesDA neurons in the lateral
SNc, fewer projections to the caudate putamen and an altered
morphology of VTA neurons. These results suggest that
differences in Pitx3-dependence exists. Different models for
cell genesis and migration in the midbrain have been described
(Fig. 10A). The first model (Kawano et al., 1995) (Fig. 10A,
model 1) states that mesDA precursors are generated in the
neuroepithelium of the medial part of the midbrain and migrate
to the ventral side, where some of these neurons migrate
laterally to form the SNc. In this model, Pitx3 could play a role

in the lateral migration of neurons that form the SNc as Pitx3
is expressed in the ventral field of the midbrain. This is,
however, unlikely because we found that on E11.5 the
complete primordial mesDA neuronal field was present in the
wild-type and in the ak mice, indicating that according to this
model Pitx3 cannot be involved in either lateral or ventral
migration events. In addition, Aadc-positive neurons were
present in lateral positions in the dorsal midbrain field, just
below the neuroepithelium. If Aadc-positive neurons in this
position function as mesDA precursors, then precursors would
have to be generated in lateral midbrain positions. Therefore,
our data suggest that this model is unlikely. In the second
model, precursors are formed in the dorsal parts of the
midbrain, just below the ventricular zone where cell division
takes place (Hanaway et al., 1971) (Fig. 10A, model 2). The
VTA neurons and the medial SN are generated from the medial
ventral one-third of the basal plate and migrate ventrally in
an ‘inverted fountain’ shape pattern. The neurons forming
the more lateral SN are generated from a more lateral
neuroepithelial patch and migrate perpendicular to the
ventricle. The precursors start to display the full dopaminergic
phenotype when they arrive in the ventral field; at this point Th

and Pitx3 expression can be detected. Our data for Th neurons
present on E11.5 and Aadc expression are in line with these
observations. In this model, Pitx3 does not play a role in the
initial formation of mesDA neurons because it is not expressed
in the assumed precursor cells. This suggests that Pitx3 is
essential in the final step of differentiation and that loss of Pitx3
is lethal to the neurons that should develop into the SNc,
because we observed neuron loss already on E12.5 (Fig. 10B).
The ak mutant can serve as a model for developmental
disorders related to the mesDA system in humans. Moreover,
it will provide tools to unravel how mesDA neurons acquire
the specific characteristics and connectivity that distinguish
this neuronal system from other dopaminergic neurons in the
central nervous system. Knowledge about these processes may
pinpoint candidate genes of interest to screen in human
populations with disorders of dopaminergic neuron function.
Finally, the behavioral characteristics of these mice may open
new avenues to delineate novel aspects of the behavioral
pharmacology of dopamine.
