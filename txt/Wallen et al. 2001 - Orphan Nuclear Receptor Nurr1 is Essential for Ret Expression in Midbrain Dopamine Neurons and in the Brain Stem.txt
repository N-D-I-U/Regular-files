The orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 is essential for development of midbrain dopamine (DA) cells. In Nurr1-deficient mice, DA precursor cells fail to migrate normally, are
unable to innervate target areas, and only transiently express DA cell marker genes. In the search for Nurr1regulated genes that might explain this developmental
phenotype, we found that expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret is deregulated in these cells of Nurr1deficient embryos. In addition, our analyses establish
Nurr1 as an early marker for the dorsal motor nucleus
(DMN) of the vagus nerve. Interestingly, Ret expression is
absent also in these cells in Nurr1-targeted mice. Neuronal innervation of vagus nerve target areas appeared normal apart from a subtle disorganization of the DMN-derived nerve fibers. In conclusion, regulation of Ret by
Nurr1 in midbrain DA neurons and in the DMN has implications for both embryonal development and adult physiology in which signaling by neurotrophic factors plays
important roles.

INTRODUCTION
Nuclear receptors are ligand-activated transcription
factors that regulate gene expression by binding to specific hormone-response elements in the vicinity of regulated target genes. These evolutionarily related proteins include receptors for lipophilic ligands such as
steroid hormones, retinoids, vitamin D, and thyroid
hormone, signaling molecules whose activities are critical in cell fate determination, morphogenesis, and
adult physiology (Mangelsdorf et al., 1995). Moreover,
the family also includes a large group of orphan receptors which lack identified ligands and thus indicate the

existence of novel and as yet uncharacterized signaling
pathways (Giguère, 1999).
Nurr1 (nur-related factor 1; NR4A2) is an orphan
nuclear receptor which is widely expressed in both the
developing and the adult central nervous system (Law
et al., 1992; Zetterström et al., 1996a,b). Expression of
Nurr1 in the mouse is detected already at embryonic
day (E) 10.5 in the ventral midbrain (VMB), which is the
region where mesencephalic dopamine (DA) neurons
develop (Zetterström et al., 1997). These cells play fundamental roles in motor control, mechanisms of reward, and a number of other neural processes. Importantly, dopaminergic neurons degenerate in patients
with Parkinson’s disease and disturbances in DA neurotransmission are tightly linked to disorders such as
schizophrenia and drug addiction. Previous studies in
mice, in which the gene encoding Nurr1 has been targeted, revealed that Nurr1 is essential for DA cell development (Castillo et al., 1998; Saucedo-Cardenas et al.,
1998; Zetterström et al., 1997). Analyses demonstrated
that Nurr1, which is first detected immediately peripheral to the ventricular zone of proliferating progenitor
cells, is required for DA cell migration and axonal target
area innervation (Wallén et al., 1999). At birth, increased
cell death is observed in the ventral midbrain of Nurr1deficient mice and dopaminergic markers fail to be
detected (Saucedo-Cardenas et al., 1998; Wallén et al.,
1999; Zetterström et al., 1997). Nurr1 is expressed also in
adult DA neurons, suggesting that Nurr1 continues to
influence the function of these cells during postnatal
development and adulthood (Zetterström et al.,
1996a,b). Indeed, Nurr1 has been shown to regulate
genes of importance for DA neurotransmission, includ-

649

ing the DA transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH;
Sacchetti et al., 2001; Sakurada et al., 1999; Schimmel et
al., 1999; Zetterström et al., 1997). In contrast, Nurr1regulated target genes that can explain the developmental DA cell phenotype remain to be identified.
Ret is a protein tyrosine kinase and a critical signal
transducing subunit of receptors for glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and related neurotrophic factors (Baloh et al., 2000). Ret gene targeting in
mice results in early postnatal death due to developmental defects in, e.g., the kidneys and peripheral nervous system (Durbec et al., 1996; Schuchardt et al., 1994).
Ret is also expressed in the dopaminergic neurons and
GDNF and related factors promote their survival both
in vitro and in vivo (Beck et al., 1995; Hoffer et al., 1994;
Lin et al., 1993; Sauer et al., 1995; Strömberg et al., 1993;
Tomac et al., 1995; Trupp et al., 1996). Although DA cells
are generated in Ret-targeted mice (Marcos and Pachnis, 1996) signaling by Ret might be essential for the
correct maturation of these cells as well as for functions
in mature dopaminergic neurons. Indeed, several studies have indicated that Ret ligands are expressed already in the developing striatum and play important
roles both in developing and in mature DA cells (Golden et al., 1999; Granholm et al., 2000; Lin et al., 1993;
Messer et al., 2000; Strömberg et al., 1993).
Previous studies demonstrated that Nurr1 is required
for sustained gene expression of dopaminergic markers,
but that many genes are initially expressed even in the
absence of Nurr1. Importantly, these include Ptx3, Engrailed, and Lmx1b, transcription factors previously
implicated in dopaminergic development (SaucedoCardenas et al., 1998; Simon et al., 2000; Smidt et al.,
1997, 2000; Wallén et al., 1999). Thus, an important goal
is to identify genes that are regulated by Nurr1 and may
explain defective DA neuron development in Nurr1null mice. In this report we demonstrate that Ret, which
is expressed soon after Nurr1 in the developing midbrain, fails to be induced in the Nurr1 mutant DA
precursor cells and in the brain stem, where Nurr1 and
Ret are colocalized in the dorsal motor nucleus (DMN)
of the vagus nerve.

RESULTS
Nurr1 Protein Expression in the Ventral Midbrain
Nurr1 mRNA expression in the mouse has previously been analyzed by in situ hybridization (ISH).
Using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the
Nurr1 carboxy-terminal domain, Nurr1 immunoreac-

Wallén et al.

tivity (IR) was detected in the E12.5 mouse embryonal
VMB. Distinct nuclear labeling outside the ventricular
zone correlates well with the distribution of Nurr1
mRNA (Fig. 1A). The corresponding region in the
Nurr1 mutant brain shows no Nurr1-specific IR (Fig.
1A⬘), demonstrating the specificity of the antibody. As
expected, no tissue in the Nurr1 mutant embryo is
positive for Nurr1-specific IR. Aldehyde dehydrogenase I (RaldhI, also known as AHD2; Lindahl and
Evces, 1984) has been suggested as a marker for proliferating dopaminergic progenitors (Wallén et al., 1999)
and is expressed in both the proliferating cells in the
ventricular zone and the mantle layer (Fig. 1B). Codetection of Nurr1 and RaldhI shows strong cytoplasmic
RaldhI IR in the proliferative ventricular zone as well as
in the mantle layer of differentiating Nurr1-expressing
cells. Nurr1 and RaldhI IR are perfectly colocalized in
cells outside of the ventricular zone, firmly establishing
RaldhI as a marker for dopaminergic progenitors (Figs.
1C and 1D). Colocalization of nuclear Nurr1 and cytoplasmic TH IR is identified in cells that have migrated
farther from the ventricular zone (Figs. 1E and 1F).
Ret and GFR␣1 Expression in VMB of Nurr1
Mutant Mice
In the search for Nurr1-regulated genes that might
contribute to the Nurr1-deficient DA cell phenotype, we
analyzed Ret and GFR␣1 expression. Ret mRNA expression can be detected in VMB by ISH in a pattern
that is similar to that of TH mRNA at E11.5 (Fig. 2). At
this stage, Nurr1 mRNA is expressed in a similar domain in the medial VMB and, additionally, in less mature cells closer to the ventricular cell layer (Fig. 2A). In
the Nurr1 mutant, medial VMB cells can be detected
with a probe that recognizes a transcript originating
from the disrupted Nurr1 locus (Fig. 2B; Wallén et al.,
1999). TH and Ret are both induced at around E11.5, 1
day after the appearance of Nurr1 (Figs. 2C and 2E).
Already at this early stage of development, Nurr1 deficiency results in the loss of Ret mRNA expression (Fig.
2F). Notably, Ret can still be detected in developing
midbrain motor neurons (Fig. 2F), which normally are
located lateral to the DA cells and are intact in the
Nurr1 mutant midbrain (Wallén et al., 1999). Analyses
of VMB by ISH at several different developmental
stages (E13.5, E16.5, and newborn) reveal that Ret fails
to be expressed in developing DA cells in Nurr1 mutant
mice. This finding was also confirmed by reverse transcriptase-coupled polymerase chain reaction of dissected VMB from wild-type and Nurr1-deficient embryos, respectively (data not shown). Thus, in addition

region of Nurr1, specific nuclear IR (red) can be detected in the medial VMB outside the ventricular zone of the wild-type embryo (A), whereas
no labeling is detected in the corresponding region of the Nurr1 mutant (A⬘). A RaldhI-specific antibody shows cytoplasmic IR (green) in both
the ventricular and the periventricular zones in the same region (B). Double labeling for these two markers (Nurr1 in red and RaldhI in green)

Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ (right) embryos showing expression patterns of Nurr1 (A and B; detection with the probe that recognizes also the disrupted Nurr1
transcript), TH (C and D), Ret (E and F), and GFR␣1 (G and H). As previously described, TH is not detected in the Nurr1 mutant midbrain (D).
In the Nurr1 ⫹/⫹, Ret is detected in medial ventral midbrain DA cells as well as in the laterally located motor neurons (E). The Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ VMB
fails to display Ret expression in the medial cells, while it can be detected in the laterally located motor neurons (F). In contrast, at this stage
GFR␣1 appears in the VMB cells in both the Nurr1 ⫹/⫹ (G) and the Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ (H) embryos. Scale bar: 200 ␮m. 3V, third ventricle; VZ, ventricular

to TH (Fig. 2D), Ret is a second gene that is deregulated
already from the earliest stages in the Nurr1 mutant
medial VMB, where DA cells normally develop. In contrast, GFR␣1 is induced even in the absence of Nurr1
(Figs. 2G and 2H) although this expression, similar to

other dopaminergic markers, is abolished at later stages
(E16.5) of development in mutant animals. In conclusion, impaired Ret mRNA expression in VMB DA neurons represents an early deficiency of Nurr1 gene-targeted embryos.

(right) pups showing the mRNA expression of Nurr1 (A and B),
ChAT (C and D), Phox2a (E and F), and Ret (G and H). In the newborn
pup, Nurr1 can easily be detected in the DMN of the vagus nerve,
whereas no labeling is detected in the ventrally located hypoglossus
nucleus (A). In the mutant pup, the probe that recognizes the disrupted transcript labels the DMN, demonstrating the presence of
these cells (B). Also, labeling with the markers ChAT (E and F) and
Phox2a (E and F) appears normal in the Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ compared to the
Nurr1 ⫹/⫹. In contrast to the wild-type DMN, Ret cannot be detected in
the Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ nucleus at this stage (G and H). Scale bar: 400 ␮m. 4V,
fourth ventricle; DMN, dorsal motor nucleus; HyN, hypoglossal nucleus.

Nurr1 and Ret Expression in the Brain Stem
The results suggest that Nurr1 may be regulating Ret
mRNA expression also at other sites where Nurr1 and
Ret are coexpressed. Ret is expressed in cranial and
spinal motor neurons. In the newborn mouse, Nurr1
was detected in the cranial DMN of the vagus nerve
(Fig. 3A). In addition to Ret (Fig. 3G), this cholinergic
nucleus also expresses choline acetyl transferase
(ChAT; Fig. 3C) and the homeobox transcription factor
Phox2a (Fig. 3E) (Tiveron et al., 1996). Both ChAT and

653
Ret are also expressed in the more ventrally localized
hypoglossal nucleus. In Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ brain stem, the DMN
can be detected with the probe that specifically recognizes the disrupted Nurr1 transcript (Fig. 3B). Also,
ChAT and Phox2a are expressed in these cells even in
Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ brains at birth, demonstrating that the generation of these cells does not require Nurr1 (Figs. 3D and
3F). However, neither Ret mRNA nor protein can be
detected in Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ DMN (Fig. 3H, data not shown)
showing the requirement of Nurr1 for Ret expression at
this stage.
Nurr1 expression in the brain stem was analyzed
during development. Colocalization studies at E10.5 of
Nurr1 with markers for somatic hypoglossal neurons
(HB9 and Islet 1) and visceral motor neurons (Islet 1)
(Briscoe et al., 2000; Ericson et al., 1997; Tsuchida et al.,
1994) demonstrated that while Nurr1 is not expressed
in hypoglossal cells (Fig. 4A), it is expressed already at
this stage in dorsally migrating Islet 1-expressing visceral motor neurons (Fig. 4B). Nurr1 expression continues at E13.5 as the visceral motor neurons are detected
at a more lateral site close to the fourth ventricle (Fig.
4C). At this stage, Islet1 is almost completely downregulated in the DMN (Fig. 4C). Some weakly Nurr1positive cells can also be detected in the area of the
hypoglossal nucleus. In the Nurr1 mutant hindbrain,
DMN Islet 1-positive cells are present (E12.5) and are
localized lateral to the fourth ventricle at a normal
location (Fig. 4D). Nurr1 is thus an early molecular
marker for DMN cells, but Nurr1 deficiency does not
lead to an apparent abnormal cellularity of this nucleus.
In the wild-type embryo, Nurr1 and Ret mRNA expression can be detected at E13.5 in the DMN (Figs. 5A
and 5B). Although the disrupted Nurr1 transcript generated in the Nurr1 mutants can be detected (Fig. 5C),
demonstrating the presence of the DMN cells, Ret expression is below detection level in the Nurr1 mutant
DMN (Fig. 5D). Similarly, at E16.5 Ret expression is
detected in the wild-type DMN, but is absent in Nurr1
mutant embryos (Figs. 5E–5H). Ret expression is normal in the ventral horns of the spinal cord and ureteric
buds of the kidney, sites where Ret and Nurr1 are not
coexpressed (data not shown). In conclusion, Ret expression is dependent on Nurr1 already from early
developmental stages in both regions where these two
genes are colocalized.

colocalization is detected (A). Nurr1-immunoreactive cells (marked by arrows) are mainly detected dorsal to the HB9-reactive somatic motor
neurons that will form the hypoglossal nucleus. Nurr1 does colocalize with Islet 1 (B; yellow cells marked with arrows) in cells negative for HB9
(compare A and B), i.e., visceral motor neurons. At E13.5, the visceral DMN has formed lateral to the fourth ventricle and is positive for Nurr1,
whereas Islet 1 is almost completely down-regulated (C). In the Nurr1 mutant brain stem, the DMN is present as shown by Islet 1 IR at E12.5

of the DMN is by the probe that recognizes the disrupted Nurr1
transcript (C). No Ret signal is detected in the Nurr1 mutant DMN,
but can be seen in the hypoglossal nucleus (D). Similarly, at E16.5, the
DMN is recognized by ISH for Nurr1 in the wild-type and mutant

655
deregulation of Ret and possibly other genes might
result in a functional deficiency of the vagus nerve or in
its ability to correctly innervate peripheral targets. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis localized a strong
Nurr1 expression in the DMN at E13.5 (Fig. 4), whereas
a weaker expression could be detected in the nucleus
ambiguus, an additional cranial nucleus which contributes efferents to the vagus nerve. In newborn mice,
Nurr1 expression was detected only in the DMN (Fig. 3,
data not shown).
Although the vagus nerve could be visualized by
immunolabeling for the general neuronal marker
pgp9.5 in both wild-type and Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ embryos at
E15.5 (Figs. 6A and 6B), it was important to specifically
analyze DMN efferent fibers, which correspond to
about 20% of total vagus nerve fibers. For this reason,
mice heterozygous for an insertion of a tau-lacZ reporter gene in the locus of the Nkx6.2 gene were interbred with Nurr1 heterozygous mice. Nkx6.2 encodes a
homeodomain transcription factor expressed in the nucleus ambiguus and DMN, but not in other neurons of
the vagus nerve (J.E., unpublished results; Qiu et al.,
1998). As expected, a subset of pgp9.5-positive fibers
(Fig. 6A) in horizontal cross sections at E15.5 show IR
for lacZ-encoded ␤-galactosidase protein in Nkx6.2 ⫹/⫺:
Nurr1 ⫹/⫹ nerve bundles (Fig. 6C). The pattern is virtually identical in Nkx6.2 ⫹/⫺:Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ nerves, indicating
no gross outgrowth deficiency of vagus nerve efferents
(Fig. 6D). However, whole-mount X-gal staining at
E12.5 revealed a subtle abnormality characterized by
disorganized fiber tracts at the cranial nuclei exit points
(Figs. 6E– 6H) in Nkx6.2 ⫹/⫺:Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ embryos. Although the same number of fibers are present in both
genotypes, they appear consistently extended in length
in the Nkx6.2 ⫹/⫺:Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ (n ⫽ 3/3), whereas no
Nkx6.2 ⫹/⫺:Nurr1 ⫹/⫹ embryos show this phenotype (n ⫽
0/4). In these comparative analyses, the differences
between the wild-type and the mutant embryos were
confirmed by at least two observers blind to the genotype at the time of evaluation. In conclusion, although
slightly distorted, no severe abnormality in the formation of vagus nerve efferent fibers is apparent in Nurr1null mutant mice.
Ganglia of the lungs, heart, and gastrointestinal tract

fibers. To analyze innervation from the vagus nerve,
pgp9.5 was used as a general neuronal marker, whereas
cholinergic innervation was detected by using an assay
that detects acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity as
well as IHC to vesicular acetylcholine transferase
(VAChT) located in nerve terminals. Screening of target
areas in lungs, esophagus, intestines (Fig. 7), and heart
(not shown) for these markers revealed no abnormalities in E18.5 or newborn Nurr1 mutant animals. In the
walls of lung bronchi, neuronal innervation of smooth
muscle was detected by pgp9.5 and acetylcholine analyses (Figs. 7A, 7G, and 7M) and appeared normal in the
mutant mice (Figs. 7D, 7J, and 7P). Also in the esophagus and intestines, neuronal innervation was normal as
detected by pgp9.5 IR (Figs. 7B, 7C, 7E, and 7F), AChE
assay (Figs. 7H, 7I, 7K, and 7L), and VAChT IR (Figs.
7N, 7O, 7Q, and 7R) in myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexuses
of external muscle wall and the Meissner’s plexuses of
the submucosa. In the wild-type esophagus and intestines, VAChT IR was also detected in the mucosal epithelium (Figs. 7S and 7T). Notably, in the esophagus,
this VAChT IR was not detected to the same extent in
the Nurr1 mutant pups (Fig. 7U), demonstrating an
abnormality in this cell layer.

DISCUSSION
Recently, proteins important for DA cell neurotransmission, including TH and dopamine transporter, were
shown to be regulated by Nurr1 in cells cultured in vitro
(Sacchetti et al., 2001; Sakurada et al., 1999; Schimmel et
al., 1999). Regulation of TH is also manifested by the
complete absence of expression in the Nurr1 mutant
VMB. However, the severe developmental phenotype
characterized by loss of dopaminergic markers, defective DA cell migration, and target area innervation, as
well as early postnatal death, emphasizes the importance of identifying additional deregulated effector
genes (Castillo et al., 1998; Le et al., 1999a; SaucedoCardenas et al., 1998; Wallén et al., 1999; Zetterström et
al., 1997). The results shown here represent the identification of the first Nurr1-regulated gene that is not
related to the DA neurotransmitter phenotype but may
be more directly linked to Nurr1 functions in the postnatal development of DA neurons and other functions
in mature DA cells.
The regulation may be either direct or mediated via
other transcription factors whose expression is regulated by Nurr1. Our preliminary characterization has
not revealed a direct regulation of the Ret promoter in
several cell lines transiently transfected with Nurr1.

657
Also, the endogenous Ret gene failed to be induced in
these cell lines. However, the possibility that Nurr1 is
binding to the Ret promoter and affecting its activity
cannot be excluded from these experiments since additional regulatory regions not included in our reporter
gene constructs may be required. Moreover, additional
cell-type-specific factors not present in the tested cell
lines may be essential for Nurr1-induced Ret expression. It is also possible that an as yet unidentified ligand
not present in our in vitro culture experiments is required for Nurr1-dependent induction of the Ret gene.
Can deregulated Ret gene expression explain aspects
of the Nurr1 mutant phenotype? As described, development of DA cells is severely affected in Nurr1 mutant
mice and DA cell markers are not detected in VMB at
birth in these animals. In contrast, DA neurons are
generated in Ret-deficient animals (Marcos and Pachnis, 1996). However, detailed analyses of DA cell number, cell maturation, and the extent of target area innervation have not been reported. Thus, while deregulated
Ret cannot alone explain the severe developmental deficiencies apparent in Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ VMB, it remains possible that the absence of Ret may result in more subtle
effects, e.g., on innervation density and/or axonal
sprouting. Indeed, the Ret ligand GDNF is important
for axonal sprouting upon striatal injury, and exogenously administered GDNF induces sprouting of DA
neurons (Batchelor et al., 2000; Tomac et al., 1995). Moreover, transplantation of cells into adult striata have
demonstrated that DA neurons from GDNF-deficient
mice are severely impaired in their ability to survive
and innervate host striatal tissue (Granholm et al., 2000).
These latter results indicate that Ret is influencing both
postnatal survival and innervation. Such postnatal
functions have not yet been possible to elucidate in
knockout models since Ret ⫺/⫺ as well as Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ mice
die at an early postnatal age. In conclusion, Nurr1 is
required for the embryonic expression of Ret and it
seems likely that sustained Ret expression is dependent
on the continuing postnatal expression of Nurr1. Nurr1
might thereby influence Ret-dependent development as
well as postnatal Ret-dependent functions in DA cells.
It is well established that signaling via Ret promotes
a robust survival pathway in many cell types, including
VMB DA cells (Beck et al., 1995; Hoffer et al., 1994; Lin
et al., 1993; Oppenheim et al., 1995; Sauer et al., 1995;
Tomac et al., 1995; Williams et al., 1996; Yan et al., 1995).
In models of Parkinson’s disease in both rodents and
primates, Ret ligands such as GDNF are efficiently influencing survival of DA cells and may likely become
important in future therapies for Parkinson’s disease
(Björklund et al., 2000; Kordower et al., 2000; Olson,

658

Wallén et al.

Ret Dependent on Nurr1 in Dopamine Neurons and Brain

2000). We propose that Nurr1 may influence responsiveness to these factors by affecting Ret gene expression. Since Nurr1 is an orphan receptor that may be
regulated by as yet unidentified ligands it can be speculated that such molecules may promote survival of DA
cells and stimulate DA nerve fiber growth by sensitizing DA cells to endogenous Ret ligands. Indeed, relatively small increases in the expression of the Ret coreceptor GFR␣1 have been shown to markedly enhance
sensitivity to GDNF in superior cervical ganglion cells
(Heng et al., 2000). Conversely, GFR␣1 ⫹/⫺ mice are significantly less able to respond to GDNF as shown by the
inability of GDNF preparations to counteract the effects
of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusions in
GFR␣1 heterozygotes (Tomac et al., 2000). These observations support the possibility that modulation of Ret
expression by Nurr1 could significantly affect cell survival via Ret signaling in vivo. Interestingly, this possibility is strengthened by the observation that Nurr1
heterozygous animals are more sensitive to the effects
of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, a neurotoxin that selectively induces DA cell death (Le et al.,
1999b).
In addition to early onset of Nurr1 expression in
midbrain DA cells, we show here that Nurr1 can be
detected already at E10.5 in visceral motor neurons of
DMN of the vagus nerve. Also in this brain nucleus, Ret
expression is colocalized with Nurr1 and dependent on
its expression even from early developmental stages.
This finding reveals the first Nurr1 abnormality that is
independent of functions in the mesencephalic DA system. The analyses of the vagus nerve fibers derived
from the DMN showed a subtle disorganization while
the cholinergic target area innervation appeared normal. Interestingly, a clear decrease in VAChT IR was
apparent in the epithelium of the esophagus mucosa.
This region is not directly innervated and further analysis is required to establish the origin and identity of
the VAChT IR. However, this defect was specific to
Nurr1 mutant perinatal animals and therefore it must
be directly linked to the Nurr1 deficiency. As Nurr1 is

659
not expressed in the esophagus or the enteric ganglia, it
seems likely that defective VAChT IR results from the
lack of Nurr1 in the DMN. In fact, the pattern of decreased VAChT IR supports this assumption. Cholinergic innervation derived from DMN is nonuniform
with more extensive innervation occurring in posterior
abdominal levels of the esophagus (Sang and Young,
1998). Strikingly, decreased VAChT expression in
Nurr1-null mice was mainly observed at abdominal
and not at cervical levels, in good agreement with the
pattern of vagus nerve innervation.
Agenesis of DA neurons in Nurr1 knockout mice is
unlikely to be the explanation for the early postnatal
death of mutant animals. Nurr1 knockout mice can
easily be identified due to lack of milk in their stomachs. Furthermore, milk has not been detected in the
upper gastrointestinal tract in newborn Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ animals (our unpublished observation), demonstrating
that Nurr1-null mice are unable to feed or are not fed by
their mothers. It seems unlikely, however, that the subtle defect of esophageal mucosa is the reason for the
inability to feed. Notably, the DMN is also essential for
normal breathing in a circuitry also involving the nucleus ambiguus (Feldman et al., 1986), an additional
brain-stem region where Nurr1 is transiently expressed
during development. Accordingly, Nurr1 might have
important functions associated with respiration, which
could also explain the early lethality of newborn mutant
pups. It is also interesting to note that Ret deficiency
results in abnormal respiration (Burton et al., 1997). It
will thus be important to specifically analyze breathing
and oxygenation in Nurr1-null mice.
Deficient Ret mRNA expression in Nurr1 mutant
mice in two defined brain nuclei identifies the first
deregulated gene that is not directly related to DA
neurotransmitter functions. Although this target gene
cannot explain the severe DA cell developmental deficiencies observed in Nurr1 knockout mice, the results
link Nurr1 to novel functions associated with cell survival and other activities exerted by ligands utilizing
Ret as their signaling receptor subunit in cells where

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
Immunohistochemistry
Animals
The generation of Nurr1 mutant mice was described
previously (Zetterström et al., 1997). Nurr1 heterozygous females were bred with Nkx6.2-tau-lacZ (J.E., unpublished data) males for generation of mice heterozygous for the two mutations and these were in turn
crossed with Nurr1 heterozygous mice for generation of
Nkx6.2-tau-lacZ ⫹/⫺:Nurr1 ⫹/⫹ and Nkx6.2-tau-lacZ ⫹/⫺:
Nurr1 ⫺/⫺ embryos. Mice were mated during the night
and females checked for vaginal plugs in the morning.
Pregnant females were sacrificed by cervical dislocation
and embryos collected from desired stages. For in situ
hybridization, embryos were rapidly fresh frozen. For
IHC, embryos were fixed 1–24 h in 4% phosphatebuffered paraformaldehyde (PFA) and stored in 30%
sucrose. Genotyping was on tail- and amnion-derived
DNA by PCR. Littermates were used in all comparative
experiments. Cryosections on ProbeOn (Fisher Scientific) and SuperFrost Plus (Menzel-Gläzer) slides were
prepared at 14 –25 ␮m thickness.
Production of Nurr1-Specific Antibody
A GST-fusion protein of the Nurr1 ligand-binding
domain was prepared according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations (Pharmacia). Rabbits were given a
subcutaneous injection of 150 ␮g fusion protein in
Freund’s complete adjuvant (Gibco Life Technologies)
followed by booster injections every 2 weeks. For isolation of Nurr1-specific IgG, the Nurr1–GST fusion protein was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose and
used for affinity purification of Ig from the immune
sera. Nurr1-like IR was not detected in Nurr1 mutant
embryos.
In Situ Hybridization Histochemistry
Slides were incubated with end-labeled oligonucleotide probes at 42°C for 16 –18 h, rinsed, and dipped in
photo-emulsion (NTB2; Kodak) as previously described
(Dagerlind et al., 1992; Zetterström et al., 1996a,b). Exposure was for 6 weeks followed by staining with cresyl
violet and mounting. Oligoprobes to the following sequences were used: Nurr1 (both wildtype and mutant)

Slides were air-dried, washed in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and incubated with blocking solution (3%
bovine serum albumin or 0.1% fetal calf serum, 0.3%
Triton X-100 in PBS or 10 mM Hepes buffer) before
overnight incubation with primary antibody (AHD
2/RaldhI 1:400 (R. Lindahl), ␤-galactosidase 1:000, HB9
1:100, Islet 1 1:1000 (T. Jessell), Nurr1 1:2000, pgp9.5
1:400 (Biogenesis), Ret 1:50 (Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co. Ltd.), TH 1:100, and VAChT 1:1000 (Chemicon International, Inc.) diluted in blocking solution at
4°C. Following rinsing of slides, they were incubated
with secondary antibody at 1:200 dilution (Alexa Fluor
488 and 594 IgG (Molecular Probes) or CY3-conjugated
IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories)) for 1 h.
After rinses in PBS, slides were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector).
X-gal Staining of Embryos
Following dissection, embryos were fixed in 0.2%
glutaraldehyde in PBS and incubated at 37°C overnight
in staining solution (2 mM MgCl 2, 0.02% NP-40, 0.01%
Na-deoxycholate, 5 mM K 4Fe(CN) 6, 5 mM K 3Fe(CN) 6)
with 1 mg/ml X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-␤-dgalactopyranoside). Embryos were postfixed in 4% PFA
and placed in sucrose. Skin was removed to expose
cranial nerve staining.
Acetylcholine Esterase Activity
Sections were immersed in ice-cold 4% PFA for 15
min, washed in PBS, and incubated in staining solution
(38 mM sodium acetate, 0.012% acetic acid, 4.8 mM
sodium citrate, 3 mM copper sulfate, 0.08 mM tetraisopropyl pyrophosphoramide (Sigma), 0.5 mM potassium
ferricyanide, 0.87 mM acetylthiocholine iodide) for 3 h
after which they were rinsed in water, dehydrated, and
mounted.
Microscopical Evaluation and Image Collection
The analyses were performed on multiple embryos
and pups and observations were confirmed by at least
two persons. Structures were identified using published

Ret Dependent on Nurr1 in Dopamine Neurons and Brain

atlases (Altman and Bayer, 1995; Kaufman, 1992; Paxinos et al., 1994; Paxinos and Watson, 1986). For section
analyses, data were evaluated and images were collected using a confocal microscope (Axiovert 100M;
Zeiss) or regular microscopy (Eclipse E1000M; Nikon)
coupled to a digital camera (Spot2; Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). For whole-mount embryos, a dissection
microscope (Nikon SMZ-2B) was used with a digital
camera.
