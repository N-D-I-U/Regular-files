The use of circulating microRNAs as biomarkers has opened new opportunities for diagnosis of cancer because microRNAs exhibit
tumor-specific expression profiles. The aim of this study was the identification of circulating microRNAs in human plasma as
potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. For discovery, TaqMan Low Density Array Human MicroRNA
Cards were used to analyze 377 microRNAs in plasma samples from 21 mesothelioma patients and 21 asbestos-exposed controls.
For verification, individual TaqMan microRNA assays were used for quantitative real-time PCR in plasma samples from 22
mesothelioma patients and 44 asbestos-exposed controls. The circulating miR-132-3p showed different expression levels between
mesothelioma patients and asbestos-exposed controls. For discrimination, sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 61% were calculated.
Circulating miR-132-3p in plasma was not affected by hemolysis and no impact of age or smoking status on miR-132-3p levels could
be observed. For the combination of miR-132-3p with the previously described miR-126, sensitivity of 77% and specificity of 86%
were calculated. The results of this study indicate that miR-132-3p might be a new promising diagnostic biomarker for malignant
mesothelioma. It is indicated that the combination of miR-132-3p with other individual biomarkers improves the biomarker
performance.

1. Introduction
Asbestos-related diseases are a global public health problem.
World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 107,000 deaths
annually worldwide related to asbestosis, lung cancer, and
mesothelioma [1]. The majority of the asbestos-related disease
burden occurs in Europe with more than 71,000 mesothelioma deaths from 1994 to 2012 [2]. In Germany alone, more
than 12,000 deaths were recorded between 2000 and 2010
[3]. Between 2001 and 2050, approximately 65,000 deaths
are calculated for Great Britain [4] and similar trends are
estimated worldwide, for example, 66,000 cases in Japan
until 2050 [5] and 85,000 cases in the USA until 2054 [6].
Thus, asbestos-related diseases, particularly mesothelioma,
still remain a major public health problem in the future.

For the detection of cancer, the analysis of biomarkers in
various body fluids is promising. Biomarkers are economical
and easy to apply and might be simply implemented in
clinical routine in order to detect the disease directly or
guide suspicious cases to advanced cost-intensive diagnostic methods like High-Resolution Computed Tomography
(HRCT). However, proper diagnostic biomarkers need to
comply with several key characteristics [7]. Four important
key characteristics are the following: (i) minimal invasiveness
to measure the biomarkers in easily accessible body fluids,
(ii) robustness against influencing factors, (iii) sufficient
sensitivity to detect individuals with cancer, and (iv) high
specificity to avoid false positive tests in cancer-free subjects.
Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are a well-known class
of biomarkers for several diseases, including cancer. The

2
benefit of miRNAs as biomarkers is based on the deregulation
in diseased cells and the stability in blood [8]. Thus, it has
been suggested that miRNAs are appropriate candidates for
liquid biopsies, avoiding the need for invasive procedures to
obtain tissue biopsies [9]. For mesothelioma, a multitude of
deregulated miRNAs in tissues and cell lines was described
[10‚Äì18], whereas only three blood-based miRNAs, namely,
miR-103a-3p [19], miR-126 [20], and miR-625-3p [21], were
identified as potential biomarkers. However, these results
indicate the general suitability of miRNAs for the diagnosis
of malignant mesothelioma utilizing blood samples.
The aim of the present study was the identification of
circulating miRNAs in human plasma as biomarkers for the
diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, the assessment of the
identified miRNAs with regard to the key characteristics of
proper biomarkers, and the analysis of their performance.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Ethics Statement. All participants of the study provided
written informed consent. The study was designed according
to the rules guarding patient privacy and with the approval
from the ethics committee of the Ruhr-UniversitaÃàt Bochum
(reference number: 3217-08).
2.2. Study Population. Mesothelioma patients were recruited
at the Lungenklinik Heckeshorn, HELIOS Klinikum Emil
von Behring, Berlin, Germany, and in participating medical
practices of the MoMar study. Cancer-free controls were
derived from participants of the MoMar study. The MoMar
study is a prospective study comprising annual medical
examination and peripheral blood collection of more than
2,000 German workers formerly exposed to asbestos in
order to identify and validate molecular biomarkers for the
detection of mesothelioma and lung cancer. As the target
group for the future application of biomarkers to detect
mesothelioma will consist of asbestos-exposed persons, all
subjects in the control group were formerly exposed to
asbestos.
The study group for the initial discovery phase consisted
of 21 male patients with diagnosed mesothelioma, including 14 epithelioid (67%), four biphasic (19%), and three
sarcomatoid (14%) mesotheliomas. Six patients underwent
partial pleurectomy before blood drawing (median: 31 days;
range: 13‚Äì148 days). The matched cancer-free control group
consisted of 21 men formerly exposed to asbestos. Criteria for
matching were age and smoking status.
The study group for the subsequent verification phase
consisted of 22 male mesothelioma patients including 14
epithelioid (64%), two biphasic (9%), and two sarcomatoid
(9%) mesotheliomas. In four cases, the histological subtype
remained unknown. Six patients underwent partial pleurectomy before blood drawing (median: 60 days; range: 24‚Äì179
days). The matched cancer-free control group consisted of 44
men formerly exposed to asbestos. Criteria for matching were
age and smoking status.
Detailed characteristics of the study groups for discovery
and verification are presented in Table 1.

2.3. Blood Collection. Blood collection was performed after
diagnosis of mesothelioma (median: 19 days; range: 0‚Äì731
days). Peripheral blood was collected in 9.0 mL S-Monovette
EDTA gel tubes (Sarstedt, NuÃàmbrecht, Germany). Within
30 minutes after blood collection, samples were centrifuged
at 2,000 √óg for ten minutes at room temperature. After
centrifugation, plasma was separated and frozen immediately
until RNA isolation.
2.4. Detection of miRNAs. For biomarker discovery, RNA
isolation from 1 mL plasma was performed using the mirVana
PARIS Kit (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions, modified by adding
5 ùúáL Carrier RNA MS2 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Profiling of 377 miRNAs was performed utilizing commercial
TaqMan Low Density Array Human MicroRNA Card A v2.0
(TLDA) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions (Life
Technologies). In brief, 3 ùúáL RNA was used as template for
reverse transcription (RT) using the following conditions: 40
cycles of 16‚àò C for 2 minutes, 42‚àò C for 1 minute, and 50‚àò C for 1
second. As template for preamplification, 2.5 ùúáL cDNA was
used, using the following conditions: 95‚àò C for 10 minutes,
55‚àò C for 2 minutes, and 72‚àò C for 2 minutes, followed by 12
cycles of 95‚àò C for 15 seconds and 60‚àò C for 4 minutes. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was carried out using 9 ùúáL
of the diluted preamplification product using the following
conditions: 94.5‚àò C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of
97‚àò C for 30 seconds and 59.7‚àò C for 1 minute. All reactions
were performed utilizing a 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR
System (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs
protocol. Negative controls tested continuously negative.
For biomarker verification, RNA was isolated from
0.5 mL plasma using the mirVana PARIS Kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions, modified
by adding 5 ùúáL Carrier RNA MS2 (Roche). Individual miRNAs were analyzed using commercial TaqMan microRNA
assays (Life Technologies; miR-16 (ID 000391), miR-24 (ID
000402), miR-28-3p (ID 002446), miR-126 (ID 002228), miR132-3p (ID 000457), miR-146b-5p (ID 001097), miR-625-3p
(ID 002432), and U6 snRNA (ID 001973)) according to the
manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. In brief, 5 ùúáL RNA was used as
template for RT and 5 ùúáL cDNA as template for qPCR. RT
is carried out using the following conditions: 16‚àò C for 30
minutes, 42‚àò C for 30 minutes, and 85‚àò C for 5 minutes. PCR
is carried out using the following conditions: 95‚àò C for 10
minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95‚àò C for 15 seconds and
60‚àò C for 1 minute. All reactions were performed in duplicate
utilizing a 7300 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies).
Nontemplate controls were included in all assays and tested
continuously negative.
2.5. Artificial Hemolysis. The dependence of miRNA levels
from hemolysis was analyzed utilizing peripheral blood from
three healthy volunteers. Blood samples were centrifuged
at 2,000 √óg for ten minutes at room temperature. Plasma
and buffy coat layer were separated. Erythrocytes were
resuspended in the 2-fold volume of normal saline (0.9%)
and mixed. The mixture was centrifuged at 2,000 √óg for
five minutes and the supernatant was discarded. Washing

steps were repeated twice. For cell lysis, washed erythrocytes
were mixed with the 2-fold volume of dH2 O and incubated
for 30 minutes at room temperature. Corresponding plasma
samples were spiked with lysed erythrocytes in order to
obtain plasma samples with hemolysis grades of 0%, 0.125%,
0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%.
Amount of free hemoglobin (Hb) in plasma was measured by spectral analysis using a NanoDrop ND-100 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Braunschweig, Germany).
Absorbance was measured at 415 nm (total Hb), 450 nm
(bilirubin), and 700 nm (sample turbidity). Hb concentrations were quantified using the formula Hb (ng/mL) = 154.7
√ó A415 ‚àí 130.7 √ó A450 ‚àí 123.9 √ó A700 [22, 23].
2.6. Data Analyses and Statistical Methods. Normalization
of TLDA results was performed according to Mestdagh et
al. [24] in order to identify proper references suitable for
normalization of single assays in the verification phase. As
the geometric mean (GM) of combined references might be
more reasonable than that of single references [25], the GMs
of the candidate references were additionally calculated and
analyzed. For the identification of the most stable references,
the web-based comprehensive tool RefFinder [26] was used,
including the four typically used algorithms, namely, comparative ŒîCt method [27], BestKeeper [28], NormFinder [29],
and geNorm [25].
Quantitative miRNA expression data were acquired using
the ABI SDS software (Life Technologies). For estimation of
the cycle threshold (Ct), a fixed threshold of 0.2 was used [30].
Ct values > 35 were considered to be under the detection limit
[31]. Thus, for calculation, Ct values > 35 were marked as 35
[32] and miRNA levels were expressed as 2‚àíŒîCt [33].
For evaluation of the influence of the hemolysis grade on
miRNA levels, 2‚àíŒîCt values were used and values > 2.0 were
marked as significantly upregulated [34].
Box plots with median and interquartile range (IQR) were
used to depict the distribution of single biomarkers and their
combinations. Whiskers represent minimum and maximum
values. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were applied to compare the
distributions of the miRNAs between groups and ùëù values

< 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to quantify
classification performance of the biomarkers and the area
under curve (AUC) represents the accuracy of the diagnostic
test. Biomarker cut-offs were determined utilizing maximum
Youden‚Äôs Index (YI) and fixed false positive rates (FPRs).
Classification performance of individual miRNAs and the
combination of two miRNAs were evaluated, investigating
three different algorithms to combine the biomarkers. For
this purpose, and, or, and sequential combinations of the
biomarkers were analyzed. Considering the two biomarkers
ùëã and ùëå, the sets of marker specific cut-offs are ùë•1 , ùë•2 , . . . , ùë•ùëõ
and ùë¶1 , ùë¶2 , . . . , ùë¶ùëõ , respectively. Applying the and algorithm,
the two-marker combination was defined as positive if both
markers were positive (ùëã < ùë•ùëñ and ùëå < ùë¶ùëñ ). Applying
the or algorithm, the combination was defined as positive
if one of the markers was positive (ùëã < ùë•ùëñ or ùëå < ùë¶ùëñ ).
The sequential algorithm is based on sequential screening.
In the first step, all tests measured with the marker ùëã were
considered and defined as positive if ùëã < ùë•ùëñ . In the second
step, negative tests of marker ùëã were classified using the
marker ùëå and defined as positive if ùëå < ùë¶ùëñ . AUCs of miRNA
combinations were calculated utilizing bootstrap analysis
with 500 samples and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were
computed directly from distribution of bootstrap estimates.
For each bootstrap sample, a ROC curve was generated and
AUCs were calculated using the trapezoidal rule.
Potential factors influencing the log-transformed
biomarker level were evaluated using a linear regression
model. Estimates were given as exp(ùõΩ) with 95% CI.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS/STAT and
SAS/IML software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC,
USA).

3. Results
3.1. Candidate References. In order to identify the most
stable reference across the studied groups, RefFinder was
used to rank the 377 miRNAs measured by TLDAs. Using
the four typical algorithms, miR-20b, miR-28-3p, and miR146b-5p were repeatedly identified throughout the study

groups as the top three miRNAs characterized by highest
stability. Comparing the raw Ct values of miR-20b, miR28-3p, and miR-146b-5p and the calculated GMs of all
possible combinations, no significant differences between
mesothelioma patients and asbestos-exposed controls could
be observed (Figure 1). Thus, miR-20b, miR-28-3p, and miR146b-5p and the four combinations (GM of miR-20b/miR28-3p, miR-20b/miR-146b-5p, miR-28-3p/miR-146b-5p, and
miR-20b/miR-28-3p/miR-146b-5p) were in principal feasible
as potential references for subsequent analyses.
3.2. Discovery Phase Utilizing TLDAs. Raw Ct values of
the remaining 374 miRNAs were normalized using the
potential references. ROC analyses were performed to
evaluate the performance of the miRNAs to discriminate
between mesothelioma cases and asbestos-exposed controls.
Biomarkers with more than one false positive test, representing specificity of 95%, were excluded from further
analysis. In total, 40 combinations of miRNAs and references
showing sensitivities between 86% (representing three false
negative tests) and 100% (representing zero false negative
tests) were revealed fulfilling the exclusion criteria (Additional File 1 in Supplementary Material available online at
https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/9280170). Overall, the 40 combinations consisted of 15 different miRNAs (miR-20b, miR24, miR-28-3p, miR-132-3p, miR-140-3p, miR-146b-5p, miR155, miR-191, miR-193a-5p, miR-328, miR-331, miR-381, miR532, miR-628-5p, and miR-660) that were used for further
analysis.
3.3. Influence of Hemolysis on miRNA Levels in Plasma. As
miRNA levels in plasma might be altered by miRNA release
during lysis of erythrocytes, the influence of hemolysis on
the identified miRNAs in plasma was evaluated. Plasma
samples with ascending amounts of spiked-in lysed erythrocytes (0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%) exhibit rising free

hemoglobin levels in comparison to the nonhemolyzed (0%)
samples (Additional File 2). The 15 miRNAs were measured
in plasma samples with different grades of hemolysis. No
significant fold changes > 2.0 could be observed for miR-24,
miR-28-3p, miR-132-3p, and miR-146b-5p at low hemolysis
grades < 0.5% (Figure 2 and Additional File 3). In contrast,
most of the analyzed miRNAs were distinctly influenced by
hemolysis, showing fold changes > 2 already at low hemolysis grades (Additional File 3). Thus, these miRNAs were
excluded from further analyses. Notably, miR-381 seemed
to be not affected by hemolysis, whereas the corresponding
reference miR-20b was highly affected even at low hemolysis
grades. In addition, the detectability of miR-193-5p in plasma
using single assays was not reliable (data not shown). Thus,
these two miRNAs were also excluded from further analysis.
3.4. Verification of TLDA Results Using Individual Assays.
Based on the discovery results and the preanalytical analysis,
four combinations of miRNAs and references were analyzed
in the subsequent verification phase (Table 2). All combinations showed a statistically significant downregulation (ùëù <
0.001) in the initiating TLDA results between mesothelioma
patients and asbestos-exposed controls (Additional File 4).
Analyzing the four combinations using individual assays,
a statistically significant difference (ùëù = 0.002) between
the mesothelioma patients and the control group was confirmed only for miR-132-3p using miR-146b-5p as reference
(Figure 3(c)). Median level of miR-132-3p was 0.08 (IQR:
0.05‚Äì0.10) in mesothelioma patients and 0.11 (IQR: 0.09‚Äì
0.14) in cancer-free controls. In contrast, the other three
combinations showed no significant differences between the
two studied groups (Figures 3(a), 3(b), and 3(d)).
As only two sarcomatoid and two biphasic mesothelioma
were in the study group, no analysis regarding the histological
subtype was performed.
In order to evaluate the performance of miR-132-3p, ROC
analyses were conducted, revealing an AUC of 0.91 (95%
CI = 0.80‚Äì1.00) in the discovery group (Figure 4(a)) and
an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI = 0.63‚Äì0.88) in the verification
group (Figure 4(b)). For the discrimination of mesothelioma
cases from cancer-free subjects, sensitivities and specificities
of miR-132-3p were calculated (Table 3). Utilizing maximum
YI revealed 86% sensitivity and 61% specificity. Using fixed
FPRs of 0%, 5%, and 10% revealed sensitivities of 5%, 23%,
and 36% and specificities of 100%, 95%, and 90%, respectively.
Surgical treatment of mesothelioma, that is, pleurectomy,
might influence biomarkers levels. Thus, six mesothelioma
cases that underwent at least partial pleurectomy were

group.
3.5. Potential Influencing Factors. The impact of two potential
influencing factors on the levels of miR-132-3p was analyzed
in subjects without malignant disease. Neither age nor the
smoking status influenced the miR-132-3p levels in human
plasma (Table 4).
3.6. Combination of Candidate Biomarkers. The two miRNAs
miR-126 (U6 snRNA as reference) and miR-625-3p (miR16 as reference) were previously described as circulating
biomarkers for mesothelioma [20, 21]. In order to improve
the biomarker performance of miR-132-3p (miR-146b-5p as

and asbestos-exposed controls could be observed in contrast
to miR-625-3p (Additional File 5). For miR-126 an AUC of
0.76 (95% CI: 0.64‚Äì0.87) and for miR-625-3p an AUC of
0.58 (95% CI: 0.44‚Äì0.72) were calculated (Additional File
5). Thus, for combination analysis, miR-126 was selected,
whereas miR-625-3p was excluded from further analysis.
In order to ascertain the best combination of miR-132-3p
and miR-126, three different approaches were tested, namely,
sequential algorithm, and algorithm, and or algorithm.
Overall, the miR-132-3p/miR-126 combination improved the

diagnostic performance. The AUCs of miR-132-3p/miR-126
were 0.88 (95% CI = 0.80‚Äì0.95) for the sequential algorithm,
0.84 (95% CI = 0.71‚Äì0.95) for and algorithm, and 0.77
(95% CI = 0.64‚Äì0.89) for or algorithm (Figure 5). For
the discrimination of mesothelioma cases from asbestosexposed subjects, sensitivities and specificities using the
sequential algorithm and and algorithm of miR-132-3p/miR126 were calculated (Tables 5 and 6). Performing bootstrap
analyses of 500 samples indicated a good precision of the

95%. Thus, it was indicated that the and algorithm of miR132-3p/miR-126 might be the best strategy to improve the
diagnostic performance. Utilizing maximum YI revealed 77%
sensitivity and 86% specificity. Using fixed FPRs of 0%, 5%,

Excluding six mesothelioma cases, which underwent at
least partial pleurectomy, from ROC analysis showed no
differences (data not shown).

4. Discussion
Analysis of liquid biopsies is a promising approach in translational cancer research and can be performed in almost all
body fluids [35]. Generally, there is no need for an invasive
procedure to obtain body fluids like blood. Thus, it might
be the preferable choice for diagnostic procedures to detect
cancer at early stages. Screening for the early detection of
cancer might be especially meaningful in at-risk populations.
As the main cause for mesothelioma is the former exposure to
asbestos, the target population for screening of mesothelioma
is people with a former exposure to asbestos. The incidence
of mesothelioma is too low to justify screening in the general
population.
For the diagnosis of cancer, the use of miRNAs as
biomarkers provided new opportunities [36]. For quantitative expression analysis of miRNAs, qPCR is considered
to be the gold standard [37]. In this context, the use of
appropriate references for normalization is an important
issue [38]. The three identified candidate references miR20b, miR-28-3p, and miR-146b-5p showed no statistically
significant differences between asbestos-exposed controls
and mesothelioma patients. However, the raw Ct values

showed a small but consistent increase in the mesothelioma
group in comparison to the control group. This might be
due to the general characteristic of miRNAs to reflect tiny
pathological variations [39]. Additionally, the variations of
the raw Ct values are rather large in the analyzed groups.
This might be due to interindividual differences of the
participants within the groups. Circulating miRNAs are
strongly influenced by several personal characteristics, for
example, age, BMI, and gender [40]. Thus, prior to the use
of miRNAs in screening routine, the miRNAs should be
analyzed in large study groups with detailed information
about personal characteristics to assess potential influencing
factors leading to interindividual differences. In addition,
the feasibility of endogenous references is also influenced
by preanalytical variations, for example, differences in RNA
extraction efficiency and possible PCR inhibitors [41]. Thus,
the addition of an exogenous miRNA like cel-miR-39 might
be very meaningful in order to obtain more reliable results.
In this study, human plasma was used to analyze the
expression of 377 miRNAs in samples of cancer patients
and asbestos-exposed controls in order to identify circulating miRNAs as candidate biomarkers for the detection
of malignant mesothelioma. In patients with diagnosed
mesothelioma, miR-132-3p was significantly downregulated
in comparison to cancer-free subjects. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time to show miR-132-3p as a
biomarker for malignant mesothelioma. Comparable results
were obtained for ovarian cancer, showing significant downregulation of circulating miR-132-3p in serum of cancer
patients [42]. It is common that the same biomarkers can
detect different tumor entities and this might be also true
for mesothelioma and ovarian cancer. Accordingly, it has
been shown that even mesothelin, the most prominent
biomarker for mesothelioma, might be a suitable biomarker

to detect ovarian cancer [43]. Notably, in lung cancer, a
cancer also associated with asbestos exposure; miR-132-3p
was shown to be downregulated as well [44]. Thus, it might
be interesting in future studies to analyze miR-132-3p in lung
cancers, especially with regard to the differential diagnosis of
mesothelioma and adenocarcinomas of the lung.
A trend towards global downregulation of miRNAs is
indicated in several cancers [45, 46] as well as in mesothelioma [11, 20]. For several downregulated miRNAs, a tumor
suppressor function has been suggested, regulating the overexpression of certain proteins in the pathogenesis of malignant mesothelioma [13, 15, 47]. Recently, Lei et al. identified

YAP (Yes-associated protein) as a target of miR-132, showing
that miR-132 alters the expression of YAP at the mRNA and
protein level in hepatocellular carcinomas [48]. YAP is a key
oncoprotein of the Hippo pathway, a downstream cascade of
Merlin, regulating cellular properties linked to carcinogenesis
[49]. Enhanced YAP expression might be a common event
in certain cancers [50], and particularly in mesothelioma
YAP is constitutively active in more than 70% of the primary
tumors [51], promoting cell proliferation [52]. Thus, it might
be reasonable that miR-132-3p also regulates the expression
of YAP in malignant mesothelioma. The elucidation of a possible regulatory function of miR-132-3p could offer additional

12
insights in the pathogenesis of mesothelioma and might
lead to new candidate targets for therapy. Unfortunately, a
possible effect of miR-132-3p on YAP expression could not
be investigated because YAP mRNA was not detectable in the
plasma samples in this study. Therefore, appropriate studies
(preferably in tumor tissues) are needed to follow up on
the possible interaction between miR-132-3p and YAP in
mesothelioma.
Biomarker candidates need to fulfill several key characteristics [7], namely, minimal invasiveness, robustness,
sensitivity, and specificity. It is well known that circulating
miRNAs are easily detectable in serum and plasma [53] and
this is also shown in this study. Thus, miR-132-3p fulfills
the first key feature to be minimally invasive. Regarding the
second feature robustness, the most problematic influencing
factor for circulating miRNAs, which are generally considered to be stable, might be hemolysis. Recently, Kirschner et
al. showed that the grade of hemolysis significantly influences
the levels of miRNAs in plasma and serum [54]. Additionally,
it has been suggested that a multitude of miRNAs published
as candidate biomarkers are rather artifacts of hemolysis than
being influenced by the disease they were supposed to detect
[55]. Hemolysis frequently occurs in clinical routine and
it is indicated that 3.3% of all samples are hemolytic [56].
Generally, high grades of hemolysis show distinct red colored
samples and might not be appropriate for diagnostic analyses.
However, lower grades of hemolysis do not lead to obviously
colored plasma but might still influence the miRNA levels in
the samples. Thus, it is essential to analyze the dependence
of miRNAs from hemolysis prior to the assessment of
the biomarker performance, particularly at low grades of
hemolysis. In order to exclude circulating miRNAs that are
affected by hemolysis, 15 miRNAs identified in the discovery
phase were analyzed with respect to their dependence on
hemolysis. Most miRNAs were clearly affected by hemolysis,
even at low hemolytic levels, and had to be excluded from
further analysis. Accordingly, they are not appropriate for
the use as reliable biomarkers because they do not fulfill the
second key characteristic to be robust. In contrast, the results
indicate that miR-132-3p and the corresponding reference
miR-146b-5p are not affected by low-grade hemolysis and
thus are sufficiently robust.
Regarding the usual influencing factors age and smoking
status, miR-132-3p seems to be relatively independent, further indicating the robustness of the candidate biomarker.
However, the results are based on small numbers. Thus, a
detailed analysis in a large study group of healthy subjects
without malignant diseases should be performed to evaluate
the impact of influencing factors [7].
Surgical treatment of mesothelioma might lead to an
alteration of biomarker levels as shown for mesothelin
[57]. Regarding partial pleurectomy and therefore at least a
substantial reduction in tumor burden, no influence of the
miR-132-3p performance was observable between the study
groups, also implicating that the biomarkers might be robust.
Comparable results were obtained for miR-126 showing that
the marker level did not change after tumor reduction [57].
Regarding the key features sensitivity and specificity, it
is not likely that a single biomarker is sufficient for the

Disease Markers
diagnosis of a disease. Rather, it is expected that only the
combination of individual biomarkers in a marker panel
can achieve sufficient sensitivity at fixed high specificity for
diagnostic purposes. Thus, two already described circulating
miRNAs, namely, miR-126 [20] and miR-625-3p [21], were
additionally analyzed in this study group. Notably, miR126 and miR-625-3p are not affected by hemolysis [55].
Whereas miR-625-3p failed to show a significant difference
in this study, miR-126 discriminated between cancer cases
and controls. For miR-126 alone, sensitivity of 86% and
specificity of 59% (maximum YI) were calculated in this
study, whereas Santarelli et al. calculated 73% sensitivity
and 74% specificity for the discrimination of mesothelioma
patients from asbestos-exposed controls [20].
Accordingly, the combination of miR-132-3p and miR-126
was assessed, showing an improved diagnostic performance.
Despite the slightly higher AUC for the sequential algorithm,
it was indicated that the and algorithm of miR-132-3p/miR126 might be the best strategy to improve the diagnostic
performance due to higher sensitivities at applicable high
specificities of 89% and 95% and the easy implementation of
the and algorithm in clinical routine (the two-marker combination is defined as positive if both markers are positive).
Assigning fixed specificities, sensitivities were enhanced by
the factor 1.8 for the and combination of miR-132-3p/miR126 in comparison to miR-132-3p alone. These results indicate
that the combination of biomarkers within a panel improves
the diagnostic performance. However, using miR-132-3p
and miR-126 within a panel, two different references for
normalization are needed, implicating a less robust method.
Thus, it might be preferable to compile a panel of several
miRNAs as biomarkers with a single reference for normalization. Additionally, biomarkers of different molecular classes
like proteins (e.g., mesothelin [58] and calretinin [59]) or
methylated DNA (e.g., ZIC1 [60] and RASSF1A [61]) could
be tested in combination with the miRNAs and might be
added to a future marker panel in order to further improve
the diagnostic performance.
Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer and
symptoms of mesothelioma commonly occur at late stages
of the disease. Depending on treatment, the median survival
after diagnosis is between nine and 13 months [62]. Thus,
there is a need to detect the cancer at early stages to improve
therapeutic outcome, ideally resulting in a decreased mortality. For the use of proper biomarkers in cancer screening
procedures, high specificity of at least 95% is required to
minimize false positive tests, because they might lead to psychological distress and unnecessary diagnostic interventions
or even therapies. However, for subjects formerly exposed
to asbestos, there is an increased risk to develop asbestosassociated cancers like lung cancer or mesothelioma [63, 64].
Thus, slightly lower specificity might be tolerable for the use
in at-risk collectives.
However, as the study group is relatively small, the
results should be verified in larger study groups, including a
sufficient number of epithelioid as well as biphasic and sarcomatoid mesotheliomas. Additionally, to assess the feasibility
of miR-132-3p and miR-126 to detect the cancer at early stages,
studies with a prospective design are urgently needed [7].

5. Conclusions

References

We identified miR-132-3p as a new candidate biomarker
for malignant mesothelioma, showing significantly different
expression levels between mesothelioma patients and cancerfree controls formerly exposed to asbestos. Thus, the circulating miR-132-3p might be useful for diagnosis of mesothelioma utilizing human plasma samples. Plasma levels of miR132-3p are not altered by hemolysis, the most problematic
influencing factor for circulating miRNAs. Combination of
miR-132-3p with miR-126 improved diagnostic performance,
resulting in enhanced sensitivity and specificity. To evaluate
the use of the miR-132-3p/miR-126 combination for the
detection of malignant mesothelioma at early stages, studies
with a prospective design are urgently needed.
