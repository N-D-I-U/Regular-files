MicroRNAs [1] have emerged as key post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, involved in
various physiological and pathological processes. It was found that several miRNAs are directly
involved in human cancers, including lung, breast, brain, liver, colon cancer and leukemia. In addition, some miRNAs may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in tumor development. Furthermore, a widespread down-regulation of miRNAs is commonly observed in human cancers and
promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis [2–5]. More than 50% of miRNA genes are
located in cancer-associated genomic regions or in fragile sites, frequently ampliﬁed or deleted in
human cancer, suggesting an important role in malignant transformation. A better understanding
of the miRNA regulation and misexpression in cancer may ultimately yield further insight into
the molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis and new therapeutic strategies may arise against cancer. Here, we discuss the occurrence of the deregulated expression of miRNAs in human cancers and
their importance in the tumorigenic process.

1. Introduction
For the past two and a half decades it has been thought that
cancer is caused by genetic and/or epigenetic alterations to oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. Various regulatory factors control the expression of these genes, allowing for the correct
execution of processes such as division, differentiation, and apoptosis. In cancer, however, a deregulation of these genes causes
these processes to become uncontrolled, resulting in tumor formation. Recent research has unraveled molecular mechanisms and
damaged genes involved in cancer. One such example is the discovery of microRNAs [6], that ended up in a escalation in research
on these RNA molecules as key players in cancer biology. Smaller
than protein-coding genes, miRNAs can regulate the translation
of hundreds of genes through sequence-speciﬁc binding to mRNA
[7], and depending on the degree of complementarity will result
in the inhibition of translation and/or enhanced mRNA decay
[7,8]. In mammals, miRNAs are predicted to control the activity
of more than 60% of all protein-coding genes [9] and participate
in the regulation of almost every cellular process investigated to
date (reviewed in References [10–12]).

In 1998, Fire and Mello established dsRNA as the silencing trigger
in Caenorhabditis elegans [13]. The ﬁrst miRNA to be discovered, lin4, was identiﬁed in C. elegans in a screen for genes that are required
for post-embryonic development [14]. The lin-4 locus produces a 22
nucleotide RNA that is partially complementary to sequences in the
30 UTR of its regulatory target, the lin-14 mRNA [15]. Structurally
miRNAs are small non-coding regulatory RNAs ranging in size from
19 to 24 nucleotides (see miRBase, http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/),
that potentially target up to one-third of human coding genes making their role in cellular biology even more apparent [16]. These
small RNAs post-transcriptionally repress gene expression by recognizing complementary target sites most often in the 30 untranslated
region (UTR) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) [17–19]. However,
animal miRNAs may also target 50 UTR and coding regions of mRNAs,
as documented by experiments involving both artiﬁcial and natural
mRNAs and also by bioinformatic predictions [20–22]. MicroRNAs
silence the expression of the target mRNAs, either by mRNA cleavage
or by translation repression. Nevertheless, it has been described that
miRNAs can also increase the expression of a target mRNA [23]. Each
miRNA may target several different mRNAs and, conversely, a single
mRNA can be targeted by several miRNAs. Furthermore, it was
shown that miRNAs can target not only messenger RNA but also
DNA; MiR-373 was found to target promoter sequences and induce
gene expression [24]. More recently it was described that miRNAs
can also target proteins. Eiring et al. reported a novel function of
miRNAs called ‘‘decoy activity”. MiR-328 interacts with a heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein, hnRNP-E2, to regulate RNA-binding protein function [25].

In this review, we brieﬂy describe miRNA biogenesis and regulation of miRNAs at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
Then we focus on miRNAs deregulation in cancers by outlining
their roles as oncogenes or tumor-suppressors, their control of
multiple cancer-related biological pathways and their epigenetic
transcriptional control in human cancers. Finally, we ﬁnish this review with a discussion of the potential application of miRNAs as
biomarkers, diagnosis, and potential therapeutic tools for human
cancers.
2. Biogenesis and maturation of microRNAs
Biogenesis of a miRNA begins with the synthesis by Pol II of a
long transcript known as pri-miRNA (Fig. 1). Also Pol III was initially believed to mediate the transcription of miRNAs because it
produces some of the other shorter non-coding RNAs: tRNAs, 5S
ribosomal RNA and U6 snRNA. Several evidences seem to indicate
that pri-miRNAs with their own promoters must be Pol II products
[26–30]. However, other pathways generate a minor set of miRNAs,
especially from genomic repeats. For example, RNA polymerase III
is responsible for transcription of miRNAs in Alu repeats [31].
The ﬁrst step of miRNA maturation is enzymatic cleavage by the
RNase III Drosha which releases a small hairpin that is termed a
pre-miRNA of 70 nucleotides. The RNase Drosha works together
with its interacting partner DGCR8 (DiGeorge syndrome critical
region gene 8) [32–34]. Drosha belongs to a family of double
stranded RNA speciﬁc ribonucleases. The dsRNA-binding protein
DGCR8 recognizes the stem and the ﬂanking single-stranded RNA
(ssRNA) and serves as a ruler for Drosha to cut the stem releasing
the hairpin pre-miRNA [35]. Interestingly, the DGCR8 gene is one
of the few genes located in a region (chromosome 22) deleted in

a genetic disease termed DiGeorge syndrome [34]. This pri-miRNA
processing complex of Drosha and DGCR8 is called the Microprocessor [33,34]. Pre-miRNAs have a two-nucleotide overhang at
their 30 ends and a 50 phosphate group, which are indicative of their
production by an RNase III [32,36]. All the components of this
microprocessor are needed for pri-miRNA processing in vivo, as a
reduction on the level of either Drosha or DGCR8 by RNAi led to
the reduction of both pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs [33,34]. A
few pre-miRNAs are produced by the nuclear pre-mRNA splicing
pathway instead of through processing by Drosha. These pre-miRNA-like introns, termed mirtons, are spliced out of mRNA precursors. This class of miRNAs bypass Drosha requirement by taking
an alternative biogenesis pathway [37–39].
The nuclear export protein Exportin 5 carries the pre-miRNA to
the cytoplasm bound to Ran, a GTPase that moves RNA and proteins through the nuclear pore [40,41]. Yi et al. (2003) demonstrated that the nuclear export is dependent on the exportin-5
nuclear export factor which is a member of the karyopherin family
of nucleocytoplasmic transport factors. As with other nuclear
transport receptors, XPO5 binds cooperatively to its cargo and
the GTP-bound form of the cofactor Ran in the nucleus, and releases the cargo following the hydrolysis of GTP in the cytoplasm
(Fig. 1) [40,41]. Pre-miRNAs transported to the cytoplasm are subsequently converted to mature duplex miRNA by another RNase III
enzyme, DICER1 [42]. DICER1 is a highly conserved protein with
one homologue in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Dcr),
one in human, one in nematode worm (DCR-1), two in Drosophila
(DCR-1 and DCR-2), and four in Arabidopsis (DCL1, DCL2, DCL3,
DCL4; [43,44]. Dicer cleavage generates a duplex containing two
strands, termed miRNA and miRNA*, corresponding to the two
sides of the base of the stem [45,46]. DICER1 knock-out (Dcr/)

mice and cells are not viable, indicating a major role for this protein during development and normal cell function [47]. In human
cells, the dsRBP that associates with DICER1 is the Trans-activator
RNA (tar)-binding protein, TRBP. This protein is required for RNAi
function mediated by both siRNAs and miRNAs [48–50], where it
acts as a biosensor selecting the dsRNA to be loaded into the RISC
[51,52].
Following DICER1/TRBP cleavage, the resulting 22-nt RNA duplex is loaded onto an Ago protein so as to generate the effector
complex, RISC [48]. One strand of the 22-nt duplex remains in
Ago as a mature miRNA (the guide strand or miRNA), whereas
the other strand (the passenger strand or miRNA*) is degraded.
Nucleotides 2–7 of the mature miRNA sequence create the ‘‘seed
region” [53–56] that primarily speciﬁes the target mRNA that the
miRNA will bind to.
Although it has been recognized and predicted before that
genes can be targeted by multiple miRNAs [57,58], this problem
has not be tackled experimentally. A new study by Wu et al.
(2010) represents the ﬁrst deﬁned example wherein multiple miRNAs target the same gene [59]. In this study, Wu et al. experimentally demonstrate through a high-throughput luciferase reporter
screen that p21Cip1/Waf1 can be directly targeted by nearly 28
microRNAs (miRNAs).

3. Transcription and post-transcriptional regulation
of microRNAs
Transcription is a major point of regulation in miRNA biogenesis. Almost 50% of miRNA genes are located in the introns of protein-coding genes or long non-coding RNAs transcripts, whereas
the remainder are independent transcription units with speciﬁc
core promoter elements and polyadenylation signals reviewed in
[60]. Approximately 50% of mammalian microRNA loci are in close
proximity with other miRNAs. These clustered miRNAs are transcribed as polycistronic messages in single transcript units or are
overlapped in the host transcripts, within exons or introns,
depending on the splicing patterns of the host gene. Numerous
Pol II-associated transcription factors are involved in transcriptional control of miRNA genes. For instance, myogenic transcription factors, such as myogenin and myoblast determination 1
(MYOD1), bind upstream of miR-1 and miR-133 loci and induce
the transcription of these miRNAs during myogenesis [61–63]. Another clear example is the activation of miRNAs transcription by
the tumor suppressor p53. P53 activates the miR-34 family of miRNAs, whereas the oncogenic protein MYC transactivates or represses a number of miRNAs that are involved in the cell cycle
and apoptosis [4,64]. Epigenetic control also contributes to miRNA
gene regulation [65–67].
Drosha processing constitutes another important point of regulation. It was proposed that SMAD proteins activated by BMP/TGFb
interact with Drosha and DDX5 (also known as p68) to stimulate
Drosha processing, although the detailed mechanism for this remains unclear [68]. Drosha processing of pri-miR-18a is dependent
on the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle A1 [69]. The number of these regulatory factors is unknown, but it is plausible that
nuclear RNA-binding proteins inﬂuence miRNA processing through
speciﬁc interactions with a subset of pri-miRNAs.
The let-7 miRNAs also show interesting expression patterns
[70]. The primary transcript of let-7 (pri-let-7) is expressed in both
undifferentiated and differentiated ES cells, whereas mature let-7
is detected only in differentiated cells, indicating that let-7a might
be post-transcriptionally controlled [71]. Similar post-transcriptional inhibition of let-7 also takes place in tumor cells [72]. Recent
studies have shown that an RNA-binding protein, LIN28, is responsible for the suppression of let-7 processing [73–75]. Several differ-

2089

ent mechanisms of LIN28 activation have been proposed: blockage
of Drosha processing [73], interference with DICER1 processing
[75], and terminal uridylation of pre-let-7. Given the cytoplasmic
localization of LIN28, and its strong interaction with pre-let-7
(but not with pri-let-7), LIN28 is likely to function mainly in the
cytoplasm by interfering with pre-let-7 processing and/or by
inducing terminal uridylation of pre-let-7. The U tail that is added
to the 30 end of pre-let-7 blocks DICER1 processing and facilitates
the decay of pre-let-7.
Turnover of miRNAs is a largely unexplored area. RNA decay enzymes might target not only mature miRNAs but also the precursors (pri-miRNAs and pre-miRNAs). Once bound to Ago proteins,
mature miRNAs seem to be more stable than average mRNAs;
the half-life of most miRNAs is greater than 14 h [76].
RNA editing is another possible way of regulating miRNA biogenesis [77,78]. The alteration of adenine to inosines, a reaction
that is mediated by adenine deaminases (ADARs), has been observed in miR-142 and miR-151 [79,80]. Because the modiﬁed
pri-miRNAs or pre-miRNAs become poor substrates of RNase III
proteins, editing of the precursor can interfere with miRNA processing. Editing can also change the target speciﬁcity of the miRNA
if it occurs in miRNA sequences [80].
An increasing number of miRNAs are controlled at the
post-transcriptional level [77]. MiR-138 is speciﬁcally expressed
in neuronal cells, while its expression is suppressed at the DICER1
processing step in non-neuronal cells [81]. Human miR-31,
miR-128 and miR-105, however, might be controlled at the nuclear
export step because the precursors are retained in the nucleus
without producing mature miRNA in certain cell types. Mature
miR-7, miR-143 and miR-145 show reduced expression in cancer
cells compared with normal tissue, although the precursor levels
are similar between the tumor and normal tissues, which suggests
that post-transcriptional deregulation occurs in cancer cells.
Thomson et al. (2006), has described the lack of correlation between pri-miRNA and mature expression in the tumor samples,
while the normal tissue samples had positive correlation. This
demonstrates that the miRNA alterations that occur in tumors
are not due to deregulated transcription but can be, in part, due
to post-transcriptional regulation of miRNAs [72]. This data suggest a multistep model for the control of miRNA expression. Transcription of the pri-miRNA can be regulated, as has been
demonstrated for tissue-speciﬁc miRNAs [61,82–84]. Processing
at the Dicer step can be delayed or inhibited [42,81].
All together, these observations indicate that the miRNAs can be
regulated at various levels, from stability, processing, sequence
identity and binding to target mRNAs. Therefore, these regulatory
pathways are susceptible of being altered in cancer cells.

4. MicroRNA deregulation in cancer
Like transcription factors, miRNAs regulate diverse cellular
pathways and are widely believed to regulate most biological processes. Recent studies have reported the involvement of both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in miRNA deregulation that can
potentially lead to cancer development [85]. Genetic mechanisms
are usually chromosomal abnormalities that can lead to the deletion, ampliﬁcation, or translocation of miRNAs. In addition, approximately 50% of all annotated human miRNA genes are located at
fragile sites or areas of the genome that are associated with cancer
which are prone to breakage and rearrangement in cancer cells
[86–88]. For example, miR-15a and miR-16-1, two tumor-suppressor microRNAs, are severely down-regulated in 70% of patients
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) due to chromosomal
deletions or mutations at the 13q13.4 loci where they are situated
[86].

2090

S.A. Melo, M. Esteller / FEBS Letters 585 (2011) 2087–2099

In addition to genomic and epigenetic alterations [87,89,90],
miRNA deregulation in cancer might be attributable to the impairment of microRNA-processing steps [5,72,91,92], like the described
mutations in the TARBP2 gene that lead to DICER1 destabilization
and therefore to a global down-regulation of miRNAs [5]. In accordance with these results a widespread decrease in mature miRNAs
is often observed in various human malignancies [2,89,93,94].
From these observations a new pathway could be emerging for
colorectal tumorigenesis, in addition to the classical mutator or
chromosomal instable (CIN) categories, standing for a subset of
microsatellite instable colorectal tumors bearing mutations in the
microRNA machinery genes – mutated microRNA machinery phenotype (MMMP). This molecular subgroup of tumors claims to group
up colorectal cancers with MSI and is characterized for exhibiting
concordant tumor-speciﬁc gene mutations in microRNA machinery
genes, in this way deregulating the cells miRNAome. Even though
larger prospective studies will be required to fully characterize and
validate this feature as a classiﬁcatory criterion, the conductive
molecular events have been functionally characterized, and it is
likely that patients suffering from this mutated microRNA machinery phenotype (MMMP) subset of colorectal tumors would beneﬁt
from a broader miRNAome modifying approach.
Transcription factors may induce miRNAs by activating the
transcription of pri-miRNAs. Given the wide impact of transcription factors on fundamental cellular processes, it is not surprising
that many oncogenes or tumor suppressors function as transcription factors. Many miRNA-transcription factor connections have
been discovered in cancer [95]. P53, c-Myc and E2F are further discussed below.
The steady-state level of mature miRNA is determined not only
by the transcription rate of the pri-miRNA but also by the processing
efﬁciency of its precursors and by its stability. MiRNAs often exhibit
a discrepancy in expression of the mature form, relative to that of the
precursor [81,96–100]. Although miRNAs in a genomic cluster are
usually expressed from a common pri-miRNA, the levels of individual miRNAs in the cluster are not necessarily the same [101,102]. A
time-course experiment, after induction of pri-miR-21, revealed delayed kinetics in accumulation of mature miR-21 [103]. Collectively,
these observations indicate that miRNA processing and stability are
important factors that determine miRNA expression level.
The expression levels of DICER1 or Drosha are altered in a number of cancers [3104–107]. Drosha up-regulation is seen in more
than half of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) specimens,
and is likely due to the copy number gain at chromosome 5p,
where the Drosha gene is located [106]. Hierarchical clustering of
miRNA expression data successfully classiﬁed cervical SCC samples
into two groups according to Drosha overexpression. Notably, some
miRNAs were reduced upon Drosha overexpression, indicating that
individual miRNAs respond differently to an overexpression of the
miRNA processing machinery. Interestingly, Drosha was reported
to interact with an oncogenic fusion protein derived from a chromosomal translocation in some leukemias [108]. This interaction
affects pri-miRNA selection of Drosha and, as a result, inﬂuences
miRNA expression patterns. Moreover, frequent hemizygous deletion of DICER1 occurs with a high incidence rate in breast tumors
[109].
Findings from two mouse models strongly suggest that alterations in miRNA expression alone can cause a cell to become neoplastic. The miR-155 developed acute lymphoblastic/high-grade
lymphoma [110], while the knock-out model of the tumor-suppressor cluster miR-15/16 developed chronic lymphocytic leukemia [111].
Recognition of miRNAs that are differentially expressed between tumor tissues and normal tissues may help to identify those
miRNAs that are involved in human cancers and further establish
the key role of miRNAs in the tumorigenic process.

5. Epigenetic control of microRNAs expression
Three main epigenetic events regulate tumor-associated genes:
the aberrant hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, global
DNA hypomethylation and post-translational modiﬁcations of histones [67,112–114]. An extensive analysis of genomic sequences of
microRNA genes has shown that approximately half of them are
associated with CpG islands [115,116]. Therefore these epigenetic
events can also affect miRNA expression. In addition, some miRNAs
are up-regulated (a) upon the exposure of cells to the agent 5-aza20 -deoxycytidine [116], (b) upon mutation of methyltransferases
(DNMTs)[90], or (c) upon histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment
[117]. These studies have identiﬁed some miRNAs that are repressed by CpG island hypermethylation in cancers relative to normal tissue. Representative examples include miR-9-1 in breast
cancer [116] and miR-124a in colorectal tumors [90]. The miR203 locus also frequently undergoes DNA methylation in T-cell
lymphoma but not in normal T lymphocytes [118]. In the case of
miR-124a, hypermethylation is tumor type speciﬁc, as no methylation is seen in neuroblastoma. Moreover, epigenetic silencing of a
miRNA may be a reﬂection of tissue speciﬁcity. For example,
miR-124a is normally highly expressed in neuronal tissues, so its
epigenetic repression in colorectal tumors is not surprising [90].
Saito and colleagues have shown that DNA methylation status
and chromatin structure around miRNA genes differ between bladder cancer cells and normal human ﬁbroblasts [119]. They further
demonstrate that inhibition of DNA methylation and histone
deacetylation induce the expression of miR-127 only in cancer cells
[119]. The methylation of miR-127 and miR-124a genes inﬂuences
the expression of two oncogenic proteins (BCL6 and CDK6, respectively), which are not normally regulated by methylation.
Epigenetic silencing of several miRNAs is a frequent and early
event in breast cancer [116,120], and although the let-7 family is
globally down-regulated in lung cancer [121,122] there is evidence
of let-7a-3 hypomethylation [123]; this is perhaps another example of how miRNAs can have bivalent roles in malignancy.
MiRNAs can also counteract CpG methylation. For example,
miR-29 directly targets DNMT-3A and -3B [124]. In agreement
with this observation, ectopic expression of miR-29 results in a
global reduction of DNA methylation, subsequently leading to a
depression of tumor-suppressor genes that had been silenced by
promoter methylation in cancer cells [124].
In conclusion, epigenetic changes complemented by genetic
inactivation due to mutation or deletion are also a possible mechanism that partially account for miRNA deregulation in cancer
cells.
6. Consequences of aberrant microRNA expression in cancers
If we compare global gene expression proﬁles in cancer and
normal tissues, we ﬁnd that many miRNAs and mRNAs are deregulated. Therefore, it is plausible that tumorigenesis and/or malignant progression results from changes in the entire miRNAome,
rather than from the change of a single miRNA that regulates an
oncogenic (or tumor-suppressive) target gene.
MiRNAs regulate the expression of their targets, so over- or
underexpression of miRNAs is expected to result in down- or up
regulation, respectively, of the protein product of the target
mRNAs. It is not difﬁcult to associate a miRNA with cancer if a direct target of a miRNA is an oncogene or a tumor-suppressor gene.
For example, mir-15 and miR-16 are severely down-regulated in
70% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and induce apoptosis by targeting antiapoptotic gene B cell lymphoma
2 (BCL2) mRNA [125], which is a key player in many types of human cancers including leukemias, lymphomas, and carcinomas
[126]. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that miRNA let-7

S.A. Melo, M. Esteller / FEBS Letters 585 (2011) 2087–2099

may play a critical role in lung cancer development. Takamizawa
et al. (2004) observed that the expression levels of let-7 were frequently reduced in both in vitro and in vivo lung cancer studies; reduced let-7 expression was signiﬁcantly associated with shortened
postoperative survival, independently of disease state [121]. Johnson et al. (2005) also showed that lung tumor tissues display significantly reduced levels of let-7 and signiﬁcantly increased levels of
RAS protein relative to normal lung tissue, suggesting let-7 regulation of RAS as a mechanism for lung oncogenesis. Since the demonstration that let-7 miRNA directly regulates RAS and MYC oncogenes
[127] a number of other miRNA target pairs have been studied.
Breast cancer also presents a deregulated pattern of expression
of miRNAs between normal and neoplastic breast tissues. Iorio
et al. (2005) found miR-125b, miR-145, miR-21 and miR-155 were
signiﬁcantly reduced in breast cancer tissues. Most importantly,
they also observed that expression patterns of miRNAs were correlated with tumor stage, proliferation index, estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and vascular invasion [128]. The
differentiation program epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT) involves changes in a number of miRNAs. Some of these
miRNAs have been shown to control cellular plasticity through
the suppression of EMT-inducers or to inﬂuence cellular phenotype
through the suppression of genes involved in deﬁning the epithelial and mesenchymal cell states. MiR-200 family of miRNAs are
profoundly involved in this process and are deregulated in breast
cancers [129]. Also miR-10b is highly expressed in metastatic
breast cancer cells and positively regulates cell migration and invasion [130].
Colorectal neoplasia is also characterized by alterations in miRNAs expression. MiR-145 and miR-143 are frequently reduced at
the adenomatous and cancer stages of colorectal neoplasia [100].
However, it was also described that the levels of pre-miR-143
and pre-miR-145 are not altered in precancerous and neoplastic
colorectal tissue, suggesting that post-transcriptional control is
the cause for the reduced mature miRNA levels [100].
A reduced expression of miR-26a is observed in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) cells, a miRNA that is normally expressed at high
levels in diverse tissues. Expression of this miRNA in liver cancer
cells in vitro induces cell cycle arrest associated with direct targeting of cyclins D1 and D2. The administration of miR-26a in a mouse
model of HCC results in inhibition of cancer cell proliferation,
induction of tumor-speciﬁc apoptosis, and dramatic protection
from disease progression [131]. In a recent cohort study published
by Ji et al. (2009) tumors had reduced levels of miR-26 expression,
as compared with paired non-cancerous tissues, which indicated
that the level of miR-26 expression was also associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore patients whose tumors had low
miR-26 expression had shorter overall survival but a better response to interferon therapy than did patients whose tumors had
high expression of the microRNA [132].
In human testicular germ cell tumors two miRNAs were reported to be oncogenic, miR-372 and miR-373 [133]. miR-372
and miR-373 inhibit p53-mediated CDK inhibition through direct
inhibition of the Large Tumor Suppressor Homolog 2 (LATS2),
and permitted the proliferation and tumorigenesis of primary human cells which have both oncogenic RAS and active wild-type
p53 [133].
As mentioned before, in several types of lymphomas, including
Burkitt’s lymphoma, the expression of miR-155 is increased
compared to normal cells [134]. Mir-155 is located in the
conserved region of the BIC gene and expression of BIC/miR-155 is
elevated in Hodgkin and Burkitt lymphoma [134]. Furthermore,
miR-155 has been shown experimentally to be a bona ﬁde oncogene,
as is ectopic expression accelerates tumor development [64,135].
Some miRNAs appear to be deregulated in cancers much more
frequently than others. These miRNAs may play key roles during

2091

tumorigenesis. For example, the miR-17-92 cluster is frequently
ampliﬁed in lymphoma and plays a role as an oncogene, possibly
by targeting apoptotic factors activated in response to MYC
overexpression [64,83]. The miR-17-92 cluster was also found
overexpressed in lung cancer, especially in small-cell lung cancer
[136].
7. Aberrant action of microRNAs with no alteration of their
expression levels
The function of protein-coding genes is altered by point mutations, which either transform proto-oncogenes to oncogenes or
abrogate functions of tumor-suppressor genes. In theory, the same
mechanism of activation/inactivation may apply to miRNAs. However, mutation in mature miRNA seed sequence seems to be a rare
event [88,137–139].
In contrast, sequence variation in miRNA target sites may occur
and play a role in cancer. In silico analyses of expressed sequence
tag and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) databases indicate
different allele frequencies of miRNA-binding sites in cancers versus normal tissues [140]. Several experiments have shown that
SNPs in miRNA target sites affect miRNA interaction with its target
mRNA and are implicated in disease [138,141–143]. An interesting
exempliﬁcation of this mechanism is found in let-7 and its target
oncogene, HMGA2 [144,145]. Chromosomal rearrangements at
the HMGA2 locus in several tumors separate the open reading
frame [104] from the 3’UTR that contains let-7 target sites. As a result, HMGA2 escapes from let-7 regulation, is overexpressed, and
promotes tumorigenesis [144].
An alternative splicing event may result in a different 30 UTR
that displays different miRNA recognition sites, as exempliﬁed in
the targeting of Tropomyosin-related kinase C by miR-9, 125a,
and 125b. One mRNA isoform encodes a truncated ORF that is
dominant negative to the intact protein. In this isoform, the 30 UTR
contains the target sites of these miRNAs. In contrast, the target
sites are absent in another isoform encoding the intact ORF; only
the former isoform was repressed by the miRNAs [146]. Although
the stop codon is usually located in the last exon, generation of different 30 UTRs by multiple polyadenylation sites or alternative
splicing has been known to occur in a small but signiﬁcant fraction
of genes [147]. Thus, variation of the 30 UTR and of attended miRNA
target sites is expected to be a mechanism for oncogene activation
or tumor-suppressor inactivation.
Recently, Kedde and colleagues demonstrated that the expression of dead end 1 protein (Dnd1), an evolutionary conserved
RNA-binding protein, counteracts the function of several miRNAs
in human cells and in primordial germ cells of zebraﬁsh by binding
mRNAs and prohibiting miRNAs from associating with their target
sites. These effects of Dnd1 are mediated through uridine-rich regions present in the miRNA-targeted mRNAs [148].
Recently, Steitz and colleagues [23] reported that miRNAs activate the translation of the target mRNA in cells arrested at the G0/
G1 stage. In addition to the aberrant miRNA expression, the switch
from repression to activation should be considered in studying the
role of miRNAs in differentiation and tumorigenesis, as the same
miRNA may exert opposite effects in quiescent cells and proliferating cancer cells in a given tissue.
8. Oncogenic or tumor-suppressive microRNAs
Having in mind their broad effects, miRNAs have been proposed
to function as oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes given their
inhibition of a variety of tumor-suppressive and oncogenic mRNAs,
respectively [85,149]. In particular, three distinct mechanisms
have been proposed. First, oncogenic miRNAs can undergo a gain

2092

S.A. Melo, M. Esteller / FEBS Letters 585 (2011) 2087–2099

of function in tumors due to genomic ampliﬁcations. This has been
clearly demonstrated for the miR-192 cluster, whose ampliﬁcation
in B-cell lymphomas promotes their development [64,150,151]. Furthermore, tumor-suppressive miRNAs could undergo loss of function in tumors due to chromosomal rearrangements, deletions or
mutations. This has been shown for several miRNAs, including the
let-7 family, whose expression can impair tumorigenesis through
inhibition of oncogenes like the RAS family and HMGA2 [152,153].
In particular, let-7 family members are in sites of frequent deletion
in human tumors, and their processing is inhibited by the oncogenic
Lin28 proteins [73,74,154]. Finally, and on the side of the mRNA targets, oncogenes can acquire mutations to remove miRNA-binding
sites in tumors. This has been described for HMGA2, whose translocation promotes lipoma development by releasing the transcript
from let-7-mediated tumor-suppression [145].
There are a number of miRNAs that are overexpressed in one
type of cancer and down-regulated in another. For example, miR205 is up-regulated in lung [122], bladder [155], and pancreatic
cancers [156]. Contrarily, it is signiﬁcantly down-regulated in prostate [157], breast cancers [158] and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [159].
As mentioned before, Eiring et al. has shown that miR-328 can
act as a decoy by binding to a regulatory RNA binding protein
(hnRNP E2) and preventing it from blocking translation of mRNAs.
Thus, miR-328 has a dual role in the regulation of gene expression
[25]. These ﬁndings are intriguing because a miRNA-mediated regulatory function associated with RNA binding proteins has never
been described before.
Therefore, it should it is noteworthy that some miRNAs can
have dual oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles in cancer
depending on the cell type and pattern of gene expression [160].

9. Regulation of cell cycle factors by microRNAs in human
cancer
Cell cycle regulators frequently act as oncogenes or tumor
suppressors. The cell cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1) is one of the best
examples. P27(Kip1) is a tumor suppressor that when mutated
predisposes cells to tumorigenesis upon exposure to carcinogens
[161]. P27(Kip1) binds to Cdk2-cyclin E and prevents G1-to-S transition [162]. P27(Kip1) mRNA transcript is a direct target of miR221 and -222 in glioblastomas [163,164] and prostate cancer cells
[165]. In these types of cancer, p27(Kip1) expression is inversely
correlated with that of miR-221 and -222. MiR-221 and -222 are
overexpressed in other cancers, suggesting that they play a role
in a wide range of tumors [166]. MiRNAs also regulate other cell
cycle proteins including Cdk6, Cdc25A, Ccnd2 (cyclin D2) [167],
Cdk4 [168], a Rb-family protein [101], and p180 subunit of DNA
polymerase a [62]. It has been described perturbation of the cell
cycle by overexpression or inhibition of some miRNAs [3,62,163,
168–171]. Nonetheless, it has not been reported alterations of miRNAs expression during normal cell cycle.
The retinoblastoma (pRB) pathway s one of the major cell cycle
pathways and is altered in almost every human cancer [172]. pRB
is a transcriptionally represses cell cycle transcription factors of the
E2F family resulting in a proliferative arrest. This is relieved by pRB
phosphorylation by the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), complexes formed by a cyclin and a kinase that trigger progression
throughout the different phases of the cell cycle. CDKs are, in addition, negatively regulated by cell cycle inhibitors of the INK4 (such
as p16INK4a) or Cip/Kip families (such as p21Cip1 or p27Kip1) [172].
pRB itself is abnormally down-regulated by the overexpression of
the miR-106a in different human cancers [173]. P130/RBL2, another member of the pRB family, is controlled by the miR-290 cluster, which regulates the expression of DNA methyltransferases in a

p130-dependent manner affecting telomere-length homeostasis
[174]. P130/RBL2 is also targeted by the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster resulting in a clonal expansion required for the proper differentiation of adipocytes [175]. The positive regulators of the cell cycle,
cyclins and CDKs, are also targeted by miRNAs. The protein levels
of cyclin D1/CCND1 and CDK6 are down-regulated by miR-34a
inducing signiﬁcant G1 cell cycle arrest in the A549 cell line
[176]. The miR-34 family of miRNAs are directly induced by p53
and participate in DNA damage response and oncogenic stress induced by this tumor suppressor [177]. miR-34 is also able to promote cell cycle arrest by decreasing CDK4 and Cyclin E/CCNE2
protein levels [168]. CDK6 is also targeted by miR-124 or miR137, two miRNAs silenced by hypermethylation in tumor cells of
different origins [90,178]. Most of these miRNAs function as tumor
suppressors in several malignancies and it is conceivable that they
exert their function through multiple targets. Thus, the let-7 family
may control multiple regulators of cell proliferation such as cyclin
A2, cyclin B1, cyclin E2 and CDK8 among other cell cycle targets
[167]. Some other oncogenic miRNAs may exert their function
through the inhibition of cell cycle inhibitors such as members of
the INK4 or Cip/Kip families. p16INK4a, a CDK4/6 speciﬁc inhibitor,
is controlled by miR-24, a miRNA that is down-regulated during
replicative senescence [179]. p21Cip1, a p53-target of the Cip/Kip
family of cell cycle inhibitors, is a direct target of miR-106b, which
is overexpressed in multiple tumor types and plays a critical role in
cell proliferation by regulating the G1-to-S cell cycle transition
[180]. The p27Kip1 protein, a second member of the Cip/Kip family
with a relevant role as tumor suppressor in human cancer, is
mostly controlled at the post-transcriptional level [163]. miR-221
and miR-222 can function as oncogenes in human tumors by binding to target sites in the 30 UTR of p27Kip1 inhibiting its translation
[163]. The physiological up-regulation of miR-221 and miR-222
coordinates competency for initiation of S phase with growth factor signaling pathways that stimulate cell proliferation [181].
Therefore, disruption of miRNAs expression that target cell cycle proteins, could ultimately lead to the progression of the malignant phenotype in human tumors.

10. MicroRNAs, p53 and programmed cell death
P53, a well known transcription factor, is described as the
guardian of the genome owing to its critical role in regulation of
the cell cycle and apoptosis upon DNA damage. p53 is the most
extensively studied tumor suppressor and its importance is underscored by mutation of p53 in almost 50% of human cancers.
MiRNA proﬁling after p53 induction pointed at miR-34a, -34b
and -34c as the most up-regulated miRNAs [168,169,182,183].
These miRNAs are induced after genotoxic stress in a p53-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo [168,183]. Transcription of primiRNAs -34a, -34b and -34c from both loci is directly activated
by p53. These miRNAs promote cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and
senescence [168,169,182–185]. These effects are explained by the
repression of several direct targets of the miR-34s such as Bcl-2
[185], Cdk4, and Hepatocyte growth factor receptor [168]. In addition
to the miR-34s, other miRNAs may be important in the p53 pathway. MiR-30c, -103, -26a, -107, and -182 were clearly induced, albeit less robustly, upon DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner
[182]. miR-26a expression was also shown to be dependent on
p53 [186]. MiR-504 acts as a negative regulator of human p53
through its direct binding to two sites in the p53 30 untranslated
region [187].
The tumor suppressor protein p53 was also described to modulate miRNA processing through association with p68 and Drosha
[188]. Under conditions of DNA damage, several miRNAs, including
miR-143 and miR-16, are post-transcriptionally up-regulated [188].

S.A. Melo, M. Esteller / FEBS Letters 585 (2011) 2087–2099

Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicate that p53 is present in a
complex with both Drosha and p68, and addition of p53 to in vitro
processing assays could enhance Drosha processing [188]. Interestingly, several p53 mutants that have been previously linked to oncogenic progression suppressed miRNA expression [188]. These
results indicate that the association of p68/Drosha with accessory
factors, such as p53, may be particularly important for the rapid
induction of miRNAs in response to extracellular stimuli.
Apoptosis or programmed cell death is an active process controlled by a gene expression program that varies depending on the
biological context. Because a balance between proliferation and
apoptosis is essential for tissue homeostasis and proper differentiation, deregulation of apoptosis may give rise to cancer. MiRNAs
participate in tumorigenesis by directly targeting antiapoptotic
genes. Representative examples include the repression of antiapoptotic genes Mcl-1 and Bcl2 by miR-29b [97] and by miR-34s [185],
-15a, and -16 [125], respectively. The loss of these miRNAs due to
mutation of p53 or deletion of chromosome 13q14 leads to an increase in the antiapoptotic gene expression and persistence of tumor
cells that would have normally undergone apoptosis. It is very likely
that miRNAs target other genes in the apoptotic pathway, as transfection or expression of a number of miRNAs is associated with
apoptosis [189–191].

11. The role of miRNAs in invasion and metastasis
Features of malignant tumors, distinct from benign tumors, include invasion and metastasis. Malignant tumors are fatal, mostly
due to their capacity to invade neighboring tissues and metastasize
through the bloodstream to distant organs. About 90% of cancer-related deaths are caused by the development of malignant tumors
distant from the primary site lesions as a result of metastasis
[192]. Recent studies have suggested an important role for miRNAs
in metastasis formation. We can classify these miRNAs in two main
categories: metastatic inducers and metastatic suppressors. Metastatic inducers include miR-10b, miR-21, miR-127, miR-199a, miR210, miR-373 and miR-520c. Mir-10b down-regulated in a number
of cancers [128,193], is unexpectedly found to be up-regulated in
about 50% of metastatic breast cancers. Ectopic expression of
miR-10b promotes invasion, intravasation and metastasis in otherwise non-invasive or non-metastatic breast cancer cell lines [130].
Moreover, miR-10b directly targets HOXD10, whose reduction induces the expression of a well-characterized pro-metastatic gene,
RhoC [130]. Further, this miRNAs have the ability to promote
migration, invasion, and metastasis of non-invasive breast cancer
cells in vitro and in vivo [130].
Several miRNAs seem to be metastatic suppressors: let-7 family, miR-100, miR-126, miR-218, miR-335. Reduced levels of miR126 and miR-335 were found in breast cancer characterized by
poor metastatic-free survival [194], while signiﬁcantly decreased
expression of miR-let7c, miR-100 and miR-218 are differentially
expressed between metastatic prostate cancer from high grade
localized prostate cancer [195]. Moreover ectopic expression of
miR-125 impairs cell motility and invasion in a breast cancer cell
line [196], and reduction of global miRNA expression enhances
migration of cells [3].
Interestingly, of the metastatic inducers miRNAs only miR-21 is
a miRNA with established oncogenic properties. MiR-21, one of the
most frequently up-regulated miRNAs in cancer, promotes cell
motility and invasion by directly targeting PTEN (phosphatase and
tensin homolog), a tumor suppressor known to inhibit cell invasion
by blocking the expression of several matrix metalloproteases
[197]. Another pathway was recently reported in colorectal cancers, where miR-21 promotes invasion, intravasation, and metastasis by downregulating Pdcd4 [198]. Alternatively, the majority of

2093

metastatic suppressor miRNAs found to date are also considered
tumor suppressor miRNAs. These observations suggest that either
metastatic inducers miRNAs uniquely regulate key sets of genes involved in invasion and migration, or that these inducers miRNAs
may also have other, yet unknown, tumorigenic properties.
12. The role of microRNAs in angiogenesis
Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels form
through the growth of existing blood vessels, and involves the proliferation, sprouting, and migration of endothelial cells, followed
by pruning and remodeling of the vascular network. Major promoters of angiogenesis include vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (bFGF), which activate
several downstream pathways, including the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphinositide 3-kinase (PI3 K) pathways, to regulate cell motility, proliferation, and survival [199].
MicroRNAs are emerging as important modulators of angiogenesis.
Additionally, dynamic changes in microRNA expression in response to growth factor stimulation [200,201] [202] or hypoxia
[203] imply that microRNAs are an integral component of the
angiogenic program.
The stimulation of neovascularization by c-Myc involves a
down-regulation of antiangiogenic factor Tsp-1. C-Myc represses
Tsp-1 and a related protein, Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)
by activating the miR-17-92 cluster [204]. Tsp-1 and CTGF appear
to be direct targets of miR-19 and -18, respectively. In fact, ectopic
expression of the miR-17-92 cluster is sufﬁcient for promoting
angiogenesis [204]. A recent observation indicates that other miRNAs, miR-378 and -27a, may play a role in angiogenesis [171,205].
Viral miRNAs may also play a role in angiogenesis, as Tsp-1 has
been shown to be a direct target of KSHV miRNAs [206]. Furthermore, miR-126 promotes angiogenesis by repressing spred1 and
pik3r2, which normally inhibit VEGF signaling [207,208].
Thus, targeting the expression of microRNAs may be a novel
therapeutic approach for diseases involving excess or insufﬁcient
vasculature.
13. MicroRNAs as diagnostic tools
Many miRNAs are uniquely and differentially expressed in certain tissues as compared with normal adjacent tissues. These small
RNA molecules can have diagnostic or prognostic value, as miRNA
expression proﬁles reﬂect tumor origin, stage, and other pathological factors. For example, the expression of miRNA let-7 is downregulated in lung cancer but not in other cancers, such as breast
or colon cancer [121,127,209]. MiRNA expression proﬁles indicate
that miRNAs are a better indicator for distinguishing cancer tissues
from normal tissues, and can successfully classify even poorly differentiated tumors [2]. These observations suggest that miRNAs
can be used as biomarkers and diagnostic tools for cancer detection. Moreover miRNAs can function as accurate molecular markers also because they are relatively stable and resistant to RNase
degradation-probably due to their small size [210–212]. They are
highly stable in tissue sections and in blood. Thus their relatively
easy and reproducible detection makes them good candidates for
biomarkers of cancer.
MiRNAs can be isolated and quantiﬁed from formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) specimens. qRT-PCR and microarray data
were reliable and reproducibly obtained from FFPE samples that
had been routinely processed and stored frozen for 10 years. The
data from FFPE samples are consistent with those from frozen samples [213,214]. The development of qRT-PCR methods has improved
the sensitivity of miRNA detection down to a few nanograms of total
RNA. This amount can easily be obtained by ﬁne-needle aspiration

2094

S.A. Melo, M. Esteller / FEBS Letters 585 (2011) 2087–2099

biopsies (FNABs); in fact there has been a report of successful miRNA
measurement by qRT-PCR on FNAB samples [215].
MiRNA markers that could be used for cancer diagnosis are
becoming available. For example, miR-196a is high in pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) but low in normal tissues and
chronic pancreatitis [215]. miR-217 exhibits the opposite expression pattern [215]. Thus, the ratio between miR-196a to miR-217,
calculated by qRT-PCR measurement of the two miRNAs from a
tiny amount of total RNA, indicates whether the samples contains
PDAC [216]. Once reliable indicator miRNAs are chosen, they will
likely yield easy and accurate tools for cancer diagnosis.

14. MicroRNAs as cancer therapeutic tools
For the past two and half decades it has been though that cancer
is caused by genetic and/or epigenetic alterations in protein-coding
oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. These ﬁndings have informed the development of novel (targeted) therapies that are
based on speciﬁc genetic alterations involved in cancer pathogenesis. Nonetheless, with the advent of miRNAs era it was discovered
that a number of miRNAs affect the growth of cancer cells in vitro
and in vivo when overexpressed or inhibited. Because miRNAs
function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, it might be possible
to regulate miRNA expression and/or use artiﬁcial miRNAs to regulate cancer formation.
Overexpression or inhibition of miRNAs can be achieved in several ways. Synthetic miRNA mimics include siRNA-like oligoribonucleotide duplex [217] and chemically modiﬁed oligoribonucleotide
[218]. Conversely, miRNAs can be inhibited by various modiﬁed
antisense oligonucleotides such as 20 -O-methyl antisense oligonuTable 1

cleotide, antagomirs, and so on. As the ﬁrst successful tool for knockdown of a miRNA in vivo, antagomirs (e.g. LNA-modiﬁed antisense
sequences) are of special interest [219]. Antagomirs appear to be
delivered to all tissues (except brain) after tail vein injections into
mice [220].
Synthetic oligonucleotides are effective in vivo for most a couple of weeks, as has been demonstrated by experiments involving
cancer cells engrafted in mice [221] and tail vein injection to mice
[220]. To circumvent this limitation, miRNAs can be stably expressed through transcription of hairpin RNA from plasmid vector.
Recently, artiﬁcial expression of a miRNA target sequence was
shown to inhibit the miRNA function, presumably by titrating
the miRNA away from endogenous targets [222,223]. Thus, it
should be possible to apply such competitive inhibitors for longterm sequestration of a miRNA.
More recently, the Weinberg group has described another
in vivo approach to modulating miRNA function with possible
therapeutic implications. Their approach involved the use of a
sponge vector [1], a vector expressing miRNA target sites design
to saturate and endogenous miRNA and preventing it from regulating their natural targets [224]. In this case, miR-9 was identiﬁed as
a pro-metastatic miRNA in breast cancer [1], and the miRNA
sponge-mediated suppression of miR-9 in the highly metastatic
4T1 mouse mammary tumors cells reduced lung metastasis by
50%, although no effect was observed in the onset of the primary
tumor.
Some chemical compounds alter the expression of a group of
miRNAs [117]; therefore it may be possible to screen for drugs that
could shift the miRNAome in a cancer cell toward that of a normal
tissue. By modulating multiple miRNAs simultaneously, such a
miRNAome modifying approach may be much more effective for

S.A. Melo, M. Esteller / FEBS Letters 585 (2011) 2087–2099

therapy than strategies that aim to regulate a single miRNA. Reconstitution of down-regulated miRNAs offers the theoretical edge of
correcting the malignant defect by inducing small changes in miRNA gene dosage to a homeostatic level achieving substantive
phenotypic alterations that counteract malignant transformation.
Few studies of ﬂuoroquinolones have demonstrated a signiﬁcant
growth inhibition of some tumor cells including translational cell
carcinoma of bladder, colorectal carcinoma and prostate cancer
cells [225–227]. One such drug is enoxacin that belongs to the family of synthetic antibacterial compounds based on a ﬂuoroquinolone skeleton [228]. This small-molecule enhances RNAi induced
by either shRNAs or siRNA duplexes [229].
MiRNAs also affect the drug sensitivity of a cell [197,221].
Expression or inhibition of a miRNA can therefore be combined
with treatment of a drug or other citotoxic therapy. One example
is miR-21 inhibition together with a secreted form of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, which results in a
complete eradication of glioblastoma cells [230].
Collectively, preliminary results suggest that miRNAs could be
useful for cancer therapy. However, there is still a signiﬁcant gap
between basic research on miRNAs and clinical application. Extensive preclinical and translational research is necessary to increase
the efﬁcacy and minimize the side effects of miRNAs-based
therapy.
15. Conclusions
In summary miRNAs play critical roles in the tumorigenic process
and altered miRNA expression is associated with the process of carcinogenesis and culminates in the development of cancer. Examples
of miRNAs involved in human cancer are shown in Table 1.
MiRNAs proﬁles are signiﬁcantly altered in numerous cancers
affecting the cells transcriptome. Nonetheless, these small RNAs
are also subjected to regulation by many cancer-associated proteins such as p53 and c-Myc. Their expression patterns depend
upon tumor origin, histotype, stage and grade. MiRNAs inﬂuence
treatment responses and curability of tumors.
The complexity of the miRNA network and therefore, the possible alterations that they may suffer in the malignant process, is further intensiﬁed by the discovery of miRNA functions that fall
outside their classic range. For example, there is evidence of miRNA-mediated increases in protein translation [23], nuclear import
of miRNAs with distinctive hexanucleotide terminal motifs [76]
and the secretion of miRNAs [231,232]. Furthermore, an alternative
processing pathways has been uncovered in Drosophila melanogaster and C. elegans that bypasses DROSHA and instead uses a splicing
technique to generate miRNA precursors from short intronic sequences (mirtons) [233,234,38]. Most importantly, we should be
aware that miRNAs have also opened the door for the study of
other non-coding RNAs in cancer, such as transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), that are also impaired in human tumors
[235] and many times associated with promoter CpG island methylation silencing [236]. From a traslational standpoint, proﬁles of promoter hypermethylated miRNAs loci have started to show value as
metastasis predictors [237]. In the future, miRNAs, and other noncoding RNAs, may serve as excellent biomarkers for early detection
of tumors, and individual tailoring of therapeutic strategies.
