Posttranscriptional Upregulation
by MicroRNAs
Shobha Vasudevan∗
MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA guide molecules that regulate gene
expression via association with effector complexes and sequence-specific
recognition of target sites on other RNAs; misregulated microRNA expression
and functions are linked to a variety of tumors, developmental disorders, and
immune disease. MicroRNAs have primarily been demonstrated to mediate
posttranscriptional downregulation of expression; translational repression, and
deadenylation-dependent decay of messages through partially complementary
microRNA target sites in mRNA untranslated regions (UTRs). However, an
emerging assortment of studies, discussed in this review, reveal that microRNAs
and their associated protein complexes (microribonucleoproteins or microRNPs)
can additionally function to posttranscriptionally stimulate gene expression by
direct and indirect mechanisms. These reports indicate that microRNA-mediated
effects can be selective, regulated by the RNA sequence context, and associated
with RNP factors and cellular conditions. Like repression, translation upregulation
by microRNAs has been observed to range from fine-tuning effects to significant
alterations in expression. These studies uncover remarkable, new abilities of
microRNAs and associated microRNPs in gene expression control and underscore
the importance of regulation, in cis and trans, in directing appropriate microRNP
responses. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION

M

anipulation of gene expression at the mRNA
level, subsequent to the onset of transcription, enables cells with a means to rapidly or transiently change gene expression profiles in response to
intracellular changes or extracellular cues.1,2 Posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms enhance or reduce
gene expression and include: increased mRNA levels,
relocalization of mRNAs/mRNPs, mRNP modification, and alteration of the translation machinery to
induce or repress the expression of specific mRNAs
under distinct conditions.3,4 In eukaryotes, repression
is more common while posttranscriptional upregulation has been observed in specific cell types such as
developing germ cells and with distinct transcripts,
factors, and conditions. These activation elements are
essentially regulatory elements that retain the ability to repress and activate expression in response
to distinct cues.4–8 The cytoplasmic polyadenylation

element (CPE) exemplifies a regulatory element that
represses translation of specific messages in immature oocytes but activates the same upon maturation
of the oocytes.5,9,10 Importantly, posttranscriptional
mechanisms, in particular, RNA stability and translation control mechanisms can be manipulated by
non-coding RNAs and RNPs to mediate gene expression responses to signaling cues and altered states.

REGULATORY RNAS
Gene expression can be controlled posttranscriptionally by regulatory RNAs in conjunction with associated effector proteins to elicit specific expression
outcomes. Such RNA sequences act in trans as control
non-coding RNAs such as small RNAs in bacteria or
microRNAs. In cis, target microRNA sites or mRNA
regulatory sequences and structures recruit transacting regulatory RNAs and RNPs and can direct
processing, localization, stability, and translation of
the mRNA in response to intra- and extracellular
signals.4–8

Trans-Acting Regulatory RNAs
Small RNAs in Prokaryotes
In bacteria, small RNAs (sRNAs) can alter expression
in either direction.11–13 sRNA regulation of translation often involves the role of RNA-binding proteins,
such as HfQ that enables bacteria to adapt to environmental cues. sRNAs in bacteria act to stimulate
or inhibit translation usually by base pairing to their
targets and by influencing the activities of proteins.
sRNAs employ direct mechanisms, targeting the 5 - or
3 -untranslated region (UTR) to alter RNA processing, translation, or mRNA stability, as well as indirect
mechanisms, preventing the degradation of an activating sRNA or trapping repressive sRNAs to alleviate
repression,14 similar to some of the newly uncovered
functions of microRNAs.

MicroRNAs in Eukaryotes
MicroRNAs are specialized small non-coding 20- to
24-nt RNAs that function as RNA regulators primarily via sequence-specific recognition to guide
associated effector RNP complexes and modulate
posttranscriptional gene expression.15 Their aberrant expression or function is associated with profound clinical consequences including tumorigenesis,
immune, and developmental disorders.16–18 MicroRNAs usually recruit a critical effector protein, Argonaute (AGO or eukaryotic initiation factor 2C,
eIF2C) to form the functional microRNA associated protein complex (microribonucleoprotein or
microRNP). MicroRNAs and thereby microRNPs
recognize target RNAs through a pattern of base
pairing, which can dictate the functional outcome.
Perfect base pairing of the microRNA to its target
can lead to mRNA cleavage and decay,15 while partial base pairing to target sites can lead to mRNA
deadenylation19,20 and translation regulation,3,21–24
primarily mRNA translation silencing or as discussed
in this review, to upregulated expression in response
to specific cellular conditions, sequences, and cofactors. Upregulated posttranscriptional expression can
be mediated directly by distinct microRNPs, and is
then called activation (Figure 1(a)), or indirectly, as
a consequence of regulatory effects on microRNAmediated repression, and then called relief of repression (Figure 1(b)).

CIS-Acting Regulatory RNAs
Target mRNA Specificity
MicroRNAs are predicted bioinformatically to target
over a third of the genome25 but not all predicted
mRNAs are subject to regulation in any given cell and
environment. Many examples demonstrate that UTRs
312

usually are alternatively polyadenylated to include or
preclude essential sites or have additional sequences,
which when occupied in a regulated manner, can
prevent or permit microRNA activity.8,26–28 In muscle differentiation, miR145 upregulated myocardin,
while miR143 and miR145 itself downregulated
other substrates.29 KLF4 mRNA was upregulated by
miR206 in confluent cells and noncancerous cells but
was downregulated by miR206 or miR344 in proliferating cancer cells.30 Therefore, microRNA-mediated
upregulation is target specific, dependent on the specific conditions experienced by distinct target mRNAs.
The presence of additional mRNA UTR sequences
that interfere/synergize with microRNA functions is
expected to dictate the final expression outcome. The
additional UTR factors recruited, are subject to modulation, such as tissue-specific expression of Dead end
1 and thereby miR430 target mRNAs8,27 or cell-cycle
regulation of Pum1’s ability to alter microRNA accessibility to p27 mRNA,31 adding yet another avenue
for regulated expression.

AU-Rich Elements
The AU-rich element (ARE) was discovered as a
decay element.32–34 Additional posttranscriptional
roles, repression and upregulation of translation, were
further ascribed to the ARE.1,35–39 The ARE-/U-rich
binding protein, HuR, and its related family of ELAV
proteins, demonstrated the case as stability factors that
influenced not only RNA processing, export and decay
but also translation repression and activation.39–45
Interestingly, both AREs and microRNPs affect common functions of deadenylation and translation, possibly employing similar mechanisms.46
Several studies demonstrate interconnections
between microRNAs and AREs.46 Several microRNA
targets are predicted (about 75%) or have been
demonstrated to be within AU-rich sequences.47–51
MicroRNPs co-purify ARE-associated proteins; fragile X mental retardation related protein 1 (FXR1iso-a), which associates with tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)α ARE and PAI-RBP1, which associates with
PAI mRNA ARE.52–54 Finally, AREs and their binding
factors have been demonstrated to be associated with
and affect the functions of microRNPs. TNFα mRNA
can be degraded by TTP and miR16, in association
with the microRNP,55 and is translationally activated in quiescent conditions by microRNAs targeting
the ARE.56 HuR can relieve or recruit microRNPmediated repression26,44,45,57–59 while microRNAs
compete with TTP to increase mRNA stability,60,61
suggesting coordinated regulation of mRNA expression by AREs and microRNAs.

Posttranscriptional Upregulation by MicroRNAs

(a)

(b)

FIGURE 1 | Posttranscriptional upregulation by microRNAs/microRNPs. The expression of a reporter bearing the test target site untranslated
region (UTR) (Firefly luciferase with test UTR) is normalized to the expression of a transfection control reporter (Renilla luciferase) to exclude the
effects of transfection efficiency and obtain the test-UTR-specific translation ratio. The ratio is further normalized against their RNA levels to obtain
translation efficiency.20 The reference reporter translation efficiency (first and fourth gray bars of each graph) reads out the translation efficiency in
the absence of the microRNA target site and provides basal translation levels (dashed blue line). Upregulated expression by microRNAs and
microRNPs is observed as direct (activation) or indirect (relief of repression): (a) Activation: In comparison to the basal reference reporter translation
efficiency (dashed blue line marking the translation of the first and fourth gray bars of each graph) as shown by a nontargeted or reference reporter, a
targeted test reporter can be activated (orange bar with the change from basal reference reporter translation shown by the wide black arrow) when
the translation efficiency is greater than that of the reference reporter translation (gray bars, dashed blue line). (b) Relief of repression: The test
reporter translation can be repressed (red bar) where its translation is less than that of the reference reporter translation (gray bars, dashed blue line).
When the regulatory effect of repression is abrogated, translation efficiency is increased (increase depicted by the wide black arrow) from repressed
(red bar) to basal levels (pink bar comparable to the gray bars and dashed blue line depicting the reference reporter translation) because of the
blocked repression. When the regulatory effect of activation (orange bar) is abrogated, the increased translation is lost and brought down to basal
levels from activated levels (brown bar comparable to the gray bars and dashed blue line depicting the reference reporter translation) because of the
blocked activation.

ASSOCIATED FACTORS
eIF2C2
The central factor in microRNA functional outcomes
in mammalian cells is eIF2C2 or AGO2. AGO2 targets
mRNAs that are partially complementary to microRNAs for deadenylation and translational regulation.15
AGO2/eIF2C2 was initially purified as co-eIF2a, a
translation-enhancing activity from rabbit reticulocyte
lysate, which stabilized the ternary complex in the
presence of mRNA at low concentrations and copurified with eIF2 (a critical translation initiation
factor that forms the ternary complex with initiator methionyl tRNA, an important intermediate that
recruits the tRNA to ribosomes).21,62,63 These results
Volume 3, May/June 2012

remain unexplored and the precise functional role of
co-eIF2a or eIF2C2 has not been examined in detail;21
the translation activation observed in recent literature
may reflect this upregulatory activity of eIF2C2.

FXR1-iso-a/dFXR1
Fragile-X mental retardation related protein 1
(FXR1) is similar in protein structure to the FMR1
family of KH domain RNA-binding proteins;64–68
however, the mouse knockout does not show
an FMR1-related phenotype and instead demonstrates muscle loss and neonatal death associated with cytokine deregulation.69,70 FXR1 and
its Drosophila orthologue, dFXR1/dFMR1, were

found to interact with Argonaute in microRNPs
as well as with Argonaute-related family members,
P-element-induced wimpy testis (PIWI), in MIWI/PIWI
and MILI complexes.52,71,72 FXR1 is not required
for downregulation by microRNAs and FXR1-isoa, which activates translation upon overexpression
unlike other FXR1 isoforms and FMR1, is associated
with AGO2.73 FXR1-iso-a was demonstrated to be
required for AGO2/microRNA-mediated translation
activation of specific transcripts in quiescent cells,73
suggesting that FXR1-iso-a association in distinct
conditions contributes to altered gene expression by
the microRNP. Other such factors may also mediate
upregulation.

MICRORNA/MICRORNP-MEDIATED
UPREGULATED EXPRESSION
Translation upregulation by microRNAs has been
observed as a result of two possible outcomes: activation by the direct action of microRNAs/microRNPs
(Figure 1(a)) and relief of repression (Figure 1(b)),
where the action of a repressive microRNA or
microRNP is abrogated. When the relative translation of the test UTR/target site reporter (normalized
to a transfection control) or its translation efficiency20
(further normalized for RNA levels) is greater than the
relative translation or translation efficiency of a reference reporter (mutated at or lacking the key test UTR
site, normalized similarly) expressed from the same
promoter in a parallel experiment, then translation
is activated or upregulated indicating that the tested
site and microRNA stimulate translation, increasing
it over and beyond general translation represented by
the reference reporter (Figure 1(a), orange bar compared to gray bar). Relief of repression is the loss
of repression by the microRNA, where the regulatory effect or reduction of relative translation of the
test reporter below the basal or reference reporter
translation (Figure 1(b), red bar compared to gray
bar) is alleviated,26 leading to the test UTR reporter
demonstrating translation similar to that of the reference reporter (Figure 1(b), red bar compared to the
pink bar, which is similar to the gray bar) and acting like a transcript devoid of microRNA/test UTR
repression effects. It should be noted that translation activation would be greater than the reference
reporter and is therefore distinct from relief of repression (Figures 1(a) and (b), orange bar compared with
the gray bar compared to the pink bar). The translation state when the microRNA is depleted would
define whether the microRNA was inducing activation (in which case there would be a loss of stimulated
expression and translation would be reduced to that
314

of the reference reporter; Figures 1(a) and (b), activation depicted by the orange bar becomes reduced
to that of the brown bar, comparable to the gray
bar) or whether the microRNA/RNP was relieved of
repressive function (in which case there would be no
change as absence of the microRNA would cause the
same effect as relief; Figure 1(b), relief of repression
depicted by the pink bar, comparable to the gray bar).
Biologically, both activation and relief of repression
would result in an increase in the relative levels of the
protein produced.
The discovery of a potential, although yet unexplored, translation stimulation role of eIF2C221,62,63
was further augmented by the elucidation of mRNA
translation activation roles of the related PIWI family
protein, Aubergine, in the Drosophila germline74–76
and of the related PIWI proteins in Drosophila and
mouse germlines.77–80 One of the earliest demonstrations that RNAi and potentially microRNA activity
may be regulated was observed in early oocyte development in Drosophila.75,81 A demonstration of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA upregulation by miR122 at
the RNA level82 was one of the first indications that
microRNAs potentially have silencing independent
functions, while transcription at specific promoter
regions was demonstrated to be upregulated by small
RNAs.83–86 This was followed by studies demonstrating alleviation of microRNP repression of distinct
messages under specific cellular conditions.26,87 Our
study revealed that eIF2C2/AGO2 can activate translation of specific mRNAs in quiescent G0 cells.56,73,88
Subsequent studies summarized below affirmed that
microRNPs have the potential to activate translation directly. Additionally, other studies demonstrate
indirect alleviation of repression.

ACTIVATION BY MICRORNAS
Activation of Specific mRNAs Regulated
by Cellular Conditions: Effect
of Quiescence-Like Conditions
Quiescence (G0) is a unique adaptive response in a
population of dividing cells which enables an advantageous escape from harsh situations that lead to permanent arrest; instead, the cell is suspended reversibly
in an assortment of G0 states where it can develop
and respond adequately to more favorable conditions by returning to the cell cycle.89 Such reversibly
arrested cells are, in contrast to general assumptions,
quite active metabolically, requiring the expression of
very specific genes to maintain the state, resist harsh
stimuli as well as respond to altered conditions.90,91
These are likely achieved by posttranscriptional

FIGURE 2 | Posttranscriptional regulation in quiescent cells (G0 mammalian cells and G0-like immature oocytes). G0 conditions not only
demonstrate selective activation of G0 expressed mRNAs/microRNAs that are required for G0-related functions but also display transcriptional and
posttranscriptional downregulation113 especially of cell-cycle factors and other such undesired genes,89,91 suggesting that other mRNAs, microRNAs,
and regulatory RNA-binding proteins downregulate gene expression of cell-cycle factors88 ; both positive and negative regulation may collectively
enable inhibition of the cell cycle and maintenance of the G0 state.89,91 (a) Translation upregulation of G0-specific mRNAs/ microRNAs. GW182 is an
essential component of the repressive microRNP complex regulated in G0.105–107 In conditions where GW182 interaction with AGO2 is restricted
(oocytes, G0 cells, dAGO2), repression is abrogated.73,108,110–112 Under G0 conditions, FXR1-iso-a (FXR1a) can interact with the microRNP and alter
its function to enable activation of specific, natural target mRNAs and of AGO2 or FXR1-iso-a tethered reporters. Activation of translation in quiescent
conditions is observed with specific mRNAs such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and KLF4 in G0 mammalian cells, and Myt1 in immature Xenopus
laevis oocytes mediated by specific microRNAs, miR369-3p, miR206, and xlmiR16 respectively.30,56,92 (b) Downregulation of cell-cycle mRNAs,
maternal CPE-bearing and other silenced mRNAs. Posttranscriptional downregulation by mechanisms including deadenylation113 is observed with

in Xenopus laevis oocytes.9,10 These mechanisms may be mediated by UTR-RNA-binding regulatory proteins as observed in oocytes9,10 as well as
potentially, by microRNA-dependent mechanisms with or without collaboration with adjoining RNA-binding protein sequences (RNABP site) and
factors.

mechanisms28,89,91 that may include translation
upregulation by microRNAs73,88,92 (Figures 2(a), (b),
and 3(a)).
Translation upregulation by microRNAs was
observed to be transient and appears to be restricted
to specific G0 states and not in G1 arrest or other
states of the cell cycle;30,56,73,88,92 therefore, activation mediated by microRNAs in mammalian cell
lines in G0 is less frequently observed than repression. Quiescence is also influenced by cell-to-cell
contact, where replating proliferating cells at high
density inhibited entry into quiescence and translation activation.89,93,94 In concurrence, Hwang et al.,
demonstrated that increasing cell-to-cell contact via
increased density of replated proliferating cultures
enabled increased repression by microRNAs.95 A

death, G1 arrest or senescence rather than quiescence

in cells lacking quiescence-entry capacity, which, in
the absence of specific tests and markers to distinguish
G0 from G1 arrest and senescence, can misleadingly
suggest G0.89,93,94,96,97

Altered MicroRNP Components
In quiescent G0 cells, the levels of an essential AGO2-associated component of the repressive
microRNP, GW182,98–104 a component of GW bodies, that contributes to microRNA-mediated deadenylation and repression, decreases, is altered in its
interaction with AG0105–108 and is marked by a
decrease in GW bodies,105–107 although the bodies are not essential for repression.109 Failure to
maintain GW182 interaction with AGO2 leads to
a loss of repression108,110,111 and can be associated with activation.112 Activation in G0 could be
mediated by tethering AGO2 or FXR1-iso-a to a
reporter (Figure 2(a)), suggesting that recruitment of

factors. Other specific microRNAs as well as specific factors can activate distinct transcripts with target sites in either the 5 -UTR or the 3 -UTR. 5 -UTR:
Liver specific miR122 stimulates translation of HCV RNA through direct binding to two target sites in the 5 -UTR.134 miR346 interacts with the 5 -UTR
of RIP140 and upregulates translation in mouse brain tissue and p19 cells independent of AGO2.142 3 -UTR: Binding of miR145 to the 3 -UTR of

of the studies on microRNA-mediated translation
upregulation.112,114

KLF4 mRNA and miR206 in Quiescent
and Non-Transformed Cells
miR206 was demonstrated to cause repression of
KLF4 expression in breast cancer cells but not in
normal immortalized MCF10A cells. Interestingly, as
described above in G0 cells, this effect was driven
by the absence of proliferation and by quiescence in
confluent RK3E cells, where miR206 levels increased
and caused upregulated translation in comparison
to cycling cells, where miR344 levels increased
instead and caused repression of KLF4 mRNA and
3 UTR reporters30 (Figures 2(a) and 3(b)). These
studies demonstrate that under quiescent conditions,
specific G0-modified mRNPs/microRNPs are capable
of functioning as translation upregulatory complexes
(Figures 2(a) and 3(a)).

Activation and Downregulation in G0
G0 conditions also display transcriptional and posttranscriptional downregulation113 especially of cellcycle protein factors and other such undesired
genes,89,91 suggesting that other mRNAs, microRNAs,
and regulatory RNA-binding proteins downregulate
gene expression of cell-cycle factors, which would
enable inhibition of the cell cycle and maintenance
of the G0 state (Figure 2(b)). Given the nature of the
targets and microRNAs observed, activation in G0
appears restricted specifically to certain G0 expressed
mRNAs/microRNAs that would be physiologically
required for G0-related functions (Figures 2(a) and
3(a)). These results suggest that microRNAs induced
in specific G0 cellular conditions, miR369-3p in
the case of TNFα mRNA and miR206 in the case
of KLF4 mRNA, may be recruited into distinct,
altered microRNPs that promote activation of specific G0 expressed mRNAs, required for the G0
state (Figures 2(a) and 3(a)), while downregulation
ensues on preexisting cell-cycle-related gene mRNAs
(Figure 2(b)). Given that newly synthesized AGO is
required for microRNP function in trypanosomes115
and that free, unbound AG02 is limiting in the mammalian cell,116 it may be possible that G0 conditions
induce distinct microRNA/mRNA species that would
be bound by new AGO complexes, associated with different cofactors that replace the reduction of GW182
interaction in G056,73,105,107 to mediate these effects
(Figures 2(a) and (b)).

Oocyte MicroRNP Regulation
Proteomic analysis of Dicer depletion in oocytes
revealed limited loss of downregulation,75,81 suggesting that repression by microRNAs may be
Volume 3, May/June 2012

regulated at the early stages of development, emerging in subsequent stages of egg maturation. Recent
studies demonstrated that mouse oocytes lacked
GW182 colocalization with AGO2 and while downregulation of perfect complementary target sites
was maintained, repression by microRNAs was
greatly alleviated108,111,117 although microRNPs are
present.118 These features that are in common with
G0 conditions indicate the potential for selective translation activation.
Translation activation has been well observed in
the developing germline, which are non-proliferating
quiescent-like cells, yet undergo growth in size,
changes, and maintenance,6,7,79,119–123 using regulated
posttranscriptional mechanisms including selective
translation (Figures 2(a), (b) and 3(a)). Unlike mouse
oocytes and human AGO2, the limiting Argonaute in
oocytes of Xenopus laevis is distinct in its behavior and
lacked the usual RNAi-mediated cleavage activity,124
indicating a specialized role. Oocyte immaturity is in
part regulated by the cAMP pathway,125–131 which
also influences quiescence in mammalian cells.93,97
Our study uncovered that in response to cAMP regulation in immature oocytes, AGO recruits xlmiR16
and promotes the expression of Myt1, a specific
mRNA that would need to be expressed to maintain
immaturity92 (Figures 2(a), 3(a)). Consistently, upon
maturation, Myt1 expression is no longer required
and is abrogated and replaced by CPE-regulated
expression of other maternal mRNAs required upon
maturation9,10 (Figure 2(b)).

Specific mRNAs, microRNAs, and Factors
HCV RNA Translation
HCV tropism for the liver was demonstrated to be in
part dependent on miR122, a microRNA abundant
in the liver that enabled increased levels of the HCV
RNA through base pairing at two 5 -UTR miR122
sites.82,132,133 New investigations using monocistronic
reporters bearing the natural UTRs of HCV revealed
that the 5 -UTR miR122 sites also caused translation
upregulation134 (Figure 3(b)). Relocation of the HCV
miR122 target sites from the 5 -UTR to the 3 -UTR
led to repression; however, microRNP/AGO2 tethering at the 5 -end also permits repression in mammalian
cells,135 and activation is observed via 3 -UTR sites
in quiescent cells and in extracts.73,112 This suggests
that collaboration of the miR122 sites with adjoining UTR sequences and/or the overall RNP structure
is conducive to activate expression in the 5 -UTR as
supported by mutational analysis114 but may inadvertently interfere with activation upon relocation
to the 3 -UTR.134 The variable region of the HCV

3 -UTR influenced translation efficiency via the 5 UTR miR122 target sites, suggesting an important
interconnected role between the 5 -UTR and 3 -UTR
to effect translation activation.134,136 Upon miR122
base pairing with the 5 -UTR target site, the HCV
mRNA demonstrated increased association with 40S
subunits, increased 48S complex incorporation and at
later stages, enhanced formation of polysomes134,136
in a mechanism involving AGO2.137 The HCV 3 UTR lacks a poly(A) tail, which appears to be an
important feature common to some of the studies of
translation activation by microRNAs.92,112,114,134,136
Similar to the above studies (Figures 2(a) and 3(a)),
HCV translation by miR122 is also influenced by G0
synchronization of the cells (C. Fehr and M. Niepmann, personal communication), potentially indicating common effects of G0 on the microRNP
complex.

5 -Terminal OligoPyrimidine (TOP) Tract
mRNAs

5 -Terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) tract mRNAs
that often encode ribosomal protein and other
protein-synthesis-related factor mRNAs, harbor a
TOP tract that renders these mRNAs translationally repressed upon arrest at various points in the
cell cycle and upon nutritional deprivation.138,139
miR10a binds such target ribosomal protein mRNAs
immediately downstream of the TOP sequence
at non-canonical microRNA target sites, alleviates
TOP-mediated repression and stimulates translation
in a rapamycin/mTOR sensitive manner during amino
acid starvation, following anisomycin treatment or
overexpression of a mutant activated RAS; treatments
that activate TOP mRNA translation.140 The TOP
sequence appears to be required for the activation
mediated by miR10a.

Drosophila Extract/Drosophila AGO2
(dAGO2)
The nature of the double strand influences whether
the small RNA is recruited to dAGO2 or dAGO1
respectively in Drosophila. dAGO1 is an inefficient
nuclease but can mediate translation repression; in
particular, repression requiring GW182 and mediated
after cap recognition.112,141 dAGO2 functions as an
RNAi nuclease apart from demonstrating cap dependent translation repression with poly(A)+ mRNA in
an oocyte extract translation system but does not
interact with GW182.141 Remarkably, only dAGO2
mediates translation activation of poly(A)- mRNA
in the extract system (Figure 3(b)), suggesting that
this microRNP/mRNP complex required a poly(A)status for translation activation.112 Activation is also
318

observed in quiescent mammalian cells56 and in immature oocytes92 where mRNAs generally have shortened poly(A) tails5,113 and with HCV RNA, where the
mRNA is not polyadenylated and as in the Drosophila
extract system, is internal ribosome entry site (IRES)
driven and lacks a cap.114,134,136

miR346
In brain and p19 cells, miR346 upregulates expression
of a specialized splice variant of RIP140 mRNA via its
5 -UTR. Intriguingly, upregulation was also observed
upon knockdown of AGO2,142 indicating that another
RNP complex or RNA structural alterations by the
microRNA may mediate upregulation (Figure 3(b)).

miR34a/b-5
The neuronal tissue specific, alternatively cleaved
and polyadenylated longer form of β-actin mRNA
harbors a miR34a/b-5 target site that specifically
upregulated translation without increasing mRNA
levels at neuronal synapses143 (Figure 3(b)).

miR223
miR223 increases along with Glut4 expression in type
2 diabetic patient samples of the insulin resistant heart.
miR223 increase in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes,
cardiomyocytes, and cell lines leads to Glut4 mRNA
translation upregulation without altering mRNA
levels, describing another specific microRNA targeting
a clinically important mRNA in cardiomyocytes and
potentially exacerbating the disease state in the insulin
resistant heart.144

miR145
miR145 promotes the quiescent phenotype of smooth
muscle cells and smooth muscle differentiation via
regulated expression of some of its targets including
upregulated expression of myocardin (Figure 3(b)), a
component of the molecular switch for the vascular
smooth muscle development, which bears miR145
target sites in its 3 -UTR.29 Repression was mediated
by other microRNAs in the same cells and miR145
represses other targets, suggesting that the myocardin
3 -UTR, which is sufficient to replicate the same effect
in COS7 cells, bears all the necessary signals to mediate
upregulation.

Increased RNA Levels and Expression
by Competition with Decay Factors
The ARE decay pathway is often interconnected with
microRNA regulation, where microRNA effects are
mediated55,57,73 or abrogated26,59 due to the action
of ARE-binding factors. In turn, microRNAs can

also mediate upregulation indirectly by competing
with or influencing ARE-binding decay factors leading to stabilization by increased mRNA levels60,61
(Figure 3(c)). MicroRNAs stabilize specific target transcripts by preventing association of the ARE decay
factor, TTP: miR466l upregulates IL-10 mRNA levels and miR125b enhances the stability of κB-Ras2
mRNA by preventing TTP binding to the ARE,
thereby preventing degradation by TTP and enhancing
their expression in macrophages60,61 (Figure 3(c)).

MicroRNA-Mediated Decoy of Repressive
Proteins
Unlike traditional relief of repression, where a
microRNA is prevented from associating with
its targets and functioning (Figure 1(b), pink bar
compared to red bar), a distinct microRNA has
recently been demonstrated to also prevent repressive
factors from accessing their targets, thus activating
expression, similar to sRNAs in bacteria. In blast crisis
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML-BC), miR328
levels decrease via the MAPK pathway. Restoration
of miR328 expression rescues differentiation and
impairs survival of leukemic blasts. miR328 was
demonstrated to decoy away a repressive protein,
hnRNP E2 from its target mRNA, C/EBPα, whose
expression was then upregulated in a seed sequence
independent manner145 (Figure 3(d)) and promoted
differentiation. However, the same microRNA
repressed another target mRNA encoding the survival
factor for leukemic blasts, PIM1, further contributing
to differentiation.145,146 These results suggest that
microRNAs can exert dual mechanisms to lead to
a common biological outcome: repressing specific
targets via seed sequence mRNA target recognition
while blocking repressive proteins from functioning
and thereby causing upregulated expression of other
targets (Figure 3(d)).

RELIEF OF REPRESSION
Relief of Repression by Target mRNA
Manipulation
Abrogation of microRNA-controlled translation
repression in mammalian cells can be mediated by several mechanisms by RNA-binding proteins that bind
the mRNA and influence the target site, mRNA localization, or mRNA structure, and thereby microRNA
access or function. Bhattacharyya et al., first reported
that a 3 -UTR U-rich sequence that binds HuR upon
stress, interferes with microRNA repression upstream
mediated by miR122 on the CAT-1 mRNA26 in
response to amino acid starvation and other forms
Volume 3, May/June 2012

of cellular stresses, leading to relocalization of
the mRNA/mRNP from repressive GW/P bodies in
the cytoplasm to polysomes (Figure 4(a)). Similarly,
miR134-mediated repression of Limk1 mRNA in the
dendritic spines is alleviated in response to extracellular stimuli involving the TOR pathway.87,147,148 HuR
can also compete for the microRNA target site negating microRNA repression by competing directly as
in the case of RhoB mRNA and of TOP2A mRNA
where miR19 and miR548c-3p respectively are prevented access to the target site by HuR binding to
the mRNA.58,59 However, these functions of HuR are
regulated and microRNA/mRNA specific149 as HuR
has also been demonstrated to function in concert
with microRNAs to promote repression.57
Another RNA-binding protein, Dead end 1
(DND1), alleviates repression and downregulation
by binding to specific mRNA 3 -UTRs via U-rich
regions, thereby preventing microRNAs from binding
their target sites8,27 (Figure 4(a)). In contrast, the
UTR-binding Pumilio 1 (Pum1,150 binds specific
mRNAs such as p27KIP1 in a cell-cycle regulated
manner and opens an RNA stem loop structure
that obscures a microRNA binding site and thereby
promotes microRNA access and repression of p27
mRNA exclusively in cycling cells but not in arrested
cells.31,151 Pum1 is phosphorylated in cycling cells
to enable its ability to bind RNA while Pum1
RNA binding and overall stability is reduced in
arrested cells. The inability of Pum1 to bind in
arrested cells permits the RNA stem loop structure
of p27 mRNA 3 -UTR to block microRNA access
and thereby cause relief of repression.31,151 DND1
is also regulated: DND1 prevents miR430-mediated
repression of Nanos1 and TDRD7 mRNAs in
primordial germ cells in zebrafish; however, miR430,
in the developing embryo, where DND1 is absent, is
essential for deadenylation and removal of maternal
transcripts. Therefore, alleviation of repression is
further regulated and restricted to specific tissues and
stages of the cell cycle via the regulation of expression
and function of the relieving mediators.

Relief of Repression by Decoy
Relief of Repression by Decoy Non-Coding
RNAs
Pseudogene transcripts and non-coding RNAs with
target site sequences can compete with mRNAs
for microRNA binding and result in alleviation
of microRNA targets.152–154 PTEN, as well as its
pseudogene, PTENP1, are tumor suppressors targeted
by miR19b and miR20a; however, PTENP1 functions
as a tumor suppressor by acting as a decoy for

FIGURE 4 | Relief of repression of gene expression by microRNAs. Examples of microRNAs and specific target mRNAs demonstrating relief of
microRNA-mediated repression. (a) Relief of repression by target mRNA manipulation: influence of RNA-binding proteins on the target site. Specific
UTR-RNA-binding, regulatory proteins, such as HuR and DND1, can bind upstream or downstream of microRNA target sites in a regulated manner
and influence the target site-microRNP interaction, function, or alter the localization of the RNP, leading to alleviation of repression by the
microRNP.26,27 (b) Relief of repression by decoy. Specific non-coding RNAs such as pseudogene transcripts can relieve repression by decoying away
distinct microRNAs via base pairing and functioning as decoy targets while specific factors can relieve repression by functioning as decoy AGO
proteins. Non-coding RNA: Non-coding RNAs such as pseudogene transcripts PTENP1 and KRAS1P (depicted by a blue line base pairing with the
microRNA), which bear similar sites to that found on the target PTEN and KRAS mRNAs are capable of binding and preventing microRNAs, miR19b,
and miR20a from accessing their transcripts.152 Decoy by proteins/AGO10: Decoy proteins such as AGO10 in Arabidopsis is specifically expressed in
shoot apical meristem to decoy miR166/165 away from the repressive AGO1 microRNP, thereby preventing repression of their targets, homeodomain
leucine zipper transcription factor mRNAs, resulting in maintenance of undifferentiated shoot apical meristem.155 (c) Relief of repression by microRNP
modification. The microRNP complex effector protein, AGO, as well as the microRNA may be modified to abrogate repression and thereby, permit
expression. Stress-induced modification of AGO: AGO proteins can be modified by poly-ADP ribose (pADPr) as a stress response to conditions like
amino acid starvation, glucose starvation, and anisomycin, leading to relocalization of AGO2 to the cytoplasm and decreased ability to associate with
target sites and cause cleavage or repression.158 Mutant active LRRK2 in familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease and age-related neuronal
degeneration in Drosophila causes phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (p4EBP1), which associates more strongly with dAGO1 and hAGO2 and abrogates
specific microRNA (let-7 and miR184*)-mediated repression.159 Uridylation of microRNAs: MicroRNAs modified at the 3 -end, especially by
uridylation, can lead to either altered stability of the microRNA or as in the case of miR26a/b, abrogate repression and mediate expression of target
mRNAs such as IL-6 mRNA.180

Posttranscriptional Upregulation by MicroRNAs

Relief of Repression by a Decoy Argonaute
Protein, AGO10
A unique example of relief of repression in Arabidopsis
involves AGO10, a specific Argonaute that recruits
miR166/165 by recognizing the distinctive secondary
structure of its duplex form and decoys it away from
AGO1, a primary microRNA effector of repression
in plants. This enables expression of the microRNA
targets (Figure 4(b)), homeodomain leucine zipper
transcription factors, and thereby maintenance of
undifferentiated cells of the shoot apical meristem.155
These results suggest that specialized AGO proteins
may promote rather than repress expression by
sequestering microRNAs from repression-effecting
microRNPs.

Relief of Repression by MicroRNP
Modification
Relief of Repression by Stress-Induced AGO
Modification by Poly-ADP Ribose
Relief of repression by microRNAs as a stress
response had been observed previously along with
relocalization of target mRNAs from P bodies26 to
the cytoplasm. The formation of stress bodies and
relocalization of AGO from P bodies to a lesser extent
to stress granules was also observed;156,157 however,
quantitatively, most AGO relocated to the cytoplasm
where stress-induced relief of repression was observed
as a result of poly-ADP ribose modifications of
AGO, leading to decreased repression and cleavage
by microRNAs158 (Figure 4(c)).

Relief of Repression by Stress-Induced
Modification of AGO by Pathogenic (Kinase
Active) LRRK2
Gain of function mutations in leucine-rich repeat
kinase 2 (pathogenic LRRK2, associated with familial
and sporadic Parkinson’s disease and age-dependent
degeneration of dopaminergic neurons) in Drosophila
caused loss of specific microRNA repression (let7 and miR184*) because of its association with
dAGO1 and its subsequent association with the
LRRK2 kinase substrate, phosphorylated 4E-BP1.
LRRK2 phosphorylates 4E-BP1 and a dominant
phospho-4E-BP1 mutant was sufficient to associate
strongly with hAGO2 and antagonize repression by
let-7 in human cell lines (Figure 4(c)). LRRK2 also
appears to cause decreased dAGO1 levels in aging fly
brains.159 This modification of microRNP function
and relief of repression is not only tissue- and
stress/aging-specific but also selective for particular
microRNAs/microRNPs, suggesting that individual
microRNAs may associate with distinct microRNP
Volume 3, May/June 2012

complexes.160 Consistently, overexpression of 4E-BP
was demonstrated to be neuroprotective in the
LRRK2 model and its role is important in the
aging brain.161,162 How phospho-4E-BP1 associates
with dAGO1 but not with dAGO2 and alleviates
specific microRNA-mediated repression remains to be
investigated.

Relief of Repression by MicroRNA Uridylation

3 -end modification of microRNAs is now reported to
be widespread due to high throughput sequencing
analyses although the precise roles of these
modifications have not been delineated.163–169
Uridylation has traditionally been associated with
increased instability,165,167,170–177 while adenylation
has been demonstrated to cause increased stabilization
of the microRNA.178,179 Uridylation of specific
microRNAs, miR26a and miR26b, lead to the
alteration of microRNA functions; relieving repression
and promoting expression of a specific cytokine
target mRNA, IL-6180 (Figure 4(c)). How the modified
microRNA leads to a loss of repression and increased
specific expression remains to be further investigated.

MECHANISTIC FEATURES AMONG
EXAMPLES OF MICRORNA-MEDIATED
ACTIVATION
MicroRNAs or siRNAs have been observed to
predominantly cause downregulation, either as
repressed translation, deadenylation, or cleavage of
the mRNA.181 Activation has been observed in a
growing array of studies with specific mRNAs by
distinct microRNAs and in particular cellular conditions, suggesting that activation by microRNAs is a
specialized, regulated pathway. Exploring the molecular similarities and differences of translation activation among distinct cases of activation (Figures 2
and 3) would significantly expand our understanding of the mechanistic features and functions of
microRNPs.

GW182 Interaction and MicroRNP
Modification
An important feature of translation activation appears
to be the reduction of GW182 levels105,107 and its
interaction with AGO2.73,88,108,110–112 AGO2 interaction with GW182 was demonstrated to be essential
for translation repression.98–104 Abrogating GW182
or its interaction with AGO2 leads to a loss or
relief of repression110 or to activation as in the case
of dAGO2 with unadenylated reporters112,141 and
its reduction did not affect activation by HCV as

Advanced Review

significantly as reduction of AGO2,114 suggesting that
the interaction with GW182 is restricted to mediate
translation activation.73,92 GW182 bodies decrease
and GW182 and its interaction with AGO appear
reduced in quiescent-like G0 mammalian cells or
oocytes,105,108,111 where repression is reduced and
translation activation is observed.73,92 In the absence
or alteration of the repressive AGO-GW182 interaction in G0, specific mRNAs may instead recruit a
translation activating complex, such as AGO–FXR1iso-a as in the case of TNFα and in oocytes, which relocalizes to polysomes in G0.56,73,88 Regulation by G0
cAMP/p21-activated kinase (PAK) kinase signals may
give FXR1-iso-a an advantage182 in quiescent cells and
lead to recruitment of the activating AGO–FXR1-isoa complex56,73,88,92 when AGO–GW182 interaction
is altered.105,108,111 Additionally, specific mRNA features such as the lack of a cap or a poly(A) tail as in
the case of HCV RNA114,134,136 and in regulation by
dAGO2,112 may cause preferential recruitment of an
activation complex over the repressive AGO–GW182
by such distinct mRNAs.

mRNA Features-Role of the Cap and
Poly(A) Tail
MicroRNAs also mediate deadenylation of their
messages19,20 and addition of a poly(A) tail in trans
to nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysate extracts enables
microRNA-mediated translation repression in these
lysates,183 while ribosome profiling suggested primarily deadenylation in the case of three microRNAs.184
Deadenylation occurs subsequent to translation inhibition and in other cases, is insufficient to account
for the translation repression effect, which is also
observed on non-polyadenylated transcripts.20,185–187
GW182, a core component of the repressive
complex,98,99,103,104,188 was recently demonstrated
to bind poly(A) binding protein, PABP, and further recruit CAF1-CCR4 deadenylase; these associations were required for microRNA-mediated mRNA
silencing.100–102,185,189–191 In contrast, in several of
the above examples of translation activation, the RNP
complex fails to interact with GW18273,108,112,141 and
lacks a poly(A) tail112 or have short poly(A) tails
due to general poly(A) shortening.113 Additionally,
translation upregulation with the HCV mRNA and
miR122 was primarily observed with its natural 3 UTR that precludes a poly(A) tail on the mRNA and
in the absence of a 5 -cap while addition of a poly(A)
further prevented activation of capped HCV mRNA
reporters.114 Activation by dAGO2 in a Drosophila
extract system required the use of non-polyadenylated
reporters and reporters with a poly(A) tail precluded
322

observation of activation in oocytes.92 These observations suggest that these two features, reduced GW182
interaction and altered PABP/poly(A), represent a
potential, common mechanism that in part transforms
the mRNP/microRNP into a translation activation
complex. These data indicate that the activation of
specific mRNAs may involve distinct interactions with
the translation machinery via altering the role of the
poly(A) tail/PABP that remains to be elucidated.

Specific Interactions with Components
of the Protein Synthesis Machinery
MicroRNAs have been demonstrated to repress
translation by several mechanisms including translation initiation, post-initiation, and nascent peptide
turnover.23,24,192 AGO and PIWI proteins associate
with Murine VASA homolog or MVH, a homolog
of VASA, which functions to activate translation of
specific germ-cell mRNAs through interactions with
the general translation initiation factor, eIF5B,193–197
enabling 60S joining in translation initiation.3,198,199
Repressed microRNP targets were shown to be associated with 40S subunits,200 and Let-7 microRNAmediated functions are affected by eIF3.201 EIF3 is
an essential translation factor that associates with the
40S subunit of the ribosome and enables its association with the ternary complex and with mRNA,
and can stabilize the ternary complex in the presence of the mRNA.198,199,202 Although requiring
further investigation, EIF2C was previously purified
in association with eIF3, isolated as co-eIF-2A and
co-eIF-2C components respectively, of a co-eIF2 complex associated with eIF2.62,63 The closely related
MILI was recently demonstrated to be associated
with eIF3a and stimulates translation.79 It remains
to be investigated whether these associations regulate general ribosome recruitment or indicate a role
for specific translation activation. These interactions
do not exclude effects on subsequent steps in protein synthesis as observed with microRNP-mediated
repression.23,24,192 Finally, many of the examples of
microRNA-mediated upregulation occur with transcripts and cellular conditions that involve specialized
translation features: IRES and a lack of a poly(A)
tail with HCV or dAGO2 in Drosophila extracts,
a 5 TOP sequence and the mTOR pathway, short
poly (A) mRNAs in conditions where general translation is redirected to specific mRNA translation
as in oocytes and G0 cells. These features suggest
that activation involves alternative translation mechanisms that are adapted by the microRNA pathway
for specific mRNAs to elicit precise gene expression
to fulfill the biological requirements of these distinct
conditions.

Posttranscriptional Upregulation by MicroRNAs

CONCLUSION
Posttranscriptional upregulation by microRNPs has
only recently begun to be examined with new revelations about microRNP functions. An emerging
concept from these observations is that microRNAs
may act in concert with particular mRNP complexes

and in response to specific cellular conditions to elicit
distinct gene expression outcomes. A comparison of
their mechanisms and common requirements as well
as an investigation of regulatory switches that mediate
between repression and stimulation will reveal greater
insights into microRNP functions in gene expression
control.
