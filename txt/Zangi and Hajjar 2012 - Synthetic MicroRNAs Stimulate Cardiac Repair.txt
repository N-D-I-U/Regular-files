icroRNAs (miRNA) are short noncoding doublestranded RNAs that were found in several life forms,
such as viruses, plants, animals, and humans. Their main
function is to regulate gene translation by post-transcriptional
binding of the RNA and prevent ribosomal translation (RNA
silencing).1,2 miRNAs are important for the regulation of many
biological processes in our body, including organ development, maintaining stable, and steady-state function of tissues
during adulthood and after injury or disease.1,2 Although several miRNAs were found to be beneficial for cardiac regeneration, miRNAs are currently not in clinical use.3–5 In 2012, Dr.
Mauro Giacca Laboratory showed that human miRNAs can
induce neonatal cardiomyocyte proliferation.6 They identified
40 miRNAs that significantly increased both DNA synthesis
and cytokinesis in neonatal mouse and rat cardiomyocytes.
They then selected two of these miRNAs (hsa-miR-590 and
hsa-miR-199a) and showed their ability to promote adult
cardiomyocytes cell cycle re-entry in vivo. In addition, they
showed that in a mouse myocardial infarction (MI) model,
delivery of adeno-associated vectors (AAV) encoding hsamiR-590 or hsa-miR-199a induced cardiac regeneration with
almost complete recovery of cardiac functional parameters.
Although viral-derived vectors such as AAV could be efficient tools to increase miRNAs expression, they have certain
limitations that can hamper their use in inducing cardiomyocytes proliferation. The long-term expression using AAV vectors may lead to uncontrolled proliferation of the transfected
cells increased cardiomyocytes size and cardiac hypertrophy.
A recent report from the same laboratory, by Lesizza et al7
in Circulation Research, circumvented this problem by using
synthetic miRNAs (single-stranded RNAs) in the heart after
MI. In their work, they focus on the two key candidate miRNAs mimic (hsa-miR-590-3p and hsa-miR-199a-3p) that show
ability to induce cardiomyocytes proliferation and cardiac regeneration when were delivered in AAV9 vector (Figure).6 In
this study, they identify lipid vehicle (RNAiMAX) as the optimal delivery vehicle for delivery of synthetic miRNAs mimic
in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the synthetic
miRNAs mimic shows activity for ≈12 days with most of the
activity disappearing by day 20. In a murine MI model, single
synthetic miRNAs mimic administration (hsa-miR-590-3p or

hsa-miR-199a-3p) in lipid vehicle resulted in improved cardiac function (increase significantly % Ejection Fraction and %
Fractional Shortening) and a significant decrease in scar size
and an increase in cardiac wall thickness 8 weeks post-MI.
This improvement in cardiac function post-MI was also accompanied by significant increase in survival compared with
control miRs (cel-miR-67) post-MI. In addition, Lesizza et al7
were able to confirm that hsa-miR-590-3p or hsa-miR-199a3p increase adult cardiomyocytes proliferation and reduce
apoptosis 12 or 2 days post-MI, respectively.

Lesizza et al7 show that synthetic miRNAs mimic can be
efficiently used in vivo for inducing cardiomyocytes proliferation and regeneration post-MI. The short but sufficient pharmacokinetics (12 days) for induction of cardiac regeneration
indicates similar to modified mRNA (modRNA),8,9 short-term
gene manipulation immediately post-MI may lead to substantial effects on cardiac7 and cardiovascular8 regeneration or
formation of epicardial fat.9 The fact that hsa-miR-590-3p or
hsa-miR-199a-3p induce cardiomyocytes proliferation, and
cardiac regeneration post-MI indicates that the miRNAs other strands (hsa-miR-590-5p or hsa-miR-199a-5p), that were
delivered in the AAV9 vectors, had small or no influence on
the beneficial effects observed by the 2 key candidate miRNA
mimics. Also, the ability to use only on strand and not the
other is beneficial as safety issues can arise from nonspecific
miRNA activity. It will be important to test whether there are
any synergistic effects of combining the 2 candidate miRNAs
mimics in terms of cardiac regeneration. Also, while the authors used acute MI models for both published works,6,7 it will
be interesting to test the effects of the 2 candidate miRNAs
mimics on more chronic MI models once ventricular dysfunction has been established. In addition, as these synthetic
miRNA mimics are commercially available and can easily
be scaled up to be used in larger animal models (eg, sheep
or pigs), it will be clinically relevant to test these synthetic
miRNA mimics on cardiac regeneration in large animal models post-MI.
It will be interesting to test the synergistic effects of combining modified RNAs and synthetic miRNA mimics for induction of cardiac regeneration in vivo. Both platforms are
single-stranded RNAs that have been shown to be successfully
delivered in the same lipid vehicle (RNAiMAX) in vitro and in
vivo. Although synthetic miRNA mimics inhibit mRNA translation and prevent protein formation, modRNA increase mRNA
translation and protein formation. That will allow the research
community to manipulate genes of interest by upregulating
and downregulating them. One main caveat for using synthetic
miRNA mimics, is that unmodified single-stranded mRNA may
elicit an immune response via activation of toll-like receptor

Delivery of synthetic miRNA mimics miR-590-3p or hsa-miR-199a-3p post-MI, similar to delivery of AAV9-miR-590 or AAV9-miR-199a
AAV9 reduces scar size, improves cardiac function and increases survival post-MI. AAV indicates adeno-associated vectors.

their secondary structure and allow them to escape toll-like receptor recognition (such as the case of modRNA). However, because of the short size of synthetic miRNAs mimics (22–23nt),
the secondary structure cannot be manipulated.
In conclusion, this study will positively affect cardiac regenerative medicine by showing the use of synthetic miRNA
mimics miR-590-3p or hsa-miR-199a-3p as potential novel
therapeutic targets for cardiac regeneration after injury. More
work is required to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in cardiac regeneration and to test this strategy in large
animal models before translation into the clinical setting.
