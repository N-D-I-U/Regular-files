Abstract: Objective: The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of intractable epilepsy (IE) are still unclear. This
study aimed to investigate the role of phosphorylation of Cyclase Response Element Binding Protein (p-CREB)/
microRNA-132 (miR-132) signal pathway in the epileptogenesis. Methods: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) was induced in rodents, and the brain tissues were collected. P-CREB expression was detected by Western blot assay and
immunochemistry at 6 h, 24 h, 3 d, 7 d, 14 d, 30 d and 60 d after induced status epilepsy (SE), respectively, and
in patients with TLE. The expression of miR-132 was detected by RT-PCR. Results: The p-CREB and miR-132 were
highly expressed in both rats and patients with TLE as compared to controls. Conclusions: The expression of p-CREB
and miR-132 increases in epilepsy rats and patients, suggesting a possible pathogenetic role of p-CREB and miR132 in TLE via modulating the dendritic plasticity.

Introduction
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), accompanied by
hippocampal sclerosis and mossy ﬁber sprouting (MFS), is a common form of focal epilepsy in
humans [1, 2]. It is characterized by recurrent
spontaneous seizures and associated with
abnormal formation of excitatory circuits,
including dendrites, axons, and synaptic connections [3].
MicroRNAs (miRNA), endogenously highly conserved and noncoding single strand RNAs, are
post-transcriptional gene regulation factors of
about 22 nucleotides [4, 5]. Change in miRNAs
in abundance has been found in patients with
TLE [6], and several of them are involved in the
formation and development of dendrites, axons
and synaptic plasticity [7, 8], and partly regulate the occurrence of spontaneous seizures
[9]. MIR-132, an activity-dependent RNA, was
found to have increased expression in the pyramidal cells and granule cells as the neurons
became mature [10]. With the physiological or
pathophysiological stimuli for sensory neurons,
miR-132 has been addressed in the regulation

of synaptic plasticity via modulating the dendritic growth and spinogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons by targeting p250GAP [1114]. In addition, miR-132 was found to be
involved in the negative regulation of cognitive
memory [15-17] and the decreased miR-132
expression could extenuate the neuronal death
induced by seizures [18], in vivo.
miR-132 is regulated by the CAMP response
element binding protein (CREB), which binds to
the CRE region of a gene, and promote the transcription and translation of the gene when the
site ser133 of CREB is phosphorylated [19].
p-CREB promotes the formation of new synapse and affects physiological function of neurons, such as long-term synaptic potentiation
by regulating protein synthesis [19], and
increasing Na+ conductance and decreasing K+
conductance to increase neural excitation [20].
In addition, CREB is a downstream protein of
ERK1/2 signal pathway which is related to MFS
[19, 21, 22] and that is a common epilepsy
pathophysiology involved in the formation of
abnormal excitatory loops in TLE [23]. Studies
have shown that transgenic mice constitutively

overexpressing the active form of CREB for
more than 3-4 weeks occasionally showed
spontaneous seizures [24], but decreased
expression of CREB suppressed the onset of
epilepsy [25].
Within this context, we hypothesized that the
signal pathway p-CREB/miR-132 2 participated
in the pathophysiological process of TLE. In this
study, the expression of p-CREB and miR-132
was detected in rats and patients with TLE by
immunohistochemistry, western blot assay and
qRT-PCR.

Materials and methods
Human subjects
Thirty patients with intractable TLE were randomly selected from the epilepsy brain tissue
bank. In this study, all of the patients with epilepsy had typical clinical manifestations and
characteristic electroencephalograms. The
diagnosis of seizure type was confirmed according to the 1981 International League Against
Epilepsy. Before surgery, the epileptic lesion
was localized in all patients by brain magnetic

resonance imaging (MRI) or CT and 24-h EEG or
video EEG; sphenoidal electrode monitoring
and intraoperative electrocorticography (ECOG)
were performed to localize the epileptic lesion
before resection in all patients. Two neuropathologists reviewed each case independently.
These patients were refractory to maximal
doses of at least three AEDs, including phenytoin, valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and topiramate. Brain MRI or CT and the
related laboratory inspection had not indicated
other nervous system diseases. Table 1 summarizes the clinical features of epileptic
patients as follows. In this epilepsy group, surgical removal of the epileptogenic zone in the
temporal neocortex was an alternative treatment option. The pathological findings in the
resected tissues included gliosis, neuronal
loss, and signs of neuronal degeneration. After
lesion resection, the electrodes for intraoperative electrocorticography were placed on the
remaining edge of tissues to ensure that the
lesion was resected completely.
For comparison, 15 histologically normal temporal neocortex samples were collected as controls from individuals treated for increased
intracranial pressure due to head trauma. All
patients were histopathologically diagnosed as
brain trauma, and had no prior history of seizures and nor other neurologic disorders. Their
brain structures were nearly normal. The same

two neuropathologists reviewed all these
cases. Table 2 shows the clinical features of
controls.
Our study was approved by the National
Institutes of Health and the ethics committee
on human research at Chongqing Medical
University in accordance with The Code of
Ethics of the World Medical Association
(Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans and EU Directive 2010/63/EU for
animal experiments. Informed consent was
obtained from patients or their relatives.
Rat TLE model
The Lithium-pilocarpine (Li-Pilo) rat model has
been widely used as a model for simulating
human TLE [26]. Adult male Sprague-Dawley
rats (12 weeks old) weighing 180-220 g were
purchased from the Experimental Animal
Center of Chongqing Medical University, China.
Rats were housed under controlled environmental conditions (temperature: 26°C; humidity: 50-60%, 12 h/12 h light-dark cycle) and
given ad libitum accessed to standard food and
water. The experiments on animals were
approved by the Ethical Commission of
Chongqing Medical University and were in
accordance with international standards.
Rats were divided into control group and TLE
group. Rats in TLE group were sacrificed at different time points after status epilepticus (SE):
6 h, 24 h, 72 h, 7 d, 14 d, 30 d, and 60 d (n = 8
per time point). Lithium chloride (127 mg/kg,
i.p., Sigma, USA) and atropina (1 mg/kg, i.p.)
were injected at 20 h and 30 min prior to the
administration of pilocarpine (35 mg/kg, i.p.,
Sigma, USA), respectively. Rats then received
repeated injections of pilocarpine (10 mg/kg,
i.p.) every 10 min until they developed seizures
of stage 4 [27]. In control group, rats were
injected with equal volume of normal saline
instead of pilocarpine. After epileptic seizure of
stage 4 and stage 5 according to the Racine’s
scale [27], rats were maintained in the state of
seizure for 1 h, and then injected with diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and atropina (1 mg/kg,
i.p.) to terminate seizures. Rats exhibiting epileptic seizures of under stage 4 were excluded.
Tissue processing

immediately placed in liquid nitrogen for
Western blot assay and PCR, and the other was
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, and
then embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemistry. Brain tissues in control group were
prepared with the same procedures.
Animal tissues: Rats were sacrificed by decapitation after intraperitoneal administration of
3.5 mg/kg hydrated chloral (1 ml/kg i.p.). Two
slides of hippocampus were dissected, and
then stored in liquid nitrogen for Western blot
assay and RT-PCR. The remaining rats in each
group were anesthetized and perfused with
normal saline followed by 4.0% paraformaldehyde. Brain tissues were immediately fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, embedded in
paraffin and sectioned at 5 μm for immunohistochemistry.
Immunohistochemistry
After paraffinization and dehydration, tissues
were incubated in H2O2 (3%, 20 min) to block
the activity of endogenous peroxide, and then
antigen retrieval was done in a microwave oven
for 4 min at 92-98°C in 10 mmol/L sodium
citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Non-specific binding
was blocked by incubating the sections with
10% goat serum (Zhongshan Golden Bridge
Inc., Beijing, China) at 37°C for 30 min. Then,
sections were incubated with primary p-CREB
antibody (rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:60,
Santa Cruz, USA) for 2 h at 4°C followed by

1300

incubation for 1 h at 37°C, These sections were
treated with anti-rabbit secondary antibody for
25 min at 37°C, and then ABC solution
(Zhongshan Golden Bridge Inc., Beijing, China)
at 37°C for 25 min. Immunoreactivity was visualized with DAB (Zhongshan Golden Bridge,
Inc., Beijing, China). The LEICA DM6000B automatic microscope (Leica, Germany) was used
to collect images. Ten fields were randomly
selected for each sample and analyzed automatically and semi-quantitatively using the
Image-Pro Plus 6.0 image analysis system.
Western blot assay
Total proteins were extracted from the brain tissues using the whole protein extraction kit
(Keygen Biotech, Nanjing, China). Protein concentrations were determined with the Enhanced
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime, Haimen,
China). Proteins (50-100 μg per lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE (5% stacking gel, 60 V, 30
min; 10% separating gel, 100 V, 60 min), and
then were electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes at 250 mA for
60 min. PVDF membranes were incubated at
37°C for 60 min in 5% skim milk to block nonspecific binding, and incubated with primary
p-CREB antibody (rabbit polyclonal antibody,
1:50, Santa Cruz, USA) and primary β-actin
antibody (rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:1000,
Santa Cruz, USA) at 4°C overnight. After washing with Tween-20-Tris-buffered saline (TTBS)
four times (10 min per time), membranes were

incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit
IgG-HRP, 1:4000, Zhongshan Golden Bridge
Inc., Beijing, China) for 60 min at 37°C and
washed with TTBS four times (10 min per time).
The protein bands were visualized with an
enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, USA) and scanned (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
The optical density (OD) of these bands was
quantified using the Quantity One software
(Bio-Rad Laboratories). The mean OD of p-CREB
relative to β-actin was determined.
RNA isolation and reverse transcription
Total RNA was extracted from the brain tissues
using RNAiso plus (TaKaRa, Dalian, China)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The concentration and purity of RNA were measured at 260 (A260) and 280 (A280) nm. The RNA
samples were used for reverse transcription
(RT) reaction when the A260/A280 was between
1.90 and 2.20. Then, 1 μg of total RNA was
added into 10 μl of RT system using the SYBR®
PrimeScript™ miRNA RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa,
Dalian, China). The RT reaction was done under
the following conditions: (1) 37°C for 60 min;
(2) 85°C for 5 s. For each RT reaction, a blank
control was prepared using all the reagents,
but the RNA was replaced with an equivalent
volume of water. Each reaction mixture was
diluted to 100 μl for real-time PCR.
SYBR-Green quantitative real-time PCR
Real-Time PCR was done on BIO-RED CFX96.
SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ II (TaKaRa, Dalian,
China), Uni-miR qPCR Primer (TaKaRa, Dalian,
China) and miR-132 specific primer (F
5’-GCCGCTAACAGTCTACAGCCAT-3’) (Genscript,
China) were used. The PCR mixture contained
10 μl of SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ II, 0.5 μl of 10
μM Uni-miR qPCR Primer, 0.5 μl of miR-132
specific primer, 1 μl of RT reactionsolution and
8 μl of dH2O. The real-time PCR was done under
the following conditions: stage 1, 95°C for 30 s;
stage 2, a total of 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and
60°C for 20 s; stage 3, dissociation. Standard
curves of miR-132 and β-actin were delineated
to assure the efficiencies of amplification
between 90% and 110%. After PCR, the amplification and melting curves were checked, and
data were analyzed with the software (Bio-Rad
CFX Manager) and represented as mean 2-ΔΔCT
± standard deviation (SD). Beta-actin (primer F

1301

5’-AGGCCCCTCTGAACCCTAAG-3’) was used for
normalization.
Data analysis
Data are expressed as means ± SD. Student’s
t-test (SPSS 17) was used for statistical analysis of differences between epileptic group and
control group in humans.
Differences among animal groups were compared by one-way ANOVA followed by turkey’s
HSD post hoc multiple comparison test (GraphPad Prism 5). A value of P less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of
patients
The mean age of patents with drug-refractory
TLE was 35.10 ± 17.67 years and there were
21 men and 9 women. In addition, 50% of
patients had at least a 10-year history of seizure, and 33.3% had a clinical history of more
than 15 years. In control group, patients had a
mean age of 30.06 ± 12.49 years, and there
were 9 men and 6 women. There were no significant differences in age and gender between
IE group and control group (P > 0.05).
Independent samples test and Chi-square test
were used for comparisons.
MiR-132 expression in the hippocampus of
TLE rats in different phases of epilepsy
MiR-132 expression at different times after SE
was detected by real-time PCR (Figure 1A).
Beta-actin was used for normalization. In TLE
rats, the miR-132 expression (n = 3 per group)
was significantly up-regulated at 24 h (2.25 ±
0.10, P < 0.05) and 7 d (1.80 ± 0.11, P < 0.05)
after SE. Although the miR-132 expression upregulated at 3 d (1.28 ± 0.13, P > 0.05), 14 d
(1.07 ± 0.11, P > 0.05), 30 d (1.12 ± 0.10, P >
0.05) and 60 d (1.32 ± 0.08, P > 0.05) after SE,
no significance was observed as compared to
control group.

lower in the TLE patients (0.32 ± 0.34, P <

expression was not in strict accordance with
the p-CREB expression in rat model.
P-CREB expression by Western blot assay
P-CREB expression was detected in the hippocampus of TLE rats and the temporal neocortex
of TLE patients by Western blot assay (Figure
2A and 2B). Molecular weight of p-CREB and
β-actin were both 43 kDa. In TLE rats (n = 5 per
group), the p-CREB expression was up-regulated at 6 h after SE but no significance was
observed, and the p-CREB expression continued to increase, and significant difference was
observed at 24 h (0.63 ± 0.07), 3 d (0.83 ±
0.20) and 7 d (0.71 ± 0.31) after SE as compared to control group (0.29 ± 0.03; P < 0.5).
When the rats were in the latency phase of TLE,
there was a slight decline in the p-CREB expression when compared with that in the acute
phase, and with the control group (P > 0.05). In
patients with drug-refractory TLE, the p-CREB
expression was up-regulated significantly (0.42
± 0.20; P < 0.05) when compared with control
group (0.26 ± 0.10; Figure 2C and 2D).

p-CREB expression by immunohistochemistry
The p-CREB expression was detected in TLE
rats and TLE patients by immunohistochemistry (Figure 3). Results showed p-CREB was
expressed in the nucleus of neurons in the subfields of hippocampus (dentate gyrus, CA1 and
CA3 region) (Figure 3A and 3B). p-CREB expression was up-regulated at all time points after
SE (P < 0.05). In patients with drug-refractory
TLE, the p-CREB expression increased markedly (0.42 ± 0.06; P < 0.05) when compared
with control group (0.23 ± 0.02; Figure 3C and
3D).
Discussion
MFS is a characteristic pathophysiology in
patients with the drug-refractory TLE, and
increased dendritic thickness and length
accompanied by an increase in the number of
dendritic spines are associated with the afferent sprouting [28-30]. miR-132, which is CREBdependent, has been revealed to regulate the
dendritic structural plasticity (dendritic length,
volume and the number of spines in vitro) [11,
13, 14]. Whether the p-CREB/miR-132 signal
pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of TLE

Int J Clin Exp Med 2014;7(5):1297-1306

p-CREB and miR-132 in epilepsy
is still unclear. In the present study, rat Li-Pilo
model was established to simulate human TLE,
and the expression of p-CREB and miR-132
was detected in TLE patients and TLE rats.
Immunohistochemistry showed p-CREB was
highly expressed in rats at all time points after
SE and in TLE patients. The p-CREB positive
staining was located in the neuronal nucleus of
hippocampus (such as pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells); there was no positive staining in the microglial cells and astrocytes (Figure
4). Western blot assay indicated p-CREB
expression was up-regulated at 6 h after SE but
there was no significance. The p-CREB expression continued to increased at 24 h, 3 d and 7
d after SE (P < 0.05) when compared with control group. However, there was a slight decline
in the latency phase of SE as compared to that
in the acute phase and that in control group.
When compared with findings in immunohistochemistry, the up-regulated expression was
comparable between hyperacute phase and
latent phase in Western blot assay. That may
be explained as follows: a. the sample size was
too small to draw the conclusion (n = 5 per
group for western blot assay); b. immunohistochemistry was more accessible to get the significant difference as its advantages in analysis, and we only collected 3 brain tissues for
this detection; c. the whole hippocampus was
used for Western blot assay, and findings were
influenced by the compositions of total protein.
It has been addressed that the neuronal loss,
microglia and astroglia cell proliferation significantly occur in the latent and chronic phases
[31, 32]. Considering the above context, they
were not conflicting between results acquired
by two measurements. As a result, the p-CREB
expression was significantly up-regulated in the
neurons of SLE rats and TLE patients.
The expression of miR-132, an activity-dependent RNA, was increased in pyramidal cells and
granule cells as the neurons became mature.
RT-PCR was done to detect the expression of
miR-132. Results showed the miR-132 was upregulated at 24 h and 7 d after SE in TLE rats
with significant difference, but no marked difference was observed at other time points as
compared to control group. This may be
explained as that the sample size was small (3
hippocampus tissues per group were used for
RT-PCR). There was a decline in miR-132
expression at 3 d after SE when compared with
1304

that at 24 h. It mainly attributed to the high
expression of inducible cAMP early repressor
(ICER) which may down-regulate the CREB
expression, and ICER expression may be regulated by the overexpression of CREB consequently in the acute phase [33-36]. When the
negative feedback trended to be static, miR132 was highly expressed again though there
was slight to medium neural loss at this time
point. In the latent phase, there was no significant increase in miR-132 expression when
compared with controls, because the massive
neuronal loss and microglia and astroglia cell
proliferation were present at this time point,
and MFS pathogenesis occurred meanwhile
[31, 32]. If it was taken into account, the conclusion could be drawn that miR-132 expression in the neurons was also up-regulated in
the latent phase, or it was down-regulated by
another signal molecules. We also measured
the miR-132 expression in TLE patients. There
was a significant decrease in miR-132 expression when compared with controls. This may be
attributed to the massive neuronal loss, and
microglia and astroglia cell proliferation due to
long-term influence of epilepsy (Table 1).
However, a previous genome-wide expression
analysis of miRNAs in controls as compared to
epileptic subjects did not identify the association between miR-132 with refractory TLE [37].
This might be attributed to the differences in
the source of samples, causes and abundance
of samples.
In conclusion, the expression of p-CREB and
miR-132 is highly up-regulated in the neurons
of TLE rats and patients with drug-refractory
TLE when compared with controls. Our findings
demonstrate that the p-CREB/miR-132 signal
pathway participates in the epileptogenesis.
Further studies are still needed to validate the
role of this signal pathway in the epileptogenesis.
