ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION

The orphan nuclear receptor nurr1 (NR4A2) is an
essential transcription factor for the acquisition
and maintenance of the phenotype of dopamine
(DA)-synthesizing neurons in the mesencephalon.
Although structurally related to ligand-regulated
nuclear receptors, nurr1 is functionally atypical
due to its inability to bind a cognate ligand and to
activate transcription following canonical nuclear
receptor (NR) rules. Importantly, the physiological
stimuli that activate this NR and the signaling
proteins that regulate its transcriptional activity in
mesencephalic neurons are unknown. We used an
affinity chromatography approach and CSM14.1
cells of mesencephalic origin to isolate and identify
several proteins that interact directly with nurr1 and
regulate its transcriptional activity. Notably, we
demonstrate that the mitogen-activated protein
kinases, ERK2 and ERK5, elevate, whereas LIM
Kinase 1 inhibits nurr1 transcriptional activity.
Furthermore, nurr1 recruits ERK5 to a NBREcontaining promoter and is a potential substrate
for this kinase. We have identified amino acids in
the A/B domain of nurr1 important for mediating the
ERK5 activating effects on nurr1 transcriptional
activity. Our results suggest that nurr1 acts as a
point of convergence for multiple signaling pathways that likely play a critical role in differentiation
and phenotypic expression of dopaminergic
(DAergic) neurons.

Neurons of the ventral midbrain area synthesizing the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) are implicated in disease states
where dopaminergic (DAergic) neurotransmission is deregulated. Parkinson’s disease is a result of a severely reduced
DAergic tone due to the degeneration of nigrostriatal neurons.
In contrast, elevated DAergic signaling is observed in
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders and drug addiction
(1). Although, these disorders have tremendous impact on
human health, their aetiologies are still unclear and therapeutic tools remain to be developed.
The transcription factor nurr1 [NR4A2; (2)] is highly
expressed in DAergic neurons of the midbrain (3) and
knock-out experiments in mice revealed that nurr1-mediated
transcriptional activities are limited primarily to the midbrain
DA neurons (4–6). Nurr1 is thought to play a key role in
maintenance of a DAergic phenotype via regulation of
DA neuron-specific genes [tyrosine hydroxylase (7–9); DA
transporter (DAT) (10,11)]. It also promotes survival of DA
neurons by protecting them from toxic insults (12). Thus,
nurr1 serves as a DA neuron-specific transcription factor
whose activities could be regulated to modulate DAergic
neurotransmission in Parkinson’s disease and other disorders.
Nurr1 is an atypical member of the nuclear receptor (NR)
superfamily comprising mostly ligand-activated receptors,
like glucocorticoid, estrogen and retinoic acid receptors,
which regulate gene expression via recognition of specific
DNA-binding sequences (13). Nurr1 shares with other NRs
a common structural organization: the N-terminus contains
an activation function 1 (AF1) involved in ligand-independent
transcriptional activity, and is the target for regulatory posttranslational modifications (14). The central region of the
protein consists of the highly conserved DNA-binding domain

(DBD) that allows recognition of specific DNA sequences
[hormone response elements (HREs)]. In the C-terminus,
generally identified as the ligand binding domain (LBD),
are located the dimerization interfaces for homo- and/or
heterodimerization between NRs, the ligand binding pocket
for the cognate ligand and the AF2, a highly conserved
module that confers the ability to recruit co-activators
(CoAs) and to induce transcriptional activity in response to
agonists [reviewed by (13)].
Upon binding of a cognate ligand, NRs undergo a conformational change inducing the loss of interaction with repressive proteins [known as co-repressors—CoRs; reviewed by
(13)] in favor of CoAs, promoting transcriptional activation.
Unlike other NRs, the amino acid sequence of the AF2
domain of nurr1 is not conserved (15) and its ability to transactivate reporter genes appears to be constitutive (15,16). This
receptor does not possess a typical ligand binding pocket.
In fact, crystallographic studies show that nurr1 assumes
the conformation of an active receptor even in the absence
of a ligand and is thought to lack a classic CoA binding interface (17). In addition, the nurr1 DBD recognizes an extended
HRE (NBRE—AAAGGTCA) and consequently can transactivate genes acting also as a monomer, unlike other NRs that
require formation of homo- or heterodimers (15,16,18).
Experiments reported to date show that nurr1 is an atypical
NR whose transcriptional activity is independent of its
interaction with classical NR CoAs, such as p160-related factors, CBP/p300 or the mediator complex. Only the rexinoid
receptor RXR and the repressor PIASg have thus far been
shown to interact directly with nurr1 and modulate its transcriptional activity (16,18–20). However, nurr1 function has
been shown to be cell type-specific (15), suggesting that
additional, as yet unidentified, cofactors are responsible for
the tight regulation of nurr1 activity.
Here, we report the screening of immortalized CSM14.1
mesencephalic cells and the consequent identification of
novel regulators of nurr1 activity. Notably, we establish
that several protein kinases, which belong to signaling
pathways known to regulate neuronal differentiation and
cell survival, are capable of modulating nurr1 transcriptional
activity. Our results suggest that these novel modulators are
potentially responsible for regulating nurr1-mediated processes in DAergic neurons, such as gene expression and
neuroprotection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids
Glutathione S-transferase (GST)–nurr1 fusion proteins were
constructed using PCR-generated fragments of mouse
pCMX-nurr1 subcloned into pDEST15 plasmid (Gateway)
following manufacturer’s instructions. The GST–LBD
construct coded for aa 327–598, while a SmaI restriction of
GST-A/B domain (1–262 amino acid) was used to subclone
plasmid GST-A/BD183 (1–183 amino acid). Constructs
were verified by automated sequencing and western blot.
Plasmids NBRE3xtkLuc, pCMX-nurr1 and pCMXnurr1DAF2 have been described elsewhere (16), while the
HA-tagged full-length human nurr1 was kindly donated by
M.N. Castel (Aventis Pharma). Nurr1 mutants DA[Q7-P58],

DB[I51-P127], DC[Y121-P169], DD[R166-Q180], DF[L368W420], DG[F426-G467], DH[Q473-R515], DI[K522-Q571],
S89A, T168A and S177A were obtained by site-directed
mutagenesis of plasmid pCMX-nurr1 using the Quick Change
Kit (Stratagene) following manufacturer’s instructions. Following the same procedures, pCMV-HA-ERK5 (obtained
from J. Dixon) was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to
obtain the kinase mutant forms, pHA-ERK5 AEF and pHAERK5 K83M. Wild-type (wt) ERK2 (pHA-ERK2), its constitutively active form (pCMV5-ERK2 L73P-His) and the
catalytic inactive form (pCMV-HA-ERK2 K52R) were
kindly provided by R. Davis, M. A. Emrick and P. Crespo,
respectively. The following plasmids were kind gifts: GSTLIM (I. Briche) coding for a LIM domain; pcDNA3-LIMKinase1 (LIMK1) (G. N. Gill) and pcDNA3-HA-LIMK1
kinase domain (H. Betz) coding, respectively for full-length
wt and the kinase domain only of LIMK1; pEBG-BMK1,
pFlag-BMK1/ERK5 wt and AEF (J. D. Lee); pMyc-HAMEK5 wt, dominant negative (dn) (K106M) and constitutively active (ca) (DD; M. Cobb) and ca RasL61 (R. Davis).
RT–PCR
Total RNA extraction and nurr1 amplification using specific
primers were carried out as described previously (16).
Cell lines and transfections
PC12 cells were grown and transfected as described previously (16). For statistical analysis, ANOVA and post tests
were performed using GraphPad prism software. CSM14.1
cells (21) were grown at 33 C in 5% CO2 humidified
atmosphere in DMEM high glucose (Invitrogen) containing
10% FBS (BioWhittacker) and supplemented with 2 mM
L-glutamine, 1000 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For IPs, cells were plated (3.5 · 106
cells) in 10 cm plates and transfected with LipofectAMINE
reagent (Invitrogen).
Preparation of CSM14.1 nuclear extracts—5 · 108
CSM14.1 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and harvested by trypsin. Pellet was resuspended in
4· Packet Cell Volume (PCV) buffer A [20 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 350 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM phenylmethlysulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM DTT, antiprotease cocktail
(Sigma)] and cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min.
After centrifugation, pellet was resuspended in 2 PCV buffer
A and dounced 15 times with pestle B. After centrifugation,
the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 0.5 PCV buffer A, 20%
glycerol and then 0.4 PCV buffer B [20 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.9), 1 M KCl, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT and antiprotease cocktail] was added dropwise. Nuclear fraction was
incubated for 45 min with gentle rocking at 4 C, centrifuged
and dialyzed overnight at 4 C against buffer C [20 mM
Tris–HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA and 20%
glycerol]. The extract was centrifuged and protein concentration was estimated by the Bradford Assay. Enrichment of the
nuclear fraction was verified by using specific antibodies
against nuclear proteins (TFIIB, RXR, SRC-1 and PARP-1)
and no contamination by these proteins was observed in the
cytosolic fraction.

GST-pulldown assays
GST–LIM fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli
BL21(DE3)pLysS following induction with 0.1 mM
isopropyl-b-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 h at 20 C.
Soluble bacterial lysates were added to glutathione Sepharose
beads (Amersham Biosciences), while 10 mg of the purified
GST–ERK2 fusion protein (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.)
were added to glutathione Sepharose beads. GST–ERK5
fusion protein was produced by transfecting CSM14.1 cells
with pEBG-BMK1/ERK5 and protein extraction was
performed as in co-immunoprecipitation and added to glutathione Sepharose beads. For binding assays, GST fusion
proteins bound to the Sepharose matrix were incubated with
35S-labeled proteins (TNT Quick coupled system, Promega)
for 3 h with gentle rocking at 4 C in GST-binding buffer
[20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.9), 180 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA,
0.05% NP-40, 0.5 mM PMSF and 1 mM DTT] containing
1 mg/ml BSA. After extensive washing, resine-bound proteins were resolved by SDS–PAGE. Gels were dried and
exposed for quantification with a Storm 860 phosphoimager
(Molecular Dynamics). Binding values obtained were normalized against the input in each gel and values (n ¼ 3–5)
were averaged and standardized compared to wt binding
(100%). For pulldown assays with nuclear extracts, GST
and GST-nurr1 proteins underwent double purification after
which purity and quantification of GST fusion protein were
estimated by silver nitrate staining. Binding with CSM14.1
nuclear extracts was performed as described previously (22)
overnight at 4 C and samples were resolved by 6–15% gradient SDS–PAGE. Following Colloidal Blue staining, proteins
were analyzed by mass spectroscopy.
Immunoblotting
GST-pulldown samples obtained using nuclear extracts were
resolved on 9% SDS–PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C, Amersham Biosciences).
Immunodetections were carried out as described previously
(16) using antibodies directed against RXRa (sc-553; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), ERK (610 123; BD Biosciences
Pharmingen) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Sigma).
Co-immunoprecipitations and DNA-IP assays
CSM14.1 cells were transfected with a HA-tagged nurr1
encoding plasmid and a second plasmid encoding for the
appropriate partner when necessary (see figure legend).
Cells were harvested in IP lysis buffer [20 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA,
1% Triton, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM bGlycerolphosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4 and 1 mg/ml Leupeptin].
Whole-cell extracts (1 mg) were incubated overnight at 4 C
with 25 ml anti-HA agarose conjugated beads (A-2095;
Sigma). After extensive washing, samples were resuspended
in sample buffer and resolved by SDS–PAGE. Detection
of HA-nurr1 was determined by immunoblotting using
an anti-HA antibody (H-9658; Sigma), while the coimmunoprecipitated proteins were revealed using antibodies
raised against ERK, BMK1/ERK5 (07–039; Upstate) and
LIMK1 (sc-5576).

For DNA-IP assays, CSM14.1 and PC12 cells were
transfected with HA-nurr1 and pGL3-NBRE3xtkLuc or
pGL3-tk-Luc plasmids. After 36 h of post-transfection, the
cells were washed in PBS containing 1 mM MgCl2 and
fixed in formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 15 min
at 37 C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of
200 mM glycine at room temperature. Cells were washed
twice in PBS/MgCl2 and scrapped in 1 ml ice-cold PBS.
Cells were lysed in 0.6 ml lysis buffer [1% SDS, 10 mM
EDTA, 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.1), 0.5 mM PMSF and
1· protease inhibitors (Sigma)]. DNA was sheared by
sonication and cell debris were eliminated by centrifugation.
Supernatant was diluted 10-fold in ChIP buffer [0.01% SDS,
1.1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.1),
150 mM NaCl and protease inhibitors] followed by immunoclearing with 100 ml of 50% protein A-agarose slurry
(16–125, Upstate) for 4 h at 4 C. Immunoprecipitations
were performed overnight at 4 C using 2–4 mg of specific
antibodies [anti-nurr1 (sc-990, Santa Cruz) and anti-BMK1/
ERK5 (Upstate)]. Complexes were collected by incubation
at 4 C for 2 h with 40 ml of 50% protein A-agarose slurry
in ChIP buffer plus 100 ml salmon sperm DNA and 2 mg
ovalbumin per ml. Beads were washed twice with low salt
buffer [0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM
Tris–HCl (pH 8.1) and 50 mM NaCl], once with LiCl Buffer
[0.25 M LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-CA630, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.1)]
and twice with TE Buffer [10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.1) and
1 mM EDTA]. Immune complexes were eluted overnight
at 65 C in elution buffer containing 0.1 M NaHCO3 and
1% SDS. DNA was purified with the QIAquick Spin kit
(Qiagen) and amplified by PCR using RVprimer3 and
GLprimer2 (Promega) as upstream and downstream primers,
respectively. Conditions were optimized to ensure linearity of
the PCR.
In vitro phosphorylation assays
GST fusion proteins (A/BD183 and GST only) were expressed
in E.coli and purified as described above. CSM14.1 cells were
lysed in IP lysis buffer and 400 mg of total proteins were incubated overnight at 4 C with an anti-ERK5 antibody followed
by addition of 60 ml of a 50% slurry of Protein A-agarose
for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 1 mg of
purified GST fusion proteins and 5 mCi of [g-32P]ATP in
50 ml of kinase buffer [25 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM
b-Glycerolphosphate, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM Na3VO4 and
10 mM MgCl2] for 30 min at 30 C. Kinase reactions were
terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer and samples
were resolved by SDS–PAGE. Equal loading of fusion proteins was verified by Coomassie blue staining of the SDS gel.

RESULTS
Isolation of nurr1-interacting proteins from CSM14.1
mesencephalic cells
Preliminary studies using in vitro pulldown assays showed
that the NR nurr1 does not interact with most known NR
CoAs [P. Sacchetti and P. Lefebvre, unpublished data; (17)].
These data, in addition to the observation that nurr1

5518

Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 19

transcriptional activity is cell type-specific, suggested that
nurr1 might interact with tissue-specific regulators present
only in nurr1-expressing cells. To identify novel modulators
of nurr1 activity, we examined a cell type closely related
to DAergic cells. The immortalized cell line, CSM14.1,
derived from primary foetal rat mesencephalic cells, has
been shown previously to express tyrosine hydroxylase and
nurr1 (23). Nurr1 mRNA was expressed at high levels in
CSM14.1 cells and modulated by forskolin as reported
previously [Supplementary Figure 7; (24)], while it was not
endogenously expressed in PC12 cells. We tested the ability
of nurr1 to increase expression levels of a reporter construct
encoding for a luciferase gene under the control of three
canonical nurr1 binding sites [NBRE3xtkLuc; (16)]. In
CSM14.1 cells, nurr1 was able to activate transcription of
this reporter gene (data not shown) suggesting that these
cells of mesencephalic origin express a functional nurr1
protein as well as its transcriptional partners.
We set up an affinity chromatography technique to identify
nurr1-interacting proteins in nuclear extracts of CSM14.1
cells. We engineered two nurr1 bait proteins (Figure 1A),
one coding for the N-terminus including the AF1 domain
(GST-A/BD183; 1–183 amino acid), and the other for the
C-terminus including the AF2 domain (GST–LBD; 327–598
amino acid). We then performed GST-pulldown assays by
coincubating the GST fusion proteins and CSM14.1 nuclear
extracts, and the bound proteins were resolved by SDS–
PAGE. Evaluation of the differential protein profiles retained
by the three GST fusion proteins was first performed by
silver stained gradient gels (Figure 1B). Only few bacterial
contaminants were retained non-specifically by the GST
bait alone or GST-nurr1 proteins in the absence of nuclear
extracts. Subsequently, identical experiments were performed
and the corresponding gels were Colloidal blue stained for
MALDI-TOF/MS mass spectroscopy analysis (Supplementary Figure 8). Bands of interest representing proteins that
were specifically retained by the nurr1 fusion proteins were
excised from Colloidal blue stained gels (corresponding
arrow heads, shown on silver nitrate stained gel; Figure 1B)
and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS mass spectroscopy for
identification of protein fragments as detailed in Supplementary Data. Proteins identified by mass spectroscopy analysis
were classified according to their functional role, as shown
in Supplementary Table 1. Strikingly, a large number of the
factors identified were members of signaling pathways (ERK,
Akt and LIMK1) and several were transcription factors,
most of which were NRs [RXRa, peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor g (PPARg) and farnesoid X receptor
(FXR)]. We also identified potential repressors NR corepressor 1 (NCoR-1 and Mxi1) and a protein implicated in
DNA repair mechanisms (PARP-1). Several of the potential
interactions were subsequently confirmed through independent in vitro experiments (Supplementary Figure 9)
and thus, proteins like Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1
(PARP-1), NCoR-1, PPARg, glucocorticoid receptor (GR;
R. Carpentier and P. Lefebvre, manuscript in preparation),
FXR and the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) were identified as new potential
transcriptional partners of nurr1.

an interaction between RXRa and the nurr1 GST–LBD fusion
protein was detected (Figure 1C), thus providing validation
for our screening system. Using an antibody capable of recognizing different forms of mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPK), a differential profile was observed with GST–
LBD versus GST-A/B protein (Figure 1C). Both A/B and
LBD domains interacted with ERKs (44/42 kDa), whereas
the LBD only interacted with big-mitogen-activated kinase
1 BMK1/ERK5 (ERK5, 85 kDa). None of the proteins tested
were found to interact non-specifically with the GST bait.
The question whether these proteins interact directly
with nurr1 was addressed by GST-pulldown experiments
using in vitro radiolabeled proteins and nurr1 fusion proteins
(see Figure 1A). Radiolabeled full-length LIM Kinase 1
(LIMK1) interacted with both nurr1 domains LBD and A/B
in similar manner, but not with GST alone (Figure 2A).
Similarly, the C-terminal part of LIMK that encodes for
its kinase domain displayed a strong interaction with both
LBD and A/B domains of nurr1, as shown in Figure 2A.
Nurr1 also interacted with a LIM domain-containing module

(similar to the LIMK1 module), when we incubated a GSTLIM construct overexpressed in bacteria and radiolabeled
nurr1 (Figure 2B). Thus, LIMK1 participates in a direct and
concomitant protein–protein interaction with nurr1 via its
LIM and kinase domains. We thought to verify that fulllength nurr1, and not only its separately expressed domains,
were capable of interacting with the proteins identified. We
radiolabeled nurr1 and incubated it with GST fusion constructs encoding for potential partners (Figure 2B). A strong
specific interaction was observed between nurr1 and ERK2.
Since the presence of ERK5 in the chromatography eluates
was confirmed by western blotting (Figure 1C), we tested
its interaction with nurr1 and obtained a positive signal
(Figure 2B).
Nurr1 interacts with LIM kinase 1, ERK2 and ERK5 in
intact CSM14.1 cells
We sought to establish that the observed physical interactions
detected in our in vitro experiments also occurred in intact

5520

mesencephalic cells. We performed co-immunoprecipitation
studies using CSM14.1 cells co-transfected with an expression plasmid coding for HA-tagged full-length human
nurr1, and plasmids encoding for the proteins identified
through our screening. An empty vector was used as negative
control. After overexpression of wt LIMK1, we observed an
interaction between LIMK1 and nurr1 (Figure 2C). A strong
interaction was detected between nurr1 and the constitutively
active form of ERK2 (ERK2 ca; Figure 2D), suggesting that
the catalytic activity of ERK2 is important for the interaction
with nurr1. We also performed experiments in vivo with
ERK5 and observed an interaction with nurr1 in CSM14.1
cells (Figure 2E). Identical results were obtained when
similar experiments were performed in the human embryonic
kidney 293-T cell line (data not shown).
Nurr1 has distinct binding sites for different kinases
We further dissected the A/B and LBD regions of nurr1 to
identify the specific binding domains implicated in the interaction with these protein kinases. Several minimal deletion
mutants in the A/B (DA-D) and LBD (DF-I) domains of
nurr1 were engineered (Figure 3A), in vitro radiolabeled
and tested by GST-pulldown experiments with LIM domains
of LIMK1, wt ERK2 and wt ERK5 proteins. As summarized
in Figure 3A and shown in the representative experiments
in Figure 3B, deletion of the region spanning from amino
acid 1 to 52 of nurr1 did not affect its interaction with any
of the kinases. Interestingly, deletion of the AF1 core domain
(amino acid 52–84; DB) partially altered the physical binding
of nurr1 with both MAPKs (ERK2 and ERK5), but not with
LIMK1. Deletion of amino acid 166–180 (DD) severely
impaired the binding of nurr1 to LIMK1 and partially to
ERK2, but did not interfere with ERK5 interaction
(Figure 3). On the other hand, the mutant DF (deleted from
amino acid 368 to 420) was the only one to lose its ability
to bind to ERK5, validating the previously observed binding
of ERK5 to the LBD and not to the A/B domain of nurr1
(Figure 1C). The mutant DF also showed a lower binding to
LIMK1, suggesting that this hinge region may play an important role in protein–protein interactions. Mutations in the
C-terminal domain of nurr1 (DG-DAF2) mostly affected the
interaction of nurr1 with LIMK1, in particular, as shown in
Figure 3, more dramatic effects were obtained with mutants
DH and DI. Loss of the AF2 domain (nurr1-DAF2) affected
only the interaction with ERK5. Taken together, these data
confirms that nurr1 interacts via distinct and separate binding
sites to the different protein kinases identified by affinity
chromatography, arguing for a specificity of the binding of
Nurr1 to these novel partners.
ERK2 and LIMK1 are co-regulators of nurr1
Given that nurr1 transcriptional activity is not regulated by a
cognate ligand and known CoAs, we postulated that posttranslational modifications could play a major role in modulating its activity. Thus, we were interested in characterizing
the effects of the protein kinases identified on nurr1 activity.
We tested the ability of the interacting factors to alter nurr1
function in PC12 cells which do not express nurr1 and have
been used extensively to study nurr1 functional activity (16).
Cells were transiently transfected with the NBRE3xtkLuc

reporter construct and we studied the effects of overexpressing different proteins on nurr1 transcriptional activity.
As previously shown (16), the reporter construct is devoid of
activity in this cell line and overexpression of the different
kinases tested did not alter its basal activity (see insets
Figure 4A and B).
As shown in Figure 4A, overexpressing increasing amounts
of wt ERK2 did not strongly alter the effect of nurr1 on the
NBRE3xtkLuc construct. In contrast, the constitutively active
form of ERK2 (ERK2 ca) was able to further enhance the
nurr1-induced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner.
These results together with the Co-IP shown in Figure 2D
suggest that the catalytic activity of ERK2 is essential for
the interaction of the kinase with nurr1. To validate the role
of ERK2 activation in the regulation of nurr1 activity, we
used a kinase-dead form of ERK2 (K52R) containing a mutation that disrupts ATP-binding and thus prevents phosphorylation of substrates (25). Contrary to the effects observed with
the ca and wt forms of ERK2, increasing doses of the K52R
mutant did not further enhance the nurr1-induced activity of
the NBRE3x construct (Figure 4A). Thus, these results
suggest that a functional ERK2 kinase activity is required
to affect nurr1 transcriptional activity. Conversely, overexpression of wt LIMK1 protein strongly repressed the
transcriptional effects producing up to 45% inhibition of
the nurr1-induced luciferase activity (Figure 4B), without
affecting the basal activity of the NBRE3x construct alone
(inset). Thus, our functional experiments strengthen the coimmunoprecipitation results (Figure 2C and D) and underscore the existence of a physical and functional link between
nurr1 and the catalytic activities of ERK2 and LIMK1.
Big-mitogen kinase 1/ERK5 enhances nurr1
transcriptional activity in vivo
Our screening also identified the MAPK/ERK kinase
5 (MEK5) as a potential modulator of nurr1 activity
(Supplementary Table 1). Co-immunoprecipitation and GSTpulldown experiments established an interaction between
nurr1 and ERK5 (Figures 2 and 3), the direct substrate of
MEK5. We therefore tested whether overexpressing components of the MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway altered nurr1
activity. Increasing doses of wt ERK5 did not affect the
basal activity of the NBRE3xtkLuc construct in the absence
of nurr1 (Figure 5A). Whereas nurr1-induced activation of
the luciferase construct was significantly enhanced by wt
ERK5 in a dose-dependent manner. We then tested the
effects of MEK5 on the transcriptional activity of nurr1
using MEK5 wt, ca and dn forms (Figure 5B). As observed
previously, none of the constructs activated non-specifically
the NBRE3xtkLuc reporter, while nurr1 alone or in the presence of ERK5 increased luciferase activity. Cotransfection of
nurr1, ERK5 and wt MEK5 as well as its ca form significantly enhanced luciferase levels, whereas the dn MEK5
had no significant effect (Figure 5B). To verify that ERK5
is indeed the conduit for transduction of MEK5 signal, we
used a Flag-tagged wt ERK5 construct (Flag-ERK5 wt) as
well as a ERK5 mutant lacking both activation sites for
MEK5 (Flag-ERK5 AEF). In the presence of wt ERK5, constitutively active MEK5 was able to enhance nurr1-induced
luciferase expression (Figure 5C). However, the level of

luciferase expression due to the coexpression of nurr1 and
the ERK5 AEF mutant did not change in the presence of
MEK5 ca, suggesting that MEK5 could modulate nurr1
activity essentially through ERK5 activation. Surprisingly,

the unphosphorylated AEF mutant was still capable of
enhancing nurr1 activity, even in the absence of MEK5 contribution (Figure 5C). It has been previously suggested that,
in non-activating conditions, ERK5 AEF could act as the

wild-type form since it still retains the capacity to activate
known substrates (26). Thus, to determine if basal ERK5
activity was sufficient to affect nurr1 transcriptional activity,
we co-expressed nurr1 and different forms of ERK5 (HAERK5 wt, AEF and the kinase-dead ERK5 mutant K83M)
and measured NBRE luciferase levels (Figure 5D). Wt
ERK5 and the AEF mutant further enhanced nurr1-induced
luciferase activity, with the mutant showing stronger activating effects on nurr1 activity (the HA-tagged AEF construct
showed higher effects on nurr1 activity than the Flag-tagged
construct; compare Figure 5C and D). Importantly, the
kinase-dead mutant had no effects at any of the doses used.

Hence, the basal activity of ERK5 seems sufficient to affect
nurr1 function without excluding that, in particular conditions, activation of MEK5 could further contribute to the
modulation of nurr1 transcriptional activity.
To clarify the mechanism by which ERK5 transduces its
activating properties on nurr1, we asked if the transcriptional
effects observed were correlated with an interaction between
nurr1 and ERK5 on DNA. Because of the lack of direct
nurr1 binding response elements in the promoters of DAergic
target genes, we used the NBRE reporter construct for our
DNA immunoprecipitation assays, a system previously used
to explore NRs transactivation mechanisms (27). Thus, we
tested the recruitment of the two proteins on the NBREcontaining reporter plasmid by DNA immunoprecipitation
assay (Figure 6A) using antibodies specific to nurr1 and
ERK5. Immunoprecipitation followed by PCR amplification
of the DNA fragment encompassing the three NBRE response
elements showed that nurr1 and ERK5 were both strongly
bound to this response element in vivo, suggesting that
ERK5 interacts with DNA-bound nurr1 and acts as transcriptional activator. This recruitment was not observed on a promoter deprived of the nurr1 binding sites (pGL3-tk-Luc;
Figure 6A). Identical DNA immunoprecipitation results
were obtained in CSM14.1 and PC12 cells, confirming our
functional studies obtained in the later cell type (Figure 5).
These studies suggested that the kinase activity of ERK5
was involved in enhancing nurr1 activity. Thus, we wondered
if nurr1 could be a new substrate for this kinase and tested the
ability of ERK5 to phosphorylate GST–nurr1 fusion proteins
in vitro. Therefore, we immunoprecipitated endogenous
ERK5 from CSM14.1 cells and co-incubated GST fusion
proteins coding for the A/B domain of nurr1 with the precipitated kinase in the presence of radioactive ATP. As
shown in Figure 6B, nurr1 A/B domain was significantly
phosphorylated by ERK5, while the GST protein alone was
not a substrate for this kinase. We attempted to activate the
endogenous MEK-ERK5 pathway by stimulating CSM14.1
cells with EGF for 15 min and verify the phosphorylation
state of nurr1. Figure 6B shows the EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK5, as shown by western blot, however
no changes were observed in the phosphorylation state of
nurr1. These data would suggest once again that the basal
activity of ERK5 is responsible for the phosphorylation of
nurr1. To establish which amino acids were implicated
in ERK5-mediated phosphorylation, several residues in the
A/B domain of nurr1 were mutated to alanines. First, we
observed that all point mutations had a high basal activity
which was comparable to wt nurr1 plus ERK5 (Figure 6C)
and that, similarly to wt nurr1, the S89A mutant response
was significantly enhanced in the presence of ERK5. On
the other hand, the activity of the T168A mutant was only
slightly increased in the presence of the kinase, while the
S177A mutant lost completely its capacity to be activated
by ERK5. Thus, residues T168 and S177 appeared to be
implicated in the activation of nurr1 transcriptional activity
by ERK5. All together these results suggest that nurr1 is a
downstream target of the MEK5-ERK5 signaling pathway,
as suggested by the recruitment of ERK5 to the NBRE, the
phosphorylation of nurr1 N-terminal by this same kinase
and the capacity of MEK5 and ERK5 to increase nurr1
transcriptional activity.

DISCUSSION
DAergic neurons are essential for the appropriate functioning
of brain areas controlling motor behavior, motivation and the
reward system, and diseases inducing imbalances in DAergic
neurotransmission are very debilitating (1). The orphan NR
nurr1 is a transcription factor highly expressed in mesencephalic DAergic neurons and it plays a major role in the
development and maintenance of the phenotype of these
cells. However, how nurr1 is tightly regulated and controls
DAergic neuronal function is presently unknown. Target
genes implicated in DAergic phenotype specification and
directly bound by nurr1 still remain to be identified. For
example, the DAT has been described as a nurr1-target gene,
but its activation occurs via an indirect mechanism (10).

Nurr1 has a high tissue-specific activity and does not recruit
classical NR CoAs, at least in vitro [P. Sacchetti and
P. Lefebvre, unpublished data; (15,17)], suggesting that
nurr1 transcriptional activity might be regulated by interactions with, and/or modifications induced by, tissue-specific
factors. The well characterized nurr1-RXR heterodimers
(16,19) do not control nurr1-regulated expression of phenotypic marker genes, e.g. DAT (10), thus rendering necessary
the identification of other partners to understand the transcriptional mechanisms used by nurr1 to regulate gene expression
in DA cells. To identify proteins involved in the regulation
of nurr1 transcriptional activity in neuronal cells, we used
an affinity chromatography system and embryonic cells of
mesencephalic origin (CSM14.1) that endogenously express

nurr1. We focused on validating interactions between nurr1
and proteins expressed in mesencephalic neurons for which
we could envisage a physiological role.
Using this affinity chromatography screen coupled to mass
spectroscopy, we have confirmed the interaction between
nurr1 and RXR and we also identified novel interactions
with NRs and other transcription factors in CSM14.1 cells.
Our screening confirmed previously obtained in vitro results
showing that nurr1 does not interact with most of the known
NR cofactors (15,17). In fact, in our assays we only detected

an interaction with the NR repressor NCoR-1, which was
further confirmed by GST-pulldown experiments (Supplementary Figure 9). However, the mass spectroscopy analysis
identified new potential dimer partners of nurr1 pertaining to
the NR superfamily, like the PPARg, glucocorticoid receptor
(GR; R. Carpentier and P. Lefebvre, manuscript in preparation) and FXR, and using several techniques (western blot,
GST-pulldown and Co-IPs) we confirmed these physical
interactions (Supplementary Figure 9) and are currently
evaluating the functional roles of these dimers.
However, this screening method enabled us to identify
not only direct binding partners (Figure 2), but also proteins
that at first glance were unlikely to interact directly with a
transcription factor, like MEK and p21-activated kinase,
also known as PAK (Supplementary Table 1). It is possible
that these proteins interact with direct binding partners of
nurr1 and still participate in the modulation of nurr1 activity
as components of a larger multiprotein complex, as previously exemplified by the identification of the DRIP–TRAP
complex (22,28).
Together with the closely related nur77 and nor1, nurr1
constitutes the NGFI-B subfamily of NRs (29). Given that
nur77 is highly phosphorylated [(14,30,31) and references
therein], nurr1 could be a phosphoprotein as well. Several
of the identified nurr1-interacting factors are signaling
proteins pertaining to phosphorylation cascades that could
modify nurr1 via post-translational modifications. Therefore,
we focused on analyzing in depth the effects of a selected
group of kinases and their capacity to alter transcriptional
activity on a canonical nurr1 response element.
The kinase LIMK1 is known to interact with p57kip2,
a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor essential during
embryogenesis. This interaction induces translocation of the
complex LIMK1/p57kip2 to the nucleus, thus limiting the
cytoplasmic activity of the kinase, and targeting its action
to the nucleus (32). Interestingly, both nurr1 and p57kip2 are
involved in cell cycle arrest and differentiation and a direct
interaction between these two proteins has been recently
demonstrated, which results in inhibition of nurr1 transcriptional activity (33). We report here a direct interaction
between LIMK1 and nurr1, suggesting the possible existence
of a complex consisting of these three proteins. Since LIMK1
(Figure 5B) and p57kip2 (33) have an inhibitory effect on
nurr1 transcriptional function, it is conceivable that the
nuclear translocation of the LIMK1–p57kip2 complex plays
a regulatory role in nurr1 activity. Thus, the existence of a
LIMK1/p57kip2–nurr1 protein complex and the characterization of its effects in nurr1-mediated gene expression deserve
deeper analysis. In addition, LIM-containing proteins can
recruit the Sin3A–histone deacetylase co-repressor complex
(34) and inhibit gene transcription, a mechanism well
described for NRs (13) that could participate in the inhibition
of nurr1 activity by LIMK1.
MAP kinases are essential for neuronal differentiation
and neurotrophin signal transduction (35), and activation
of the MEK/ERK cascade is involved in regulation of
several transcription factors, including those belonging to
the NGFI-B family. In particular, ERK2 phosphorylates the
nur77 receptor in vitro (36) and in vivo (37), and MEK
mutants can alter nur77 transcriptional responses on specific
response elements (30). Further, the pharmacological MEK

Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, No. 19

inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) have been shown to repress
nurr1 transcriptional activity (38) and in our studies they were
the only molecules able to inhibit Ras-induced nurr1 activation (P. Sacchetti and P. Lefebvre, unpublished data). We
show here a direct in vivo physical and functional interaction
between nurr1 and ERK2 that seems to rely on the activation
status of ERK2. The two proteins bind each other and
our data support the existence of a MAPK docking site in
nurr1, located between amino acids 160 and 188, which is
involved in ERK2–nurr1 interaction. The existence of a
docking site on the substrate recognized by MAPKs seems
to be an essential prerequisite for guiding the specificity of
interaction between kinase and substrate. However, Co-IPs
evidenced a much stronger interaction of nurr1 with the
constitutively active form of ERK2, suggesting that in vivo
the activation status of ERK2 is important to stabilize the
interaction with nurr1. This conclusion is further supported
by our functional experiments that show an enhanced nurr1
activity in the presence of a catalytically active ERK2
(wt and ca ERK2), but not in the presence of a kinase-dead
mutant (K52R). The existence of a bona fide docking site
on nurr1 would suggest a direct protein–protein interaction
between this transcription factor and the kinase; however,
none of the data exclude the existence of a possible intermediate protein conveying the signal from ERK2 to nurr1.
Interestingly, ERK2 is capable of interacting directly with
PAK2 and p85 bPIX (Supplementary Table 1) and this multimeric complex is activated via the Ras/MEK/ERK cascade
in response to bFGF (39), a stimulus involved in mesencephalic cell development. Our studies showed that nurr1
can interact in vitro and in vivo with p85 bPIX, even if this
interaction does not seem to affect nurr1 transcriptional
response on a NBRE element (data not shown). Additionally,
the post-translational modifications induced by these
signaling molecules could affect nurr1 interactions with
cofactors, and changes in the phosphorylation state of nurr1
could thus be directly implicated in recruitment of CoAs
and CoRs.
It remains to be determine if ERK2 is involved in regulating the basal activity of nurr1 or a stimulus-induced activity
and to define which cellular signal activates ERK2 to affect
nurr1. In this regard, recent studies in DAergic primary cultures have linked the DA-induced activation of the ERK pathway to the activation of nurr1 and highlighted the importance
of this step in the development of DAergic neurons (40).
An interesting link between nurr1 and neuroprotection is
delineated by the interaction that we identified between
nurr1 and the MAP kinase, ERK5. In fact, ERK5 is known
to play a critical role in neuronal survival (41) and recent
studies have established its involvement specifically in neuroprotection of DAergic neurons resulting from oxidative stress
(J. E. Cavanaugh et al., 34th Annual Meeting Soc. Neurosci.,
abstr. 221.3, 2004). Importantly, overexpression of nurr1
results in cell resistance to MPTP, a selective DAergic neurotoxin used to mimic neuronal degeneration in Parkinson’s
disease (42), and its reduced expression renders animals
more susceptible to this neurotoxin (12), suggesting a neuroprotective role for nurr1 in DAergic cells. Thus, the direct
interaction that we observed between nurr1 and ERK5
suggests a potential mechanism through which nurr1 prevents
neurotoxic responses in DA neurons. Our data establish the

5525

role of the MEK-ERK5 pathway on the regulation of nurr1.
Activation of MEK, which in turns activates ERK5, does
enhance the ERK5-induced nurr1 activity, while no increase
is observed in the presence of a dn MEK5 or of the unphosphorylated ERK5 AEF, in which amino acids phosphorylated
by MEK5 are mutated. In addition, an inhibition of nurr1
transcriptional activity was observed when using the pharmacological MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 (data not
shown), molecules that block not only ERK1/2-, but also
ERK5 activation by upstream kinases. Thus, the inhibitory
effect of these compounds on nurr1 activity observed by us
and others [data not shown; (38)] may be explained by the
inhibition of the MEK5/ERK5 signaling cascade. Taken
together, these data suggest that activation of the MEKERK5 pathway could result in enhanced nurr1 transcriptional
responses. However, the AEF form, which cannot be activated, is still capable of stimulating nurr1 as potently as the
wt form, suggesting that activation by MEK is not necessary
for ERK5 to regulate nurr1 activity. Additionally, the phosphorylation status of nurr1 is not further enhanced after
activation of this signalling pathway by EGF, and nurr1 transcriptional activity is left unaffected only by the kinase-dead
form of ERK5 (K83M). Thus, ERK5 basal activity could be
sufficient to modulate nurr1 responses. Similarly, the basal
activity of ERK5 has been shown recently to be sufficient
in mediating survival of leukaemia cells, by affecting the
oncogenic variant v-Abl of the tyrosine kinase c-Abl (26).
Thus, it would be plausible for ERK5 and nurr1 to cooperate
in homeostatic conditions to ensure maintenance and survival
of DAergic neurons; while, under stressful conditions, activation of MEK5 would result in further enhancement of the
cooperative effects of these proteins.
Could nurr1 be a direct substrate for ERK5? The two proteins can interact in vivo and this interaction is mediated
through a region in the nurr1 LBD (amino acids 360–420)
in vitro. The A/B domain of nurr1 is highly phosphorylated
in the presence of ERK5 and mutations of two amino
acids in this same domain decrease significantly the ERK5mediated nurr1 transcriptional response. The specificity and
efficiency of action of MAPKs is usually conferred through
docking interactions between the kinases and their substrate.
Thus, ERK5 would dock on its substrate and phosphorylate the acceptor residues, which are different from the
docking residues (43). The lack of similarity of the nurr1
360–420 amino acid region to the canonical MAPK docking
site and the lack of a definitive proof for a direct phosphorylation of S177 and T168 by ERK5 leave open the possibility
that nurr1 is not a direct substrate for ERK5. Although we
do not favor this hypothesis in light of our current data,
these effects could be indirect and mediated through a previously characterized ERK5 substrate, like the transcription
factors MEF2 (43). However, we were not able to detect a
direct interaction between nurr1 and MEF2C, as tested by
GST-pulldown (data not shown), leaving open the search
for a potential mediator of the effects of ERK5 on nurr1
transcriptional activity.
Taken together, our data identify ERK5 as the first
described transcriptional activator of nurr1. In fact, the
recruitment of ERK5 on a nurr1 response element provides a direct proof of the implication of this kinase in
the modulation of nurr1 activity at the transcriptional level.

At the physiological level, activation of this oxidative
stress-related pathway is of particular interest in the context
of neuroprotection of DAergic neurons against toxic insults.
Stimulation of ERK5 and the consequent enhancement
of nurr1 activity could be aimed at altering expression of
genes related to cell protection. Clearly, confirmation of
this hypothesis would necessitate the identification of new
nurr1-target genes implicated in cell survival.
In summary, using our screening methodology we have
identified signaling cascades that regulate nurr1 activity
(ERK2, LIMK1 and MEK5/ERK5) as well as potential functional partners of nurr1 in transcription and survival/
apoptosis. Initially, we had hypothesized that tissue-specific
factors would regulate nurr1 transcriptional activity. However, our results point to a complex network of signaling
pathways participating in the modulation of nurr1 activity,
and most likely, the integration of their combinatorial action
results in the observed in vivo cell-specific functions of this
transcription factor. Future studies should focus on testing
the ability of the newly identified regulators to alter the
expression of DAergic genes modulated by nurr1 directly
or indirectly, like DAT and TH, in their appropriate cell
context. Clearly, these data would validate the relevance of
the findings presented here as well as open new perspectives
to unravel the mechanisms used by this atypical NR to control expression of genes specifying the DAergic neuronal
phenotype.
