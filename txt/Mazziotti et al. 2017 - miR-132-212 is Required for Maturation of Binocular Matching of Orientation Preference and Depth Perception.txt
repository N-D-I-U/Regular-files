MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to mediate post-transcriptional gene regulation, but their
role in postnatal brain development is still poorly explored. We show that the expression of
many miRNAs is dramatically regulated during functional maturation of the mouse visual
cortex with miR-132/212 family being one of the top upregulated miRNAs. Age-downregulated transcripts are signiﬁcantly enriched in miR-132/miR-212 putative targets and in
genes upregulated in miR-132/212 null mice. At a functional level, miR-132/212 deletion affects
development of receptive ﬁelds of cortical neurons determining a speciﬁc impairment of
binocular matching of orientation preference, but leaving orientation and direction selectivity
unaltered. This deﬁcit is associated with reduced depth perception in the visual cliff test.
Deletion of miR-132/212 from forebrain excitatory neurons replicates the binocular matching
deﬁcits. Thus, miR-132/212 family shapes the age-dependent transcriptome of the visual
cortex during a speciﬁc developmental window resulting in maturation of binocular cortical
cells and depth perception.

M

icroRNAs (miRNAs) are an endogenous class of small
non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by
causing degradation or translational repression of their
target messenger RNAs (mRNAs)1. In the last decades, miRNAs
have been involved in the physiology of all tissues through the
control of a wide variety of signalling pathways. At cerebral level,
miRNAs have been mainly studied during early phases of
development2 or in models of neuropathological disease3 and
neural plasticity4–7. Recent evidence has demonstrated that visual
experience is able to inﬂuence cortical levels of speciﬁc
miRNAs8,9 and that tight regulation of miR-132 levels is
required for ocular dominance (OD) plasticity during a
sensitive period of development8–11. However, neither miR-132
nor other miRNAs have ever been investigated in the context of
physiological maturation of cortical functions. Studies performed
in rodents have shown that visual cortical neurons display
functional properties, such as orientation and direction selectivity,
emerging during early windows of development and relatively
insensitive to visual experience12–15, whereas other properties
mature later during development and are more sensitive to the
visual input13,16–18. A remarkable example is the binocular
matching of orientation preference that develops during the
critical period (CP) for OD plasticity and is strongly dependent
on visual experience19–23. Indeed, before CP opening neuronal
visual responses show a different preferred orientation between
the two eyes that gradually matches during the CP. Eventually,
adult cortical neurons show similar orientation preference for the
two eyes, albeit some misaligned cells can persist19,24,25. We
reasoned that miRNAs undergoing developmentally regulated
expression during this period of functional maturation are likely
candidates as key molecular mediators of cortical development.
Thus, we analysed miRNAs regulated during visual cortical
development by performing an RNA sequencing analysis of
miRNAs expressed in the visual cortex immediately before eye
opening (P10) and when molecular mechanisms underlying
development of mouse visual function are fully engaged (P28;
refs 12,14,15,18,19). To investigate miRNA targets, mRNAs from
the same samples were also analysed. We found that many
miRNAs undergo a strong expression change during this period
of development. In particular, miR-132 family, represented by
miR-132-3p and miR-212-5p, was one of the top three
upregulated miRNAs with a corresponding signiﬁcant
downregulation of its putative target mRNAs. Therefore, we
decided to study age-dependent transcriptomic regulation and the
development of visual cortical receptive ﬁelds (RF) in mice with
deletion of the genomic locus coding for both miR-132 and miR212 (ref. 26). These mice showed an upregulation of miR-132/212
targets that are normally downregulated with age, and displayed a
selective impairment in the binocular matching of orientation
preference of cortical units similar to that observed in
monocularly deprived (MD) wild-type (wt) mice. Strikingly, the
same effect was present when miR-132/212 was selectively deleted
in the excitatory neurons of the forebrain. From a behavioural
point of view, miR-132/212 null animals exhibited impaired depth
perception in the visual cliff test. Finally, the deﬁcit in binocular
matching and stereoscopic vision was still persistent in adult miR132/212 null mice suggesting that miR-132/212 is necessary to
orchestrate the adaptive reﬁnement of visual circuits during a
speciﬁc sensitive period of development.
Results
MiR-132 affects age-dependent visual cortical transcriptome.
To investigate miRNA expression during postnatal development
we performed RNA sequencing of small RNAs extracted from
the visual cortex of P10 and P28 mice. A total of 176,228,828
2

raw reads were generated. On average 94.5% (s.d. ¼ 0.64) of the
reads could be aligned. 2,164 isomiRs (Supplementary Data 1)
and 299 precursors (Supplementary Data 1 and Fig. 1a) were
found to have age-regulated expression. Mir-29a, miR-219,
miR-338 and miR-132 were the miRNAs undergoing the strongest upregulation during development, a result conﬁrmed by
reverse transcription PCR (Supplementary Fig. 1) and in agreement with previous data8, whereas miR-298, miR-149 and miR331 were the top downregulated miRNAs. The corresponding
miRNA families were also the strongest regulated families
(Supplementary Data 1). Among the members of the miR-132
family, miR-132-3p and miR-212-5p were the only miRNAs
represented at high levels.
Then, we investigated the impact of developmental regulation
of miR-132-3p and miR-212-5p on gene expression by analysing
the transcriptome in the same samples used for the small RNA
sequencing. 4,339 genes were signiﬁcantly upregulated and 5,429
genes were downregulated in the P28 visual cortex with respect to
the P10 cortex (Supplementary Data 2). Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis (Fig. 1b,c)
revealed that some pathways were in common between
upregulated (Supplementary Data 2) and downregulated
(Supplementary Data 2) genes, whereas other pathways were
signiﬁcantly enriched only in one of these groups. Many
pathways previously involved in cortical development and
plasticity were affected27–31 strengthening the predictive validity
of our analysis. Indeed, MAPK signalling, neurotrophin
signalling, glutamatergic synapse, neuroactive ligand-receptor
interaction, insulin signalling pathways were signiﬁcantly
enriched in both upregulated and downregulated genes;
regulation of actin cytoskeleton, circadian rhythm—mammal
and chemokine signalling pathways were present only in
upregulated genes; axon guidance, RNA transport, gap junction,
long-term potentiation, long-term depression and mTOR
signalling pathways were present only in the downregulated
genes. Many of the developmentally regulated genes were
predicted targets of multiple miRNAs (Supplementary Data 2).
Importantly, there was a highly signiﬁcant and speciﬁc overlap
between the predicted targets of miR-132-3p and the genes
downregulated with age (Supplementary Data 2, 181 genes, odds
ratio 2.10; Fisher exact test Po0.0001). MiR-212-5p targets were
also signiﬁcantly enriched in age-downregulated genes albeit with
a minor odds ratio than miR-132-3p (Supplementary Data 2, 132
genes, odds ratio ¼ 1.74; Fisher exact test Po0.0001). This result
is in agreement with the hypothesis that miR-132/212 ageregulated increase contributes to repress the expression of a
signiﬁcant number of genes during visual cortical development.
To independently test this hypothesis, we performed RNA
sequencing on P28 visual cortical samples obtained from mice
with germ-line deletion of the miR-132/212 locus. 1698 genes
were differentially expressed between mutant and wt mice
(Supplementary Data 3). Intriguingly, KEGG pathway analysis
revealed that 53 out of the 61 KEGG categories enriched with
genes upregulated in miR-132/212 null mice were also present in
the KEGG categories downregulated during normal development,
suggesting that a substantial part of the rearrangement in
molecular pathways occurring during normal development is
altered in miR-132/212 mutants. Moreover, a signiﬁcant enrichment in miR-132-3p targets was present in the genes upregulated
in the miR-132/212 mutant cortex (54 genes, odds ratio 5.07;
Fisher exact test Po0.0001, Supplementary Data 3), whereas the
enrichment in miR-212-5p targets was not signiﬁcant (14 genes,
odds ratio 1.50; Fisher exact test P ¼ 0.13, Supplementary Data 3).
Importantly, there was an overlap (39 genes) between the miR132-3p targets and genes that were both downregulated by age
and upregulated by miR-132/212 deletion (Fig. 1d). This gene set

included genes important for brain development such as MeCP2,
Sox5, Sox11 and Pten (Supplementary Data 4). Thus, in the
absence of miR-132 family the developmental downregulation of
a signiﬁcant number of miR-132-3p targets does not occur,
conﬁrming the importance of miR-132-3p developmental regulation in deﬁning the transcriptomic changes occurring between
P10 and P28 in the visual cortex.
Mir-132/212 null mice show normal monocular RF properties.
We investigated whether the lack of miR-132/212 cluster was able
to inﬂuence functional development of the visual cortex. We ﬁrst
analysed monocular tuning properties in sorted units recorded by

multisite silicon electrode tetrodes inserted at depths sampling
from layers III to V in binocular visual cortex of P27-28 wt and
null mice. Orientation and direction selectivity was measured on
responses to drifting sinusoidal gratings calculating three different parameters: orientation selectivity index (OSI), orientation
tuning width and direction selectivity index (DSI)15,32. Each
index was separately computed for the contralateral and
ipsilateral eye responses. No difference between wt and null
mice was present for all these indexes (One-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA), P ¼ 0.159, P ¼ 0.595 and P ¼ 0.262
respectively; Fig. 2a–e) indicating that the maturation of these
properties does not require miR-132/212.

characterization of single-unit responses. (b) Orientation tuning curves of a visually responsive unit for wt (left, N ¼ 6 mice, n ¼ 132 cells) and miR-132/212
mutant (right, N ¼ 6 mice, n ¼ 186 cells) mice. The black lines are ﬁtted curves of the response magnitudes (open circles). Spike rasters of representative
unit phase-locked response to preferred drifting sine gratings are also depicted. No difference in orientation selectivity (c), orientation tuning width (d) and
direction selectivity (e) is observed in contralateral and ipsilateral responses of mutant mice compared to wt animals. Error bars represent s.e.m.

Mir-132/212 null mice show impaired binocular matching.
Previous data showed that after orientation selectivity completes
its developmental trajectory, there is a process of binocular
matching of preferred orientation19. To further analyse the role of
miR-132/212 in visual cortical development, we assessed
binocular matching of orientation preference in P27-28 null
and wt mice. We found that mutant mice had a signiﬁcantly
worse binocular matching of orientation preference with respect
to wt age-matched littermates (Two-way ANOVA, effect of
genotype Po0.001; post hoc Holm-Sidak test, Po0.01; Fig. 3a,b),
suggesting that the lack of miR-132 family speciﬁcally disrupts
this late developing property of visual cortical neurons while
keeping monocular tuning properties intact. Intriguingly, the
defective binocular matching of orientation preference present in
P27-28 miR-132/212 null mice persists into adulthood. Indeed, we
measured binocular matching in adult P60 mutant and wt mice
and we found that also at this age binocular matching was
dramatically impaired in miR-132/212 null mice (post hoc HolmSidak test, Po0.001; Fig. 3a), despite a normal orientation
selectivity of visual cortical neurons (Two-way ANOVA, effect of
genotype P ¼ 0.133; Supplementary Fig. 2A).
Single-unit data pooled from many animals can be biased
towards those individual animals in which the largest number of
units were studied. Therefore, we next analysed the results by
case. Even with this analysis, binocular matching resulted to be
strongly impaired in miR-132/212 null mice both at P27-28 and
P60 (Two-way ANOVA, effect of genotype Po0.001; post hoc
Holm-Sidak test, wt versus KO: P27-28 Po0.01, P60 Po0.001;
Supplementary Fig. 2B).
Visual cortical neurons can be classiﬁed into simple and
complex cells based on their response properties32,33. Since it has
been recently reported that during physiological development
simple cells fulﬁl the process of binocular matching of orientation
preference before complex cells19–23, we studied the degree of
binocular matching in simple and complex cells of null mice.
Simple cells of null mice only showed a statistically nonsigniﬁcant
trend for binocular mismatching with respect to wt animals (ttest, P ¼ 0.07; Fig. 3c), while the binocular matching of complex
cells was signiﬁcantly disrupted (t-test, Po0.01; Fig. 3d).
4

Consistently with the results reported for the whole-cell
population, monocular orientation tuning properties of both
simple and complex cells were normal (One-way ANOVA
P ¼ 0.624 and P ¼ 0.524, respectively; Fig. 3e,f). These results
are in line with the hypothesis that miR-132 family is particularly
important for the late development of binocular neuronal
properties.
Since narrow-spiking units are known to be poorly orientation
selective32, an abnormally high presence of narrow-spiking units
in miR-132/212 null mice could contribute to the low binocular
matching of orientation preference observed in mutant mice. To
test this possibility we classiﬁed neuronal units into two different
classes, narrow spiking and broad spiking (Fig. 3g), on the basis of
their spike waveform. This waveform signature is used to
distinguish putative excitatory and fast spiking inhibitory
neurons32. We found that 5.4% of miR-132/212 mutant units
belonged to the narrow-spiking class. This percentage was not
signiﬁcantly different from that detected in the cortex of wt
animals (8.4%; Fisher’s exact test P ¼ 0.36) and in line with
previous studies on mice of the same age12–15. These data show
that the deletion of miR-132/212 locus does not impinge on the
development of narrow-spiking units suggesting that the
disruption of binocular matching in null mice was not due to
an alteration of narrow-spiking inhibitory neurons. Consistently,
the analysis of binocular matching of orientation preference
exclusively in broad-spiking cells showed a signiﬁcant disruption
of this property in miR-132/212 mutants (t-test, Po0.01; Fig. 3h)
with no change in orientation selectivity (One-way ANOVA
P ¼ 0.165; Fig. 3i). These results also suggest that miR-132 could
be mainly involved in the maturation of response properties of
excitatory cortical neurons.
No OD plasticity and binocular matching in miR-132/212
mice. It has been reported that binocular matching of orientation
preference is an experience-dependent process19 sharing
molecular regulatory mechanisms with OD plasticity23. Thus,
we decided to investigate whether OD plasticity was blocked in
miR-132/212 null animals and whether the effects of MD on

Figure 3 | Binocular matching of orientation preference is impaired in miR-132/212 null mice. (a) Mutant mice (ko, N ¼ 6 mice, n ¼ 186 cells; ko-P60,
N ¼ 5 mice, n ¼ 85 cells) have a signiﬁcantly higher difference in preferred orientation (DO) with respect to wt animals both at P30 and P60 (wt, N ¼ 6

selectivity is observed in broad-spiking units. Asterisks indicate statistical signiﬁcance. Error bars represent s.e.m.

binocular matching could be occluded by miR-132/212 deletion.
Previous work had already shown that miR-132 is necessary for
OD plasticity9, however a temporally restricted block of miR-132
availability using a miR-132 sponge was adopted. Therefore, we
ﬁrst controlled whether OD plasticity was also blocked by our
genetic deletion of miR-132/212. We recorded visual evoked
potentials (VEPs) and single units in wt and null mice MD for 3
days from P24-25. VEP recordings showed that non-deprived
null mice have a normal OD ratio compared to age-matched wt
littermates (Two-way ANOVA on rank transformed data, post
hoc Holm-Sidak test P ¼ 0.566), and that three days of MD were
not able to induce OD shift in mutant mice (Two-way ANOVA
on rank transformed data, post hoc Holm-Sidak test P ¼ 0.958;
Fig. 4a). MD in wt animals led to a signiﬁcant decrease in the C/I
VEP ratio (Two-way ANOVA on rank transformed data,
genotype  condition interaction P ¼ 0.01; post hoc Holm-Sidak
test Po0.001).
Single-unit analysis of the ocular dominance index (ODI)
conﬁrmed the lack of OD plasticity in null mice. ODI of null mice
was not signiﬁcantly different from that of wt animals (Two-way
ANOVA, post hoc Holm-Sidak test P ¼ 0.210) and from that of
MD null mice (Two-way ANOVA, post hoc Holm-Sidak test
P ¼ 0.652), whereas MD wt mice displayed the typical OD shift
towards the open eye (Two-way ANOVA, genotype  condition

interaction Po0.05; post hoc Holm-Sidak test Po0.01; Fig. 4b).
Contralateral bias index (CBI) expressing the strength of
contralaterally driven responses for each animal conﬁrmed the
results of unit-based analysis (Two-way ANOVA, genotype 
condition interaction Po0.05; post hoc Holm-Sidak test: wt
versus ko P ¼ 0.96, ko versus ko-md P ¼ 0.97, wt versus wt-md
Po0.05; Supplementary Fig. 3A).
Then, we analysed the inﬂuence of visual experience on
binocular matching level in P27-28 miR-132/212 null and wt mice
subjected to a 3-days MD. We found that the effect of MD on
binocular matching was occluded by the deletion of miR-132/212:
while wt-md animals displayed a signiﬁcant impairment of
binocular matching with respect to non-deprived mice (Two-way
ANOVA, genotype  condition interaction Po0.05, post hoc
Holm-Sidak test Po0.001), the closure of one eye did not further
deteriorate the mismatch of orientation preference observed in
miR-132/212 null animals (post hoc Holm-Sidak test P ¼ 0.767;
Fig. 4c). The same conclusion emerged from the analysis of
binocular matching by case (Two-way ANOVA, genotype 
condition interaction Po0.01; post hoc Holm-Sidak test: wt
versus wt-md Po0.01, ko versus ko-md P ¼ 0.795,
Supplementary Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that miR132/212 is necessary for experience-dependent development of
binocular processes in the visual cortex.

Depth perception impairment in miR-132/212 null mice. We
then asked whether the disruption of binocular matching for
orientation preference caused by miR-132/212 deletion in the
visual cortex could affect animals’ perception abilities. We ﬁrst
performed an electrophysiological assessment of visual acuity
(VA) in P27-28 miR-132/212 null mice34. No VA difference was
present between mutant and wt animals (t-test, P ¼ 0.781;
Supplementary Fig. 4), conﬁrming that molecular mechanisms
underlying experience-dependent regulation of binocularity of
cortical neurons can be dissociated from those involved in VA
maturation and plasticity18,31,35–37.
We then focused on depth perception, given the importance of
binocular cues for this visual function. We employed the visual
cliff task to explore the effects of miR-132/212 deletion on
stereoscopic visual abilities. This test exploits the spontaneous
tendency of rodents to avoid the deep side of a visual cliff arena
(Fig. 5a). The construct validity of the visual cliff exploration test
was ﬁrst assessed investigating the behaviour of mice in
monocular condition (that is, subjected to the closure of one
eye obtained through eyelid suture). As previously reported38,
animals in binocular condition (bin) spent a longer period of time
on the shallow side of the arena, while monocular condition
(mon) led to a signiﬁcantly lower preference for the shallow side
(t-test, Po0.01; Fig. 5b). Total distance moved and velocity were
comparable between the two groups (t-test, P ¼ 0.123 and
P ¼ 0.142 respectively, Supplementary Fig. 5A,B). These results
conﬁrmed that binocular vision is required for discrimination
between the deep and the shallow side. To exclude the
contribution of non-visual cues to the preferential exploration
of the shallow side, we analysed the behaviour of binocular wt
animals in the same visual cliff arena with the two visual stimuli
placed at the same height immediately below the glass plates. In
this condition, the differential exploration of the two sides of the
arena shown by binocular wt mice in the visually cued version
was completely eliminated (t-test, Po0.01). Indeed, wt mice
equally explored the two sides of the arena (one-sample t-test
versus 50%; wt P ¼ 0.514, Fig. 5c). The same was true for miR132/212 null animals (one-sample t-test versus 50%; ko P ¼ 0.622,
Fig. 5c). These data demonstrate the tight relevance of visual cues
in visual cliff test. No difference was present between wt and
mutant mice in the time spent in the centre of the arena (t-test,
P ¼ 0.663, Fig. 5d) indicating similar levels of anxiety-like
behavior in the two genotypes.
Next, we evaluated depth perception abilities of miR-132/212
null mice. We found that miR-132/212 mutant mice showed a
6

signiﬁcantly reduced preference for the shallow side with respect
to wt mice (Kruskal–Wallis One-way ANOVA on ranks, post hoc
Dunn’s method, Po0.05; Fig. 5e, Supplementary Fig. 5C and
Supplementary Movies 1 and 2). Interestingly, the impairment in
stereoscopic abilities detected in miR-132/212 null mice was
reminiscent of that observed in animals subjected to a 3-day MD
and tested after the restoration of binocular vision (that is, 2 h
after the reopening of the deprived eye, wt-md; Kruskal–Wallis
One-way ANOVA on ranks, post hoc Dunn’s method, Fig. 5e,
Supplementary Fig. 5C). To rule out the possibility that the
signiﬁcant difference in visual capacities reﬂect changes in the
ability to cope with stress in challenging task conditions, we
analysed general activity and anxiety-related behaviour of wt and
miR-132/212 mutant mice in the visual cliff arena. We found that
total activity levels of animals were not affected by the deletion of
miR-132/212 (distance moved: t-test, P ¼ 0.285; velocity: t-test,
P ¼ 0.303; Fig. 5f,g). Moreover, the time spent by miR-132/212
mutant mice in the central portion of the apparatus was not
different from that recorded for wt animals (t-test, P ¼ 0.126,
Supplementary Fig. 5D), excluding the hypothesis that a
combination of abnormal anxiety and activity levels might be
related to their altered performance in the visual cliff arena.
In tight accordance with binocular matching results, depth
perception impairment in miR-132/212 null mice persisted in
adulthood: stereoscopic abilities of mutants at P60, indeed,
appeared markedly altered with respect to age-matched wt
animals (t-test, Po0.05; Fig. 5h, Supplementary Fig. 5E and
Supplementary Movies 3 and 4). Time spent in the central part of
the arena, total activity and velocity of animals were comparable
between genotypes also in this case (t-test, P ¼ 0.767, P ¼ 0.431
and P ¼ 0.349, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 5F, Fig. 5i,j).
These results demonstrate that disruption of the binocular
orientation tuning properties of neurons in the primary visual
cortex is associated with behavioural deﬁcits in depth perception.
Impaired binocular matching in Emx1:Cre-miR-132/212  /  mice.
Previous studies showed that miR-132 family is preferentially
expressed by excitatory cells39. Moreover, we found that miR-132/
212 deletion mainly affected the response properties of broadspiking cells (Fig. 3e) and morphological analysis of miR-132/212
null mice crossed with mice expressing green ﬂuorescent protein
in layer V pyramidal neurons showed a small but signiﬁcant
reduction spine density with respect to wt littermates (t-test,

excitatory cells could be a speciﬁc cellular target of miR-132
family. To directly investigate this possibility, we generated a
novel mouse model (Emx1:Cre-miR-132/212  /  ) in which
ﬂoxed miR-132/212 alleles are speciﬁcally deleted in forebrain
glutamatergic neurons and in some glial cells by using the Emx1
promoter to drive Cre-recombinase expression40. The
electrophysiological characterization of these mutants at P27-28
revealed no differences in monocular properties, with OSI, tuning
width and DSI being not signiﬁcantly different between
Emx1:Cre-miR-132/212  /  mice and their age-matched
littermates expressing exclusively the ﬂoxed miR-132/212 allele
(miR-132/212ﬂ/ﬂ mice) or the Cre-recombinase allele (Emx1:Crewt mice; One-way ANOVA, P ¼ 0.167, P ¼ 0.300 and P ¼ 0.893
respectively; Fig. 6c–e). In contrast, binocular orientation
matching appeared to be signiﬁcantly impaired in Emx1:CremiR-132/212  /  animals (One-way ANOVA Po0.01, post hoc
Holm-Sidak test Po0.01; Fig. 6f,g), thus recapitulating the
phenotype of ubiquitary null mice. Analysis of average binocular
matching of single mice conﬁrmed the presence of an impairment
exclusively in Emx1:Cre-miR-132/212  /  mice (One-way
ANOVA Po0.05, post hoc Holm-Sidak test, miR-132/212ﬂ/ﬂ
versus Emx1:Cre-miR-132/212  /  Po0.05; Emx1:Cre-wt

versus Emx1:Cre-miR-132/212  /  Po0.05; Emx1:Cre-wt
versus miR-132/212ﬂ/ﬂ P ¼ 0.808; Supplementary Fig. 7). These
data indicate that the action of miR-132 family in excitatory
forebrain cells is required for the normal development of
binocular matching of orientation preference in the primary
visual cortex.
Discussion
During the ﬁrst month of postnatal life the mouse visual cortex
undergoes dramatic morphological and functional changes that
leads to adult-like neuronal receptive ﬁelds17 and the maturation
of visual function18,41. We show that these changes are paralleled
by a considerable transcriptome rearrangement: many miRNAs
undergo a remarkable change of expression between P10 and P28
with the top hits being miR-29, that was previously involved in
regulating epigenetic enzymes important for cortical plasticity6;
miR-338 and miR-219, that were suggested to be key players in
myelination42,43; and miR-132/212, a miRNA family previously
involved in synaptic plasticity8–11,26,44–47. The combined analysis
of miRNAs and mRNAs in the visual cortex of wt and miR-132/
212 null mice revealed that genes downregulated with age and

upregulated by miR-132/212 deletion are highly enriched with
miR-132-3p targets and, to a much lesser extent, with targets of
miR-212-5p, the only two members of the miR-132 family
abundantly expressed in the visual cortex. Taken together, these
data demonstrate that miR-132 family contributes to shape the
developmental regulation of visual cortex transcriptome and
prompted us to analyse the effects of genetic deletion of the miR132/212 locus on functional development of the visual cortex. We
observed a speciﬁc deﬁcit in the maturation of binocular
matching of orientation preference in neurons of the binocular
visual cortex of mutants accompanied by a remarkable
impairment in depth perception.
OD plasticity is one the most studied models to understand
how experience regulates brain development. A ﬂurry of
molecular mediators have been shown to be regulated by visual
experience and involved in OD plasticity17,27. However, very little
is known about the role of molecular factors involved in OD
plasticity in normal visual development of non-deprived animals.
A reasonable expectation would be that in absence of these factors
visual development should be dramatically impaired. However,
many studies have shown that functional development of cortical
units is a multi-faceted process involving experience-independent
and experience-dependent aspects occurring at speciﬁc time
windows of development14,17,48. Thus, it is difﬁcult to predict
which features could be regulated by factors mediating
experience-dependent plasticity. Recent work showed that a late
8

occurring developmental process is the binocular matching of
orientation preference19–23. This process occurs in coincidence
with the rise of miR-132 expression in the visual cortex8, with
simple cells reaching adult levels of binocular matching of
orientation preference before complex cells23. Importantly, this
process is also temporally coincident with the CP for OD
plasticity and is disrupted by MD19 suggesting that mechanisms
underlying OD plasticity in deprived mice might overlap with
those involved in development of binocular matching of
orientation preference. Our data support this possibility by
showing that the absence of miR-132/212, that resulted in no OD
plasticity, was associated with a speciﬁc impairment of binocular
matching of orientation preference. By contrast, early developing
features of cortical neuron RF, like orientation and direction
selectivity, were unaffected. Moreover, the effects of MD on
binocular matching were occluded by miR-132/212 deletion
suggesting that MD might act on binocular matching by reducing
miR-132/212 levels. This hypothesis is based on previous data
showing that miR-132 and its primary precursor are strongly
downregulated by MD (refs 8,9). A possible scenario emerging
from these observations is that visual experience after eye opening
endows cortical cells with plasticity mechanisms, such as the posttranscriptional target regulation by miR-132/212, necessary for
reﬁnement of binocular connections onto visual cortical neurons.
These mechanisms would overlap with those involved in
changing OD in MD animals. MiR-132 family is expressed in

an activity-dependent manner also in the monocular visual
cortex8 therefore it seems unlikely that these miRNAs are
speciﬁcally dedicated to the formation of binocular cells. A
more likely possibility is that miR-132 family could be involved in
experience-dependent processes occurring also in this region14 at
the age when miR-132/212 is expressed.
Our data show that miR-132/212 mutants display an impaired
maturation of binocular depth perception revealed using the
visual cliff test that relies on binocular vision. This is the ﬁrst time
that an impairment of binocular matching of orientation
preference of cortical neurons has been related to a behavioural
failure, suggesting a physiological requirement of this neuronal
feature in mouse vision.
We can exclude the contribution of non-visual cues to the
preferential exploration of the shallow side because when we
placed visual stimuli at the same height immediately below the
glass plates, we did not detect any difference in the exploration of
the two sides of the apparatus. In addition, the effect reported was
not due to abnormal levels of anxiety or general exploratory
activity in mutant mice as indicated by the equal time spent in the
central and peripheral portion of the apparatus, and the
comparable path length and locomotion velocity shown by wt
and miR-132/212 null mice. Finally, the similar VA of wt and
mutant mice excludes the possibility that the different performance in the visual cliff test was due to blurring of the patterned
visual stimuli in mutants.
It is well-known that depth perception exploits multiple visual
cues, however binocular cues, such as disparity, are known to be
particularly important also in mice49. It has been proposed that
the response of visual cortical neurons to the inputs from the two
eyes need to be tuned to similar orientations to encode binocular
disparity of stimulus phase19,50, suggesting that impaired
matching of binocular orientation preference induced by miR132/212 deletion underlies the defective depth perception of
mutants.
Our data also show that the impairment of binocular matching
and depth perception due to miR-132/212 deletion is comparable
to that observed in MD wt mice. By contrast, OD of cortical
neurons is differentially affected by these two manipulations,
suggesting that depth perception preferentially reﬂects the state of
binocular interactions rather than the strength of the inputs of the
two eyes onto cortical neurons.
How could the transcriptional regulation of miR-132/212
cluster control experience-dependent development of functional
properties of visual cortical neurons? A series of in vitro and
in vivo studies revealed that miR-132 family has an active role in
brain structural plasticity. Indeed, miR-132 has been ﬂagged as an
important regulator of activity-dependent shaping of dendritic
morphology and arborization, and spine density8,46,51 acting
through the activation of the Pac1-PAK-actin remodelling
pathway47,52. Moreover, miR-132 was found to mediate
synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus53,54 and in the cortex26,
and alteration of its expression has been documented in several
neuropsychiatric disorders55,56. Most importantly, among the
miR-132 target genes downregulated with age in wt mice, but
remaining at signiﬁcant high levels in miR-132/212 null mice,
there are genes potentially involved in binocular matching like
MeCP2 (ref. 21), the mediator of brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) signalling Sos1 (ref. 23), and phosphatase and
tensin homolog (PTEN), an antagonist of the plasticity and
growth mTOR/Akt pathway30.
In conclusion, our study represents the ﬁrst characterization of
a miRNA role from its in vivo transcriptional and target
regulation to its moulding action on cortical receptive ﬁelds
and on its behavioural consequences on vision. Many microRNAs
were found to be strongly regulated with age suggesting that they

might contribute to the molecular regulation of the cortical
transcriptome and eventually to functional development. Their
number is likely to be underestimated by our study considering
that cell-speciﬁc analyses could reveal additional regulated
miRNA with highly selective expression. Thus, we surmise that
miRNAs likely represent a novel molecular layer of control of
postnatal cortical development. The pathogenetic relevance of
miR-132 regulated processes during development is further
supported by the presence of brain disease related genes among
the developmentally regulated miR-132 targets altered in the miR132/212 mutant including MeCP2 (ref. 57), Pten (ref. 58), Rasregulating genes Sos1 and Rasa1 (ref. 59), Mmp16 (ref. 60),
Runx1t1 (ref. 61), Sox11 (ref. 62), Sox5 (ref. 63) and Gpd2
(ref. 64). Since many neurodevelopmental disorders including
autism are related to alterations of neuronal connectivity and
synaptic plasticity, miR-132 dysregulation and subsequent
abnormal expression of miR-132 target genes could contribute
to some pathological traits present in these diseases. Thus, a
strategic modulation of miR-132/212 expression may offer a new
therapeutic approach for these severe disorders.
Methods
Animals. Mice were handled according to protocol approved by the Italian
Ministry of Health (Authorization number 147/2014-B) and commensurate with
NIH guidelines for the ethical treatment of animals. All mice (C57BL6J background
of both sexes) were kept in a normal 12 h light/dark cycle in a temperaturecontrolled room (20 °C) with ad libitum access to food and water ad libitum. Mice
with ubiquitary deletion of miR132/212 and wt littermates were used26. To target
miR132/212 deletion to excitatory neurons in the forebrain we used a mouse40
expressing Cre recombinase under the Emx1 promoter (Emx1:Cre). MiR132/
212 þ /ﬂ male mice26 were crossed with Emx1:Cre females to generate a mouse line
carrying the ﬂoxed miR132/212 and Emx1:Cre alleles. We used this speciﬁc
breeding strategy to avoid that undesired germ-line recombination could occur in
the Emx1-Cre testis, a tissue known to express Emx1 (ref. 65). Mice of three
genotypes were used as experimental animals: mice carrying the forebrain speciﬁc
deletion of miR-132/212 (Emx1:Cre-miR-132/212  /  ), mice expressing the ﬂoxed
allele but not Cre-recombinase (miR132/212ﬂ/ﬂ), and mice expressing Crerecombinase but not carrying the ﬂoxed allele (Emx1:Cre-miR-132/212 þ / þ ).
These genotypes were obtained in the same litter by crossing male miR132/212 þ /ﬂ
male mice with female Emx1:Cre-miR-132/212 þ /ﬂ females. Routine tail
genotyping of these mice was carried out using 3 primers resulting in bands of
373 bp for the wt allele, 420 for the ﬂoxed allele and 550 for the deleted allele26;
only mice in which germ-line recombination could be excluded because of the
presence of the 420 bp ﬂoxed band in the tail tissue were analysed.
RNA sequencing. RNA libraries were constructed from the samples extracted
from the 12 replicates in the three groups P10-wt, P28-wt and P28-KO using the
TruSeq RNA Sample preparation kit v2 (Illumina) and sequenced (2  100 bp
reads, about 30 M reads/sample) on a Illumina Hiseq2000 platform at the Istituto
di Genomica Applicata (Udine, Italy). The resulting sequencing data for each
library were post-processed to produce FastQ ﬁles, then demultiplexed using
Illumina software CASAVA 1.8.2. The number of sequencing reads obtained for
each replicate is reported in Supplementary Fig. 1. The quality of the sequences was
further assessed using the PHRED quality scores produced in real-time during the
base-calling stage of the sequencing run. The mean PHRED score by sequencing
cycle was computed separately for each group of replicates.
The reads from each replicate experiment were separately aligned to the
reference genome mm10 and corresponding transcriptome using the short-read
aligner ELAND v2e (Illumina). The RefSeq gene annotations were used to deﬁne
the set of known exons and splice junctions. Reads uniquely aligned to known
exons or splice junctions with no more than two mismatches within at least one
25 bp segment of the sequencing reads were included in the transcriptome. Reads
uniquely aligned but with more mismatches, or reads mapping several locations in
the reference genome, were ﬁltered out to use only unambiguously located reads in
the next steps of the RNA-seq analysis. Gene expression levels were directly
computed from the read alignment results for the 12 replicates in the groups P10WT, P28-WT and P28-KO. Standard RPKM values (reads per kilobase of exon
model per million mapped reads) were extracted for each gene covered by the
sequencing data and each replicate used in this study. Differential transcriptional
analyses were performed using CyberT (ref. 66), upgraded to handle RNA-seq
data67, across each pair of groups. A sliding window size of 101 genes and a
conﬁdence value of 10 were used as bayesian-regularization parameters across all
pair-wise comparisons. To correct for multiple comparisons and the multiple
hypothesis testing problem, we added the posterior probability of differential
expression that is computed from the distribution of the raw P values, by ﬁtting a

mixture of beta distributions to this distribution, and then computing the
probability that the observed P value belongs to the component in the mixture
associated with differentially expressed genes68. Genes of interest having a posterior
probability of differential expression above 0.6 are considered signiﬁcant.
Functional enrichment was performed for each of the differentially expressed gene
lists generated in the differential analysis. For KEGG pathway analysis of our gene
set data, we used the software GeneCodis (http://genecodis.cnb.csic.es/analysis).
MiRNA target prediction was performed using existing database scoring the
strength of the interaction (Target Scan Mouse 7.1). Genes with only poorly
conserved sites were not included.
Similar data were obtained using an alternative method to identify targets
combining three different sources:
(1) TargetScan: the ‘Broadly conserved’ category of data sets corresponding to
conservation among vertebrates was used. The conservation score used by
TargetScan is PCT.
(2) microRNA.org: targets were identiﬁed from target sites found by MiRanda
with a threshold miRSVR score (r  1.2). It is possible to identify non-conserved
sites in this database. However, since we take the intersection of sources, the site
was found to be conserved in either TargetScan or using BBLS.
(3) miRanda and BBLS: targets are identiﬁed from target sites which were found
by MiRanda and ﬁltered on a BBLSr1.0 from mm10.
To show if the miRNA target lists were found to be enriched in gene lists
deriving from P10-wt versus P28-wt, and P28-wt versus P28-KO comparisons we
analysed downregulated gene targets for those microRNA upregulated in the same
pair-wise comparisons as well as vice versa. Again, a Fisher exact test was used to
compute the statistical likelihood of enrichment for each microRNA’s target list.

In vivo electrophysiology. For surgery, mice were sedated with isoﬂurane
(Forane, 3%) followed by urethane (0.7 g kg  1, i.p., at 20% w/v in ringer). Dexamethasone (Soldesam, 2 mg kg  1) was administered subcutaneously to reduce
secretions and oedema. The animal was placed on a stereotaxic apparatus and
maintained at 37.5 °C by a feedback-controlled heating pad. The animal was also
ventilated through an oxygen mask. During surgery, eyes were protected by
appying a dexamethasone-based ointment (Tobradex, tobramycin 0.3% and
dexamethasone 0.1%), then with a thin layer of silicon oil. Local anaesthesia was
obtained with a subcutaneous injection of lidocaine (Angelini). After exposing the
skull, we performed a small craniotomy (2 mm in diameter) over the binocular
visual cortex (2.8–3.3 mm lateral and 0.1 mm anterior to lambda) living dura mater
intact. An electrode (2  2-tet-3 mm-150-150-121-A16-15, Neuronexus Technologies) was slowly lowered into the cortex to an appropriate depth to record local
ﬁeld potentials and single-unit activity and was allowed to settle for 30–40 min
before the beginning of recordings. The recording sites were located between layers
III and V, therefore the physiological data recorded mostly reﬂects the properties of
these layers. At the end of the experiment the animal was killed by overdose with of
urethane. Signals were acquired using 16 channels Neuralynx device and data
analysis was performed using a custom software written in Matlab. Visual stimuli
were generated in Matlab using the Psychophysics Toolbox extension and
displayed with gamma correction on a monitor (Sony Trinitron G500, 60 Hz
refresh rate, 32 cd m  2 mean luminance) placed 20 cm from the mouse,
subtending 60–75° of visual space.
Local ﬁeld potential- We measured the contralateral to ipsilateral ratio of VEPs
to measure OD plasticity. Extracellular signal was ﬁltered from 0.3 to 275 Hz and
sampled at 30.3 kHz. VEPs in response to square wave patterns with a spatial
frequency of 0.03 c/deg and abrupt phase inversion (1 Hz temporal period), were
evaluated in the time domain by measuring the P1 peak-to-baseline amplitude and
latency. We used computer controlled mechanical shutters to collect data from
each eye, reducing possible effects due to changes in behavioural states, and
adaptation. VA was assessed using different spatial frequencies (in 6 logarithmic
steps between 0.03 to 0.96 c/deg) in pseudorandom order. VA was obtained by
extrapolation to zero amplitude of the linear regression through the data points in a
curve where VEP amplitude is plotted against log spatial frequency. Baseline
response (0.96 c/deg) was subtracted from raw amplitude.
single-unit activity—for single-unit recording extracellular signal was ﬁltered
from 0.6 to 6 kHz. Sampling rate: 30.3 kHz. Spiking events were detected online by
voltage threshold crossing and waveforms of 1 ms were acquired around the time of
threshold crossing. To improve isolation of units, recordings from groups of four
neighbouring sites (tetrode) were linked, so that each spike was composed by 4
waveforms. Data were loaded on OffLine Sorter software (Plexon) and principal
component analysis was performed to score spikes with an high degree of similarity
in a 3D feature space, where dimensions correspond to the ﬁrst 3 principal
components. Waveforms from each electrode of the tetrodes were processed
together to improve isolation. Clusters were progressively deﬁned using convex
hulls and then recalculating principal component analysis. Quality of separation
was determined based on the following criteria: (1) during manual clusterization
with convex hulls, raw waveforms in the clusters were visually inspected to check
the uniformity of single waveforms; (2) clusters contained o0.1% of spikes within
a 1.0 ms interspike interval; (3) auto- and cross-correlograms of the clusters were
also inspected to reveal if the cluster contained more than a single unit or if several
clusters contained spikes of the same unit; (4) the peak amplitude of a unit
remained stable over the entire recording session. Units were included in the
10

sample for analysis of tuning properties when they had an average peak ﬁring rate,
across trials of the optimal stimulus for the dominant eye, of 40.5 Hz.
Drifting sinusoidal gratings were used as visual stimuli (1.5 s duration, temporal
frequency of 2 Hz, 12 different orientations with a step of 30°, 6 spatial frequency:
0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.16 and 0.32 cpd). Stimulation was repeated ﬁve times per
eye, with stimulus conditions randomly interleaved, and two grey blank conditions
(mean luminance) were included in all stimulus sets to estimate the spontaneous
ﬁring rate. The average spontaneous rate for each unit was calculated by averaging
the rate over all blank condition presentations. Responses at each orientation and
spatial frequency were calculated by averaging the spike rate during the 1.5 s
presentation and subtracting the spontaneous rate. The preferred stimulus was
determined ﬁnding the combination of spatial frequency and orientation that
maximize the response, independently for each eye. Orientation tuning curves were
constructed for the spatial frequency that gave maximal response at this
orientation. Given this ﬁxed preferred orientation (OPref), the tuning curve was
ﬁtted as the sum of two Gaussians centred on OPref and OPref þ p, of different
amplitudes but equal width, with a constant baseline B. From this ﬁt, we calculated
two metrics: an OSI representing the ratio of the tuned versus untuned component
of the response, and the width of the tuned component. OSI was calculated as
follows: (respOPref-respOOrtho)/(respOPref þ respOOrtho), where resp is the
maximal response evoked by visual stimulation and OOrtho is the orientation
orthogonal to the preferred one. Tuning width is the half-width at half-maximum
of the principal gaussian. In addition, DSI was calculated as: (respOPrefrespOOppo)/(respPref þ respOppo). The difference in preferred orientation
between the two eyes (binocular matching, DO) was calculated by subtracting
ipsilateralOPref from contralateral OPref along the 180° cycle. ODI was calculated
as follows: ODI ¼ (respContra-respIpsi)/(respContra þ respIpsi), Contra is the
contralateral eye and ipsi is the ipsilateral eye. Simple and complex units were
classiﬁed using mtspectrumpb from chronux toolbox69. Linearity of response was
calculated at the orientation and spatial frequency that gave maximal response. We
binned the 1.5 s presentation into a poststimulus time histogram at 100 ms intervals
and subtracted the spontaneous rate. We then applied the discrete Fourier
transform and computed F1/F0, the ratio of the ﬁrst harmonic (response at the
drift frequency) to the 0th harmonic (mean response). Units were then classiﬁed as
narrow or broad spiking on the basis of properties of their average waveforms. The
parameters used for discrimination were: the height of the positive peak relative to
the initial negative trough, the time from the minimum of the initial trough to
maximum of the following peak, and the slope of the waveform 0.5 ms after the
initial trough. Two linearly separable clusters were found, corresponding to
narrow-spiking (putative inhibitory) and broad-spiking (putative excitatory)
neurons. These clusters were separated identically by both k-means and linkage
clustering.
Visual cliff test. A modiﬁcation of the published visual cliff38 was employed. The
apparatus consisted of a rectangular arena (50  36 cm) constructed in
poly(vinylchloride) with white walls and bordered by black curtains to prevent the
animal’s escape. The arena was divided into two 25  36 cm Plexiglas plates. A
moving platform, the depth of which could be varied by means of a mechanical
scissor jack, was placed below each glass plate. A patterned ﬂoor consisting in 3-cm
black and white checked photographic paper covered the platform’s surface
(Fig. 5a). Incandescent lamps placed below the two patterned ﬂoors illuminate both
surfaces to equate the brightness of the two sides. A telecamera was hanging on the
apparatus and was connected to a computer by which the experimenter could
observe and record the animal’s behaviour. Testing took place in a quiet room. The
arena was divided into a shallow and a deep side. At the shallow side the patterned
ﬂoor was positioned immediately below the glass plate, while at the deep side the
checked platform was moved to 29 cm below the glass plate. Each animal was
placed on the shallow side and the total time the mouse spent exploring each side
of the arena was recorded. The trial ended after 5 min. The position of the shallow
and the deep side of the arena was randomized between animals. The exploration
path and velocity of each animal were recorded and analysed with the Noldus
Ethovision system. The arena was cleaned between trials with a 10% alcohol
solution. To rule out that non-visual cues could affect the output of the task, we
also assessed animal behaviour in the absence of visual cues, with visual stimuli
placed immediately below the glass plates of the apparatus.
Spine density assessment. To study spine density, miR-132/212 transgenic and
wt mice crossed with the mouse line expressing green ﬂuorescent protein in layer V
pyramidal neurons (line M (ref. 70)) were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and
brains were post-ﬁxed for 2 hours and incubated in 30% sucrose in PBS O/N.
Coronal sections (200 mm) were cut on a vibratome. Slices were mounted on glass
slides and stacks of images were acquired by using a Zeiss ApoTome microscope.
A low magniﬁcation image was ﬁrst acquired to guide the experimenter to acquire
a high magniﬁcation image in V1 based on anatomical points of reference. Spines
were manually counted using ImageJ.
Data availability. The sequences generated and analysed during the current study
are available in the GEO repository (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/
