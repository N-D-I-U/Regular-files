CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein) is an important
transcription factor for the activation of a number of immediate
early genes. CREB is phosphorylated on Ser133 by PKA (protein
kinase A), promoting the recruitment of the co-activator proteins
CBP (CREB-binding protein) and p300; this has been proposed
to increase the transcription of CREB-dependent genes. CREB is
also phosphorylated on Ser133 by MSK1/2 (mitogen- and stressactivated kinase 1/2) in cells in response to the activation of
MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signalling; however,
the relevance of this to gene transcription has been controversial.
To resolve this problem, we created a mouse with a Ser133 to
alanine residue mutation in the endogenous Creb gene. Unlike the
total CREB knockout, which is perinatally lethal, these mice were
viable, but born at less than the expected Mendelian frequency
on a C57Bl/6 background. Using embryonic fibroblasts from the

S133A-knockin mice we show in the present study that Ser133
phosphorylation downstream of PKA is required for CBP/p300
recruitment. The requirement of Ser133 phosphorylation for
the PKA-mediated induction of CREB-dependent genes was,
however, promoter-specific. Furthermore, we show that in cells
the phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 by MSKs does not
promote strong recruitment of CBP or p300. Despite this, MSKmediated CREB phosphorylation is critical for the induction of
CREB-dependent genes downstream of MAPK signalling.

INTRODUCTION

all been suggested to phosphorylate CREB on Ser133 in cells [13–
17].
The phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 by PKA creates a
binding site for the KIX domain of the co-activator proteins
CBP (CREB-binding protein) and/or p300 [18–20]. Both CBP
and p300 possess acetylase activity and are able to stimulate
transcription of the promoters to which they are recruited
[21]. This gave rise to a model in which PKA-phosphorylated
CREB bound to CRE sites in CREB-dependent genes, leading
to CBP/p300 recruitment to these promoters. CBP and p300,
via their acetylase activity, would then be able to activate
transcription. More recently this model has been modified
following the discovery of another group of CREB co-activators,
the CRTCs (CREB-regulated transcription co-activator) [22].
These proteins can be recruited to CREB independently of
Ser133 phosphorylation. CRTCs are also regulated via PKA; in
unstimulated cells CRTCs are retained in the cytoplasm and the
activation of PKA promotes their nuclear translocation [22–24].
Although the phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 has been
considered as the classical mechanism by which CREB is
activated, it is not clear whether phosphorylation of Ser133 itself is
sufficient for maximal CREB activation in vivo. In particular,
it has been proposed that, although PKA-mediated CREB
phosphorylation promotes CREB-dependent gene transcription,
CREB phosphorylation of Ser133 downstream of MAPK (mitogenactivated protein kinase) signalling is not sufficient to promote

The induction of IE (immediate early) genes plays an important
role in the cellular response to many signals. CREB (cAMPresponse-element-binding protein) is a bZIP (basic leucine
zipper) transcription factor, which regulates the expression of
many IE genes by binding to the CRE (cAMP-responsive
element) present in their promoter regions [1]. Genome-wide
studies have shown that CREB can bind to hundreds of gene
promoters [2,3], giving CREB the ability to affect many cellular
functions. Consequently, roles for CREB have been found in many
physiological process, ranging from development, metabolic
regulation, neuronal function to innate immunity (reviewed in
[4–8]). How the transcriptional activity of CREB is regulated
has been the subject of extensive investigation; however, a
complete picture of the molecular events controlling CREB is
still lacking. Initial studies have suggested phosphorylation to
be the primary mechanism by which CREB was controlled [1].
CREB was found to be phosphorylated on Ser133 by PKA (protein
kinase A), a kinase activated by cAMP in cells [9,10]. Since
then, a wide variety of cellular stimuli have been shown to
promote CREB phosphorylation, and several additional kinases
have been proposed (reviewed in [1,11,12]). For example, MSK1
(mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1) and MSK2, CaMK
(Ca2 + /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) family members,
PKD (protein kinase D) and RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase) have

CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 regulates transcription via distinct
mechanisms downstream of cAMP and MAPK signalling

the induction of CREB-dependent genes [1]. Early studies
revealed that stimulation of the TCR (T-cell receptor) in Jurkat
cells resulted in a strong phosphorylation of CREB, but that
this did not stimulate CREB-dependent transcription [25]. TCR
stimulation promotes the phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 via
the ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) and p38
MAPK pathways. ERK1/2 and p38 do not directly phosphorylate
CREB, but instead activate the CREB kinases MSK1 and MSK2
[26]. Double-knockout of MSK1/2 blocks TCR-induced CREB
phosphorylation in primary T-cells; however, in line with the
earlier study on CREB in Jurkat cells, MSK1/2 knockout did not
affect the ability of TCR activation to promote the transcription of
classical CREB-dependent genes such as c-Fos and Nur77 [26].
Stimuli such as forskolin or PMA that selectively activate either
PKA or ERK1/2 respectively can both induce similar levels of
CREB phosphorylation in cells. Intriguingly, using FRET-based
reporters it has been found that in cells the phosphorylation of
Ser133 in CREB by PKA is much more effective at promoting the
interaction between CREB and CBP than Ser133 phosphorylation
downstream of MAPKs [27]. Similarly, MEFs (mouse embryonic
fibroblasts) with a deletion of both CBP and p300 result in either
little change or even increased transcription of several CREBdependent genes in response to stimulation with serum [28], a
strong activator of ERK1/2. Together this would suggest that the
phosphorylation of CREB downstream of MAPKs might not play
a role in regulating IE gene transcription. Other data, however,
argue against this hypothesis. Although the knockout of the CREB
kinases MSK1 and MSK2 does not affect gene induction in T-cells
[26], this is not the case in other cell types. For example, double
knockout of MSK1 and MSK2 prevents CREB phosphorylation
in response to PMA and anisomycin in MEFs [13] and in addition
MSK1/2 knockout also reduced the induction of several CREBdependent genes in response to PMA or anisomycin in these cells
[29]. Similar results have also been found following BDNF (brainderived neurotrophic factor) stimulation of cortical neurons and
LPS (lipopolysaccharide) or zymosan stimulation of macrophages
[30–32]. Although these findings are consistent with a role
for MSK-mediated CREB phosphorylation in gene induction it
remains possible that in reality MSKs control the induction of
IE genes via the phosphorylation of substrates other than CREB.
For example, MSKs also phosphorylate histone H3 on Ser10 and
Ser28 [29,33] and it is therefore possible that MSKs regulate gene
induction via directly regulating chromatin structure [34]. Other
substrates have also been proposed for MSKs, including Ser276
in the RelA NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) subunit. Both NF-κB
and CRE sites have been identified in the Il6 (interleukin 6)
promoter; however, it has been proposed that in MEFs MSKs
regulate IL-6 transcription via the phosphorylation of the RelA
NF-κB subunit and not CREB [35]. Thus it is not clear what role,
if any, MSK-mediated CREB phosphorylation plays in regulating
gene induction. To resolve this we created a knockin mutation of
Ser133 to alanine in the endogenous Creb gene in mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice

Mice with a double knockout of both MSK1 and MSK2 have been
described previously [13]. A conditional knockin allele of S133A
in CREB has been described previously [36], and to convert
this into a constitutive knockin these mice were crossed to a
germline expressing Cre transgenic line. Following generation of
the constitutive knockin allele, mice were crossed away from the
Cre transgene. Unless otherwise stated, both MSK1/2 knockout
and CREB S133A mice were backcrossed on to C57Bl/6 mice for

a minimum of nine generations before isolation of MEFs. Mice
were housed in accordance with U.K. and EU (European Union)
regulations and animal work was approved by local ethical review
and carried out under an appropriate U.K. Home Office project
license.
Cell culture

Primary MEFs were cultured as described [13]. Briefly,
day 13.5 embryos were dissected and the head and
internal organs removed. The remaining tissue was diced
and digested with trypsin. Cells were then centrifuged, resuspended and plated in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium)
supplemented with 10 % FBS (Sigma), 2 mM L-glutamine,
100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were
grown for up to five passages. The GloResponse CRE-luc2P
HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cell line, which expresses
a stably incorporated CREB-dependent luciferase gene, were
obtained from Promega and maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10 % FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G,
100 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 μg/ml hygromycin B.
Immunoblotting

Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer and run on 10 %
polyacrylamide gels, and transferred on to nitrocellulose
membranes using standard techniques. Antibodies used against
phospho-Ser133 CREB [which also recognizes ATF1 (activating
transcription factor 1) phosphorylated on Ser63 ], phosphoERK1/2, phospho-p38, total CREB, total ERK1/2, total p38α,
GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and total
CRTC2 were from Cell Signaling Technology and total CRTC3
was from Abcam. For quantification of total CREB levels, samples
were run on a single gel and blotted for CREB and GAPDH.
Membranes were imaged using a CCD (charge-coupled-device)
camera and quantified using Aida software.
qPCR (quantitative real-time PCR)

Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy Micro kit according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA (0.5–1 μg) was reverse
transcribed using iScript (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and qPCR
was carried out using SYBR Green-based detection methods
(Bio-Rad Laboratories). GAPDH and/or 18S were used as a
loading control and fold change was calculated relative to the
unstimulated wild-type sample as described previously [41].
Primer sequences are given in Supplementary Table S1 (at
http://www.biochemj.org/bj/458/bj4580469add.htm).
Luciferase assays

Cells were serum starved for 16 h prior to stimulation with
400 ng/ml PMA or 20 μM forskolin for 4 h. Luciferase activities
were measured by using the dual luciferase assay system
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
ChIP assay

MEFs were stimulated as indicated in the Figure legends.
Cells were then incubated in 1 % formaldehyde in serumfree medium for 10 min at room temperature (20 ◦ C). Crosslinking was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final
concentration of 125 mM followed by a further 5 min incubation

at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS,
detached by scraping and then pelleted by centrifugation at 2403 g
for 10 min at 4 ◦ C. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 1 % SDS,
10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml
leupeptin and 1 μg/ml aprotinin for 10 min on ice. Chromatin
was sheared to an average length of 200–800 bp by nine 15 s
bursts of sonication at 4 ◦ C using a VibraCell (Sonics) sonicator
at 50 % power. Samples were centrifuged at 13845 g for 10 min at
4 ◦ C and the soluble chromatin fraction was retained. Fragmented
chromatin was then diluted 1:10 in dilution buffer (1 % Triton X100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.1)
before preclearing with Protein G–Sepharose beads (Generon)
and 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen) for 2 h at 4 ◦ C. At this
stage 10 % of the sample was retained for use as an input control.
Chromatin fractions were then incubated with 2 μg of antibody
with the addition of BRIJ-35 (Merck Biosciences) detergent to
a final concentration of 0.1 % overnight at 4 ◦ C. The antibodies
used against CBP and p300 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
against total CREB and phospho-CREB/ATF1 were from Cell
Signaling Technology and the anti-CRTC3 antibody was raised
in-house. Mouse IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) and acetyl
histone H3 (Millipore) were used as negative and positive controls
respectively. To isolate the immunocomplexes, 60 μl of Protein
G–Sepharose beads was added to the samples for 1 h at 4 ◦ C.
Beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed once in lowsalt buffer (0.1 % SDS, 1 % Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM
NaCl and 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0), once in high-salt buffer
(0.1 % SDS, 1 % Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl and
20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0), once in 250 mM LiCl, 1 % Nonidet
P40, 1 % deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA and 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH
8.0 and twice in TE buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mM
EDTA). Immunoprecipitated material was eluted in 1 % SDS plus
100 mM NaHCO3 and cross-linking was reversed by the addition
of NaCl to a final concentration of 300 mM followed by incubation
at 65 ◦ C overnight. Protein was eliminated by treating the samples
with Proteinase K (Qiagen) for 1 h at 45 ◦ C and DNA was then
purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Purified immunoprecipitated DNA
and input DNA were analysed using the SYBR Green-based qPCR
method. The primers were designed in promoter regions covering
the CRE site (see Supplementary Table S1). The qPCR data
were analysed using the Percentage Input {100 × 2[Input(Ct )−IP(Ct )]}
method.
RESULTS
Generation of CREB Ser133 knockin mouse model

We have previously used gene targeting to create a conditional
S133A mutant in the endogenous CREB allele [36]. This was
converted into a constitutive S133A mutation by crossing these
mice to a Cre recombinase line that deletes in the germline. The
resulting constitutive knockin allele was then bred away from
the Cre transgene and backcrossed against either C57Bl/6 or CD1
mice for at least six generations. In contrast with CREB-knockout
mice, which die shortly after birth [37], live CREB S133A knockin
mice were obtained. These mice did not exhibit any apparent
adverse welfare effects when maintained under specific pathogenfree conditions, and were fertile. On a C57/Bl6 background
the homozygous S133A mice were not obtained at Mendelian
frequencies (wild-type 27 %, heterozygous 61.4 % and knockin
11.6 %, n = 293 for matings of heterozygous parents), suggesting
that some of the knockins were dying in utero. When crossed on
to a CD1 outbred background this effect was not observed and the
S133A knockin mice were obtained at the expected ratio (wild-

471

type 26.2 %, heterozygous 51 % and knockin 22.8 %, n = 149
for matings of heterozygous parents).
To examine the effects of the knockin at a cellular level
we generated MEFs from wild-type and CREB S133A E13.5
(embryonic day 13.5) embryos. Immunoblotting of lysates from
these cells indicated that the expression of CREB was similar
in wild-type and CREB S133A knockin cells (Figure 1A). In
CREB knockouts, a compensatory increase in the expression
of other CREB family members has been reported [37–39].
The expression of CREB, ATF1 and CREM (cAMP-responsive
element modulator) mRNA in the CREB S133A knockin
MEFs, however, was similar to that seen in wild-type cells
(Figure 1B). No consistent difference was seen in the levels of
CREB protein between wild-type and CREB S133A MEFs, as
determined by immunoblotting (Figure 1C). The stimulation of
wild-type cells with forskolin, which activates PKA, promoted
the phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 (Figure 1A). As would
be expected, no CREB Ser133 phosphorylation was detected in
the CREB S133A knockin cells. The phosphorylation of ATF1
on the analogous site to Ser133 in CREB is also detected by
the anti-phospho-CREB antibody and ATF1 phosphorylation
was induced to similar levels in wild-type and CREB S133A
knockin cells (Figure 1A). Forskolin stimulation also decreased
the phosphorylation of the CREB co-activators CRTC2 and
CRTC3, as judged by a downwards bandshift on immunoblots.
This has been reported previously and correlates with the
dephosphorylation of key 14-3-3-binding sites and the nuclear
translocation of CRTC2 and CRTC3 [22–24].
As the phosphorylation of Ser133 by PKA has been proposed as
a key event in the activation of CREB-dependent transcription,
we examined the effect of the knockin mutation on forskolininduced transcription. Areg, Nur77 (NR4A1), Nurr1 (NR4A2),
Nor1 (NR4A3), Dusp1 (dual-specificity phosphatase 1) (Mkp1),
JunB and ICER (inducible cAMP early repressor) have all been
previously shown to be CREB-regulated genes in MEFs costimulated with forskolin and IBMX (isobutylmethylxanthine)
[40,41]. IL-6 transcription has also been linked to CREB
and has been shown to be regulated in MEFs by MSKs,
kinases that can phosphorylate CREB on Ser133 [35,41]. In
line with previous studies, the mRNA levels of these genes
were induced by forskolin in wild-type MEFs; however,
only some of these genes were affected by the CREB
S133A knockin (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S1A
at http://www.biochemj.org/bj/458/bj4580469add.htm). Of these,
Areg was the most strongly inhibited by the CREB S133A
knockin, followed by IL-6 and then Nur77 and Nor1, whose
transcription was inhibited by approximately 50 % (Figure 2A).
The transcription of Nurr1, DUSP1 and JunB was not significantly
reduced by the knockin mutation (P > 0.05, Figure 2A and
Supplementary Figure 1A). A small, but statistically significant,
increase was seen in the induction of ICER mRNA in the
CREB S133A knockin macrophages relative to wild-type
controls.
The phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 creates a binding site
for the CBP/p300 co-activator proteins. ChIP assays were used to
determine whether the knockin mutation affects the recruitment
of CBP or p300 to CREB at the promoters of CREB-dependent
genes. Primers were designed for the Nur77, Nor1, Nurr1, ICER
and Il6 promoter region containing the CRE site. In response
to forskolin, recruitment of CBP or p300 could be seen to the
promoters of Nur77, Nor1, Il6 and ICER, but not to the promoter of the Gapdh gene (Figure 2B). Some recruitment was
also seen to the Nurr1 promoter; however, this was not induced
as strongly as for the other CREB-dependent genes tested. The
CREB S133A knockin mutation greatly decreased the recruitment

Mutation of Ser133 in the endogenous Creb gene does not result in a compensatory up-regulation of CREB family members

(A) MEFs were isolated from wild-type and CREB S133A knockin mice. Cells were serum starved for 16 h and then stimulated for the indicated times with 20 μM forskolin. Following lysis the levels
of the indicated proteins were determined by immunoblotting. Both CREB and ATF1 possess a conserved phosphorylation site that is recognized by the same antibody. (B) Wild-type, heterozygous
or CREB S133A knockin MEFs were serum starved for 16 h and then stimulated for 30 min with 20 μM forskolin. Total RNA was then isolated and the levels of CREB, CREM and ATF1 mRNA were
determined by qPCR. Error bars are +
−S.D. of three independent stimulations on two different preparations of MEFs per genotype. (C) Samples from three independent preparations of wild-type
or CREB S133A knockin MEFs were immunoblotted for GAPDH and CREB. The ratio of CREB to GAPDH was determined as detailed in the Materials and methods section and the average +

(n = 3) is shown.

of CBP and p300 to the Nor1 and Il6 promoters (Figure 2B). The
recruitment of CBP to the Nur77 promoter was also decreased,
although not to the same extent as for Nor1 and IL-6. For the
Nurr1 and ICER promoters, the CREB S133A mutation had little
or no effect on CBP and p300 levels (Figure 2B).
In order to confirm that CREB is recruited to these promoters
we also carried out ChIP with anti-total-CREB and anti-phosphoCREB/ATF1 antibodies. CREB was found to be constitutively
bound to the Nor1, Nurr1, ICER and Il6 promoters, and the levels
of CREB at these promoters were not affected by the knockin
mutation in unstimulated cells. CREB levels on the Nur77
promoter in unstimulated cells were low, but increased by
forskolin treatment in wild-type, but not CREB S133A knockin,
cells. The ChIP signal with the anti-phospho-CREB/ATF1
antibody in unstimulated cells at the five genes tested was
similar to that seen with the control antibody, consistent with the
low levels of phospho-CREB seen in immunoblotting. However,
forskolin stimulation increased the phospho-CREB/ATF1 ChIP
signal at the Nor1, Nur77, Nurr1, ICER and Il6 promoters. This
signal was reduced, but not completely abolished, by the mutation

c The Authors Journal compilation 

of Ser133 in CREB. This reduction was least apparent at the
Nurr1 and ICER promoters, which were the two genes whose
induction was least affected by the S133A knockin. This could
reflect the presence of phosphorylated ATF1 on these promoters.
It should also be noted that the phospho-CREB ChIP would not
distinguish between an increased recruitment of phosphorylated
CREB to a promoter or an increased phosphorylation of CREB
that was already constitutively bound to a promoter. The CREB
co-activator CRTC3 was also found to be recruited to the
promoters of the CREB-dependent genes tested in response to
forskolin (Figure 3), in line with its dephosphorylation which
would promote its nuclear translocation (Figure 1). On the Nor1,
Nur77 and Il6 promoters, CRTC3 recruitment in response to
forskolin was reduced by the CREB S133A knockin. In contrast,
the CREB knockin mutation did not affect CRTC3 recruitment to
Nurr1 or ICER, an observation that correlated with the presence
of phospho-CREB/ATF1 ChIP signal at these promoters.
The above results support a model in which the phosphorylation
of CREB on Ser133 in cells creates a binding site for CBP
or p300, and thus increases transcription at target promoters.

The importance of this phosphorylation for the transcription of
endogenous CREB-dependent genes is, however, dependent on
the specific promoter analysed.

CREB Ser133 phosphorylation is important for the induction of IE
genes downstream of MAPK signalling

As discussed above, it has been suggested that the phosphorylation
of CREB downstream of MAPKs does not lead to CBP or
p300 recruitment and does not stimulate the induction of CREBdependent reporter genes. Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells stably expressing a CREB-dependent luciferase reporter
gene. The stimulation of these cells with forskolin resulted in
the induction of the CREB-dependent reporter gene, whereas
PMA, which is a strong agonist for the ERK1/2 pathway, did

not (Figure 4A). In addition to the phosphorylation of CREB
on Ser133 , PKA also promotes the dephosphorylation of CRTC2
and CRTC3 as shown using SDS/PAGE with a band shift in the
forskolin-stimulated cell lysates (Figure 1). The dephosphorylated
CRTCs are then translocated to the nucleus [23]. In contrast,
ERK1/2 activation does not promote CRTC dephosphorylation
(Figure 4B). This is in line with previous studies which found
that the activation of MAPKs was insufficient to promote the
nuclear localization of CRTCs [24]. These results confirm that
the phosphorylation of CREB downstream of MAPK signalling
is unable to induce the transcription of CREB-dependent reporter
genes. However, it is not clear whether this is also the case
for the induction of endogenous genes. Therefore we tested the
effect of the CREB S133A knockin mutation on gene induction
downstream of MAPK signalling. Both the ERK1/2 and p38
MAPK cascades are able to induce the phosphorylation of CREB

Effect of forskolin on CREB and CRTC levels at CREB-dependent promoters

MEFs from wild-type or CREB S133A knockin MEFs were serum starved for 16 h and then stimulated for 30 min with 20 μM forskolin. ChIP was then carried out as described in the methods using
antibodies against total CREB (t-CREB), phospho-CREB/ATF1, total CRTC3 (t-CRTC3) or a control IgG (control Ab). Error bars are +
−S.D. of independent stimulations on four preparations of MEFs

via the activation of MSK1 and MSK2. We have previously
shown that in MEFs PMA activates MSKs predominately
via ERK1/2, whereas anisomycin acts predominately via p38
[13]. TNF (tumour necrosis factor) activates both ERK1/2 and
p38 in MEFs and both MAPK pathways contribute to MSK
activation and CREB phosphorylation downstream of TNF [42].
As expected, PMA, anisomycin and TNF all induced CREB Ser133
phosphorylation in wild-type, but not CREB S133A knockin,
MEFs. The phosphorylation of ATF1 and the activation of ERK1/2
and p38 (as judged by phosphorylation of their activation loops)
was unaffected by the knockin mutation (Figures 4B–4D). Similar
to forskolin stimulation, PMA induced the transcription of Areg,
Nur77, Nurr1, Nor1, Il6 and ICER in wild-type MEFs. The
induction of all of these genes was greatly decreased in CREB
S133A knockin cells relative to wild-type cells (Figure 5A). This
was not due to a general deficit in transcription, as the CREBindependent gene c-Jun was unaffected by the S133A knockin
(Figure 5B). The induction of Egr1, a gene we have previously


found not to be reduced by knockout of the CREB kinases MSK1
and MSK2 [13], was slightly decreased by the CREB S133A
knockin in this experiment. Similar results were obtained for the
induction of CREB-dependent genes by anisomycin, although the
effect of the knockin mutation on Nur77 transcription was not as
great as seen for PMA (Figure 5C). The CREB knockin mutation
did not reduce the induction of the CREB-independent genes
Egr1 and NFKBIA [IκBα (inhibitor of NF-κBα)] by anisomycin
(Figure 5D). Compared with PMA and anisomycin, TNF was
a weaker stimulus for the induction of the genes tested. The
CREB S133A knockin mutation greatly decreased the induction
of CREB-dependent, but only small changes were seen in CREBindependent, genes (Figures 5E and 5F).
Given these results, we tested the ability of PMA to promote
CBP or p300 recruitment to CREB-dependent IE gene promoters.
As measured by ChIP, PMA induced little or no detectable
recruitment of either CBP or p300 to the Nurr1, Nor 1, Il6 or ICER
promoters (Figure 6), although in the same experiments forskolin

did induce CBP and p300 recruitment. Some recruitment was
observed at the Nur77 promoter in response to PMA; however,
this was less than that obtained in response to forskolin (Figure 6).

DISCUSSION

To examine the role of Ser133 phosphorylation in regulating the
transcriptional activation of CREB, we generated a knockin
mutation of this site in the endogenous Creb gene. Previous
studies on CREB knockouts have reported that compensation
from the related proteins CREM and ATF1 can occur in
the absence of the CREB protein [37–39]. The possibility of
compensation from other CREB family member is perhaps less
likely in the CREB S133A knockin mice, as CREB is expressed
at its normal levels and should still able to bind to CRE sites in
gene promoters. In MEFs, we did not observe any up-regulation
of ATF1 phosphorylation and the expression of both the ATF1
and CREM mRNAs was normal. Despite this, the phenotype
of the CREB S133A mice generated in the present study was
arguably less severe than that previously reported for total CREB
knockout [37]. Unlike the perinatal lethality seen in the knockout,
those CREB S133A mice that were born had no apparent
adverse phenotype when maintained under specific pathogenfree conditions. This is consistent with the idea that not all
CREB functions are dependent on Ser133 phosphorylation. In the
present study we show that, although CREB phosphorylation is

required to promote the transcription of specific CREB-dependent
IE genes, this requirement is both promoter- and stimulispecific. Therefore not all CREB regulated genes require Ser133
phosphorylation, whereas for those that do, this requirement is
not necessarily seen downstream of all CREB-activating stimuli.
The molecular mechanism of CREB regulation has been
most studied in the context of cAMP signalling. Two important
mechanisms of CREB regulation have emerged downstream
of cAMP signalling; CREB Ser133 phosphorylation leading to
CBP/p300 recruitment, and the relocalization of CRTCs to
the nucleus where they bind CREB independently of Ser133
phosphorylation. Both of these events can be regulated by the
cAMP-dependent kinase PKA. PKA directly phosphorylates
CREB on Ser133 [10]. Two genetic models have been used to study
the role of CBP/p300 in forskolin-induced gene transcription
in MEFs [40,41]. In the first model, a point mutation was
introduced into the KIX domains of both CBP and p300 in
order to block their binding to phosphorylated CREB [40].
This mutation would also prevent the recruitment of CBP and
p300 to CREM and ATF1 phosphorylated on the analogous
site to Ser133 in CREB. Xu et al. [40] found that blocking the
ability of CBP and p300 to bind to CREB reduced the ability
of forskolin to induce some CREB-dependent genes, but not
others. The importance of CREB family members to the forskolininduced transcription of the genes tested has been confirmed in
MEFs by transfection of A-CREB, a dominant-negative form of
CREB that prevents the binding of CREB, ATF1 and CREM

Effect of CREB S133A knockin on IE gene induction downstream of MAPK signalling

Wild-type or CREB S133A knockin MEFs were serum starved for 16 h and then stimulated for the indicated times with either 400 ng/ml PMA (A and B), 10 μg/ml anisomycin (C and D) or 10 ng/ml
TNF (E and F) for the indicated times. The induction of a panel of CREB-dependent genes (Nur77 , Nurr1, Nor1, Areg , Il6 and ICER ) were determined by qPCR (A, C and E). As controls the induction
of two CREB-independent genes (IκBα, Egr1 or c-Jun depending on the stimuli) was also measured (B, D and F). Error bars are +

to their target promoters [41]. The ability of CREB to act
independently of Ser133 phosphorylation downstream of PKA
could be explained by CRTC recruitment. Prior to stimulation,
CRTCs are phosphorylated by a member of the SIK (saltinducible kinase) family on key 14-3-3-binding sites, leading to
the tethering of CRTCs in the cytoplasm [23,43]. Activation of
PKA promotes the dephosphorylation of these sites, allowing
CRTCs to translocate to the nucleus and interact with CREB
independently of Ser133 phosphorylation [23,44]. Although the
CREB S133A mutation did not abolish CRTC3 recruitment at
the level of endogenous promoters, we did observe that the amount
of CRTC3 recruitment, as determined by ChIP, correlated with the
phospho-CREB/ATF1 ChIP signal (Figure 3). This would agree
with the previous suggestion that CRTCs and CBP may form a
complex with CREB in which CRTC and CBP/p300 may stabilize
each other’s binding [45]. In general there was a good agreement
between those genes reported to be affected by the KIX domain

477

mutations in CBP and p300 and the data for the CREB S133A
knockin mutation described in the present study (Table 1).
In the second model, both CBP and p300 were knocked
out [41]. A more extensive analysis of CREB-dependent genes
was reported in [41] and, unexpectedly, although the ability of
forskolin to induce some CREB-dependent genes was decreased
in the CBP/p300 double-knockin MEFs, the transcription of
others was actually increased. Notably Nur77 and Nor1 were
increased in the absence of CBP and p300, but reduced by the
mutation of Ser133 in CREB or the KIX domains in CBP and
p300. Why this would occur is not clear; however, it may be
significant that CBP and p300 are able to interact with multiple
other transcription factors independently of their KIX domains.
Thus knockout of CBP and p300 will have effects on IE gene
transcription that is independent of CREB. Overall these studies
support a model in which PKA regulates CREB via at least
two independent mechanisms, phosphorylation of Ser133 and
recruitment of CRTCs; however, the relative importance of these
two mechanisms is promoter-specific.
As discussed above, although previous studies have indicated
that CREB phosphorylation does play a role in mediating CREB
activation downstream of cAMP, the role of Ser133 downstream
of MAPK signalling has been less clear. Unexpectedly we
show in the present study that the effect of the CREB S133A
knockin on CREB-dependent transcription was increased for
MAPK-induced transcription compared with that induced by
PKA activation for the CREB-dependent genes analysed in the
present study (Figures 2 and 5). In addition, different CREBdependent genes were more uniformly affected downstream of
MAPK activation by the S133A knockin mutation compared with
PKA activation. This could be explained by the ability of PKA to
regulate CREB via promoting the relocalization of CRTCs to the
nucleus where they can provide an alternative mechanism to Ser133
phosphorylation for activating CREB-dependent transcription. As
ERK1/2 signalling does not promote the dephosphorylation or
nuclear relocalization of CRTCs [24] (Figure 5), this might result
in a stronger dependence on CREB Ser133 phosphorylation. As
discussed above, Ser133 phosphorylation downstream of MAPK
signalling in cells does not effectively promote CBP or p300
binding to CREB. In line with this, we show in the present
study that PMA, which stimulates CREB phosphorylation via
ERK1/2, is a poor stimulus for CBP or p300 recruitment to
endogenous CREB-dependent promoters. Some recruitment was
seen to the Nur77 promoter; however, this may be explained
by the recruitment of CBP to a SRE (serum-response element)
nearby in the Nur77 promoter. SREs bind a complex of SRF
(serum-response factor) and an ETS domain transcription factor
such as Elk1 and this SRE-dependent transcription is known to
be promoted by ERK1/2 activation [46]. Related to this, Nur77
has been reported to be regulated in part by SRF in T-cells [47],
whereas CBP is known to be recruited to SRF [48,49].
Double knockout of CBP/p300 does not affect the induction of
CREB-dependent genes in response to serum, a strong activator
of ERK1/2 [28]. In contrast, S133A mutation resulted in a
major reduction in the induction of CREB-dependent IE genes
in response to PMA. Similar results on gene induction were also
obtained with the p38 MAPK-activating stimuli anisomycin. In
response to PMA and anisomycin, the main Ser133 kinases are
the MAPK-activated kinases MSK1 and MSK2. In accordance
with the results reported in the present study for the CREB
S133A mutant, double knockout of MSK1 and MSK2 has
been shown to reduce the induction of Nur77, Nurr1 and
Nor1 in MEFs in response to both PMA and anisomycin [42],
whereas Areg and IL-6 were also MSK regulated in MEFs
in response to these stimuli (Supplementary Figure S1). The

*Results from the present study

lack of effective CBP or p300 recruitment to CREB-dependent
promoters downstream of MAPK signalling, although consistent
with previous publications, is perhaps unexpected given the
dependence on Ser133 phosphorylation for CREB-dependent
transcription reported in the present paper. Although there is a
possibility that a weak interaction between CBP and CREB could
be missed in the ChIP assays, our results are consistent with the
finding that double knockout of CBP and p300 did not reduce
the induction of Areg or Nur77 by serum [28]. Consequently,
this would suggest that, although CREB Ser133 phosphorylation
by MSKs is critical for the transcriptional activation of CREB,
it might regulate CREB activity independently of CBP and
p300. This would imply the existence of a further CREB coactivator protein that would be recruited to CREB following
Ser133 phosphorylation by MSK, but not PKA. Why Ser133
phosphorylation has different effects on co-activator recruitment
in cells following phosphorylation by MSK or PKA is not clear.
One explanation could be that MAPK signalling may in some way
inhibit CBP recruitment to CREB. Of note, NGF (nerve growth
factor) and insulin have been shown to promote the formation of
a complex of the ERK1/2-activated kinase RSK and CBP, and
this was able to repress cAMP-induced gene induction [50]. A
subsequent report has, however, found that ERK1/2 activation
induced the dissociation of CBP and RSK [51]. Further work will
be required in order to resolve these issues.
In summary, in the present study we show that the
phosphorylation of CREB on Ser133 by MSKs is necessary for
the maximal induction of CREB-dependent IE genes. In addition,
we also show that MSK-mediated CREB phosphorylation has
a greater effect on IE gene induction compared with the
phosphorylation of the same site by PKA.

Additional analysis of gene induction in CREB S133A and MSK1/2 knockout MEFs

(A) Wild-type or CREB S133A knockin (ki) MEFs were stimulated with 20 μM forskolin for the indicated times. The levels of DUSP1 or JunB mRNA were determined by qPCR as described in the
Materials and methods section of the main text. Error bars are +
−S.D. of four independent stimulations per genotype. (B) Wild-type or MSK1/2 double knockout (ko) MEFs were stimulated with
400 ng/ml PMA, 10 μg/ml anisomycin or 20 μM forskolin as indicated for 2 h. Areg and IL-6 mRNA levels were then determined by qPCR. Error bars are +
−S.D. of four independent stimulations
per genotype. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 (Student’s t test) between the two genotypes.
