Intracisternal delivery of AAV9 results in oligodendrocyte
and motor neuron transduction in the whole central
nervous system of cats

Systemic and intracerebrospinal ﬂuid delivery of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) has been shown to achieve widespread
gene delivery to the central nervous system (CNS). However, after systemic injection, the neurotropism of the vector has been
reported to vary according to age at injection, with greater neuronal transduction in newborns and preferential glial cell tropism in
adults. This difference has not yet been reported after cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) delivery. The present study analyzed both neuronal
and glial cell transduction in the CNS of cats according to age of AAV9 CSF injection. In both newborns and young cats,
administration of AAV9-GFP in the cisterna magna resulted in high levels of motor neurons (MNs) transduction from the cervical
(84 ± 5%) to the lumbar (99 ± 1%) spinal cord, demonstrating that the remarkable tropism of AAV9 for MNs is not affected by age at
CSF delivery. Surprisingly, numerous oligodendrocytes were also transduced in the brain and in the spinal cord white matter of
young cats, but not of neonates, indicating that (i) age of CSF delivery inﬂuences the tropism of AAV9 for glial cells and (ii) AAV9
intracisternal delivery could be relevant for both the treatment of MN and demyelinating disorders.

INTRODUCTION
Adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene therapy holds great promise
for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.1 However, local administration usually restricts gene expression in the
targeted cerebral structures and does not allow widespread gene
delivery to the central nervous system (CNS), especially in glial
cells,2–4 yet implicated in several neurological diseases or
CNS injuries.5–8
Systemic AAV serotype 9 (AAV9) delivery has been shown to
efﬁciently transduce the whole spinal cord in neonatal mice and
kittens9,10 and to increase the life expectancy of neonatal mouse
models of spinal muscular atrophy.11–13 In adult mice, the results
differ according to the studies,14 but preferential glial cell
transduction has been reported in adults in contrast to neonates
injected intravenously (IV) with AAV9,9 suggesting that age at the
times of injection could potentially inﬂuence the neurotropism of
the vector and the efﬁciency of motor neuron (MN) and glial cell
transduction. In adult primates, AAV9 targeted also preferentially
astrocytes and less efﬁciently neurons when it was administered IV.14,15
Recently, delivery of AAV9 in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) was
shown to target neurons throughout the CNS, including the brain,
spinal cord or dorsal root ganglia, in mice and in large animals,
that is, primates, dogs and pigs.16–21 However, the inﬂuence of age
at the times of CSF delivery on MN and glial cell transduction is
not yet clearly determined.
The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of
transduced MNs all along the spinal cord and the proﬁle of glial

cell transduction in the whole CNS after intracisternal (IC) injection
of self-complementary (sc) AAV9-CMV (cytomegalovirus)-GFP
(green ﬂuorescent protein) vectors in both neonatal and young
cats, a large animal model in which different neurodegenerative
diseases22–26 and MN degeneration27 have been described. Our
results showed that scAAV9 injected in the CSF transduced the
vast majority of MNs all along the spinal cord (84 ± 5% in the
cervical, 99 ± 1% in the lumbar), whatever the age at the times of
injection, with a limited off-target biodistribution of the vector.
Surprisingly, in addition to a signiﬁcant transduction of neurons in
the spinal cord and in various brain structures, an important
proportion of oligodendrocytes was also found to express GFP in
the spinal cord and brain white matter, but only in young cats.
These results indicate a particular tropism of AAV9 for oligodendrocytes when it is administered by IC delivery after the neonatal
period that in turn may have important consequences, especially
for the treatment of demyelinating diseases affecting the
whole CNS.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To determine glial cell and MN transduction proﬁles in the CNS
vs age of AAV9 CSF delivery in cats, three 2-day-old kittens
(C1, C2, C3) and three 7-week-old young cats (C4, C5, C6) were
injected with 1012 viral genomes (vg) kg−1 of scAAV9-CMV-GFP in
the cisterna magna and killed at 1 month post injection. A GFP
signal was observed in the dorsal and ventral parts of the spinal

cord in both neonates and young cats (Figure 1). In the dorsal part,
the GFP signal was found in the dorsal columns, especially in the
axons of the gracile and cuneate fasciculi identiﬁed by neuroﬁlament immunostaining (data not shown), suggesting that sensory
neurons of the dorsal root ganglias were efﬁciently targeted by
the vector after CSF delivery.
In the ventral horn, the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)
immunostaining demonstrated that a large number of MNs
expressed the GFP (Figure 1a and insets in young cats;
Figure 1d and insets in neonates and Supplementary Figure S1)
homogeneously all along the ventral horn from the cervical to the
lumbar part (Figures 1a–f and Supplementary Figure S1). Moreover, the GFP signal was also detected in the axons of the
sciatic nerve in both neonates and young cats, indicating
a transport of the GFP protein all along the peripheral axonal
pathway (Figure 1c, inset in young cats; Figure 1f, inset in
neonates).
The GFP-positive MNs were scored in cervical and lumbar
enlargements that innervate upper and lower limbs, respectively.
MN quantiﬁcation revealed that 86.1 ± 6.8 and 82.7 ± 7.4% of the
lower MNs expressed GFP in the cervical enlargement of the
injected neonates and young cats, respectively (Table 1, expressed
as mean ± s.e.m., no statistical difference: P >0.05). The number of

transduced MNs was slightly increased in the lumbar enlargement
with 99.9 ± 0.1% (neonates) and 97.9 ± 1.2% (young cats) GFPpositive MNs. A lower number of GFP-positive MNs was found in

the cervical spinal cord of two cats (51.4% for the neonate cat C1
and 48.2% for the young cat C5) compared with the other cats
(100% and 98.7% for the neonate cats C2 and C3, respectively,
100% for both the young cats C4 and C6). This disparity was not
observed in the lumbar spinal cord where >95% of MNs expressed
GFP in all the cats. These data suggest that AAV9 vector targeted
more efﬁciently MNs of the lumbar than of the cervical regions
after IC delivery in some animals. These data could be explained
by the ﬂow of CSF secreted in the cerebral ventricles and driven to
the cauda equina, allowing AAV particles, injected in cisterna
magna, to be transported to the lumbar spinal cord with an
efﬁciency and a diffusion rate that probably vary according to the
conditions of AAV injection, the volume, the ﬂow rate or the
position of the animal.
On the other hand, no statistical difference (P >0.05) was found
between IC injections in neonates vs in young cats in contrast
to data previously obtained after IV injections in mice,9,11
indicating that the dispersion and the tropism of AAV9 for MNs
was not affected by the animal age after IC injection. This
difference could be related to the route of administration as the IC
injection concentrates the AAV particles in the nervous tissue.
Besides, the proportion of transduced MNs was higher in this
study than those previously detected after IV injection in newborn
cats (transduced MNs: ≈40%) and in young cats (transduced
MNs: ≈15%).10
Moreover, GFP-speciﬁc real-time quantitative PCR performed in
the spinal cord of the newborns (C1, C2, C3), as well as in the
spinal cord and the peripheral organs of the young cats injected in
the cisterna magna (C4, C5 and C6) and in three other young cats
(C7, C8, C9) injected with 1012 vg kg−1 of scAAV9-CMV-GFP in the
jugular vein showed higher number of vg in the spinal cord after
IC delivery (0.07 ± 0.01 in newborns, 0.38 ± 0.04 vg dg−1 in young
cats for IC vs 0.02 ± 3 × 10 3 vg dg in young cats for IV; 10 3 ±
7 × 10−4 vg dg−1 for uninjected cat; comparison between IC and
IV-injected young cats: Po 0.005) and a lower dispersion of the
vector to the periphery compared with the systemic administration of the vector in young cats (2.3 ± 0.8 vg dg−1 in the liver for
IC vs 28.1 ± 16.2 vg dg−1 for IV, 0.01 vg dg−1 for uninjected cat;
Supplementary Figure S2). These results suggest that a large
number of viral particles penetrated and persisted in the spinal
cord after IC delivery compared with IV injection with a limited offtarget biodistribution of the vector in systemic organs, for
instance, the liver, consistent with recent studies performed in
other large animal models.18,20,28
To determine the nature of the transduced cells throughout the
CNS, the brains of the injected cats were also examined for GFP
expression. The vector transduced neurons in the cerebellum,
thalamus, striatum, motor and sensory cortex of both newborn
(data not shown) and young injected cats, as we previously
showed.29 In addition to GFP-positive neurons, transduced
astrocytes were also seen in the cerebral cortex of newborn and
young cats (Figure 2), indicating that IC injection of AAV9 resulted
in both neuronal and astrocytic transduction in the gray matter of
the brain, consistent with recent reports in primates17,18 or in
dogs.21 More surprisingly, glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP)positive ﬁbrous astrocytes in the brain and a signiﬁcant number of
oligodendrocytes throughout both the corona radiata in the brain
and the white matter all along the spinal cord expressed GFP
(Figure 2). Transduced oligodendrocytes were found in different
brain regions from the frontal to the occipital lobes and in the
brainstem (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S3). This important
transduction of oligodendrocytes in both the brain and the spinal
cord has been found only in the young cats injected after the
neonatal period. In contrast, cats injected during the neonatal
period did not exhibit GFP-positive oligodendrocytes in the spinal
cord and brain white matter.
This difference of AAV9 tropism for glial cells between neonates
and young cats could be related to AAV9 receptors. Indeed,
Gene Therapy (2014) 522 – 528

AAV9 uses β-galactose as a receptor to transduce many different
cell types in vitro,30 and tissue glycosylation proﬁles was
shown to affect AAV9 tropism.31 Tissue glycosylation level could
therefore explain the different transduction proﬁles we observed
in the CNS of newborn and young cats after AAV9 IC delivery. To
investigate this hypothesis, we cut the brain of a 10-day-old
newborn kitten C10 and the brain of a 3 year-old adult
cat C11 and used rhodamine-conjugated Ricinus Communis
Agglutinin I, known to bind speciﬁcally to terminal β-galactose
residues and therefore described to inhibit binding of AAV9.32,33
We observed a signiﬁcant reduction of β-galactose staining,
especially in the white matter of brain, in the 10-day-old kitten
compared with the adult cat brain (Supplementary Figure S4;
7.5 ± 1.1 Mean Gray Value for the neonate C10 vs 15.1 ± 0.9 Mean
Gray Value for the adult cat C11; P o0.001 by Mann–Whitney
U-test). These data suggest that the absence of transduced oligodendrocytes in the brain white matter of neonatal kittens could be
explained in part by a smaller number of accessible AAV9
receptors in brain tissue of neonatal kittens compared with brain
tissue of older cats.
Another explanation could be related to the CSF volume, higher
with regard to the body weight in neonate compared with
juveniles that could therefore result in different vector concentration within the CNS.
The tropism of AAV9 for oligodendrocytes has never been
described by other studies using CSF delivery of the vector in mice
and different large animals.16–21 The purity of AAV vector
preparations could potentially explain this particular tropism.
Indeed, cesium chloride (CsCl)-puriﬁed AAV vectors have been
described to contain large amount of impurities34 and to display
an astroglial transduction pattern in contrast to the expected
neuronal expression.35 The authors hypothesized that protein
impurities obtained after the CsCl puriﬁcation could induce
astrogliosis that could stimulate transgene expression in astroglial
cells and inhibit neuronal transduction. Otherwise, dilution of the
vector particles, variation in particles conformation or active
interference with vector uptake could also affect the neuronal
tropism of the vector in relation to the degree of protein
impurities or the method of puriﬁcation.
In this study, we used an optimized CsCl protocol34 resulting in
higher AAV vector purity that could induce high transduction
efﬁciency both in neurons and oligodendrocytes after CSF delivery
of the vector.
The promoter used, that is, the CMV promoter, may also impact
on the number and the nature of the transduced cells within the
CNS after CSF injection. Indeed, in studies describing neuronal
transduction after IV or CSF delivery of AAV9, different types of
promoter have been used, including CBA (chicken beta actin),
CMV or CBh (chicken beta actin short), and there is increasing
evidence that the choice of the promoter is critical for transgene
expression in neuronal or glial cell types. The CMV promoter has
been described as poorly effective in inducing transgene
expression in astrocytes16 in concordance with our results,
especially in neonatal kittens. On the other hand, the CMV
promoter has been shown to mediate higher transgene expression in MNs than the CBA promoter.16,19 Nevertheless, in large
animals, only CBA and CBh promoters were used when AAV9 was
delivered in the CSF.17,18,20,21 The combination of a CMV promoter
and a new method of CsCl puriﬁcation may thus explain in cats
the speciﬁc tropism of the vector described in this study, that is,
the transduction of both oligodendrocytes and MNs with a high
efﬁciency.
Futhermore, our study indicates that IC delivery of AAV9 could
be used to mediate high transduction of oligodendrocytes in the
whole CNS in contrast to AAV intracerebral injections that usually
target a small number of oligodendrocytes locally.36,37
Finally, to investigate the immunogenicity induced by AAV9 IC
delivery, we quantiﬁed the AAV9 capsid-neutralizing antibodies in

the serum and in the CSF of injected cats at the time of killing. The
IC route systematically resulted in AAV9 antibodies in the sera with
a titer varying between 1/10 and 1/2000, independently of the age
of the animal (Table 2). In contrast, AAV9 antibodies were detected
in the CSF of only one young cat (cat C5), at low level (1/20,
Table 2). Interestingly, the cat C5 did not exhibit the highest titer
of AAV9-neutralizing antibodies in the serum but showed a large
number of vector copies in the periphery, especially in the liver
(ﬁve vector copies per diploid genome, Supplementary Figure S2).
These results may suggest that (i) the level of AAV9-neutralizing
antibodies in the serum does not predict for the presence of antiAAV9 antibodies in the CSF and (ii) a signiﬁcant number of vg in
the periphery after CSF delivery of the vector might elicit a
production of AAV9-speciﬁc antibodies within the CNS.
These results also conﬁrm recent data obtained in dogs that
also display asymmetrical distribution of AAV-neutralizing antibodies across the blood–brain barrier, with high serumneutralizing antibody titers and low CSF-neutralizing antibody
titers after IC delivery of AAV9 vector.21 Taken together, these

results suggest that it could be possible to re-inject AAV9 vectors
in the CSF of the majority of animals that received an initial IC
injection of the vector. This hypothesis is also consistent with
recent data showing spinal cord transduction after intrathecal
delivery of AAV9 vector in non-human primates or in dogs despite
the presence of pre-existing immunity against AAV.21,38
We also investigated the presence of GFP-speciﬁc antibodies in
the serum of injected animals at 4 weeks post-injection by
western blotting. The presence of small amounts of GFP-speciﬁc
antibodies in the serum of a young cat (C6) and of the
three injected newborn kittens (C1, C2 and C3; Supplementary
Figure S2) indicated that IC injection did not prevent the
development of immune responses against the immunogenic
GFP protein. Further investigation may therefore be necessary to
ensure long-term expression of potential therapeutic transgenes in
the CNS of large animal models after CSF delivery of AAV9 vector.
Altogether, the results of this study highlight the potential of IC
AAV9 delivery to transfer therapeutic gene to MNs and oligodendrocytes in the whole CNS providing a potential application
for the treatment of both MN and demyelinating diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Vectors
Pseudotyped AAV9 vectors were generated by packaging AAV2-based
recombinant sc genomes in AAV9 capsids39 puriﬁed by double CsCl
gradient as previously described,34 at the University Hospital of Nantes
(http://www.vectors.nantes.inserm.fr). The AAV2 plasmids contained the
gene encoding GFP under the control of CMV promoter in a sc genome.
Physical particles were quantiﬁed by dot blot hybridization, and vector
titers were expressed as vector genomes per milliliter.

In vivo AAV injections
Breeding and injected healthy cats were housed in the Boisbonne Center at
Nantes Veterinary School (ONIRIS, Nantes, France). Experiments were
approved by the Regional Ethics Committee and were carried out according
to the European guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals.
Three 2-day-old healthy kittens (C1, C2, C3) and three 7-week-old
healthy young cats (C4, C5, C6) were injected with 1012 vg kg−1 of scAAV9CMV-GFP in the cisterna magna with a volume of 1 ml kg−1 under general
anesthesia obtained by isoﬂurane inhalation (3% v/v) and morphine
injection (0.2 mg kg−1). Neonatal kittens weighed between 100 and 200 g
and received between 0.1 and 0.2 ml of AAV9 vector (concentration: 1012
vg ml−1 in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)). Seven-week-old
cats weighed between 1 and 1.5 kg and received 1–1.5 ml of the vector at
the same concentration. In all, 0.1–0.2 ml of CSF in newborns and
approximately 1 ml of CSF in young cats were removed before the
injection of the vector to avoid any risk of intracranial hypertension.
No side effect possibly related to surgery or vector deposits was noticed.
The absence of AAV9-neutralizing antibodies was checked in the serum of
7-week-old cats and in the serum of mothers of neonatal kittens, before
injection. For IV injections, 1012 vg kg−1 of scAAV9-CMV-GFP in a volume of
1 ml kg−1 were injected into the jugular vein of three 7-week-old healthy
young cats (C7, C8 and C9).

Tissue preparation
One month following IC or IV injection, animals were anesthetized (150 μg
kg−1 medetomidine, 10 mg kg−1 ketamine, 0.2 mg kg−1 morphine) and
perfused transcardially with 10 ml PBS followed by 100 ml 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains and spinal cords were removed and cut into coronal 5-mm
blocks, post-ﬁxed by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde and cryoprotected by overnight incubation in 30% sucrose. Samples were embedded
in optimal cutting temperature compound, frozen on dry ice and cryostat
sectioned (10 μm).

GFP expression, immunostaining and MN quantiﬁcation
Spinal cord and brain slices were examined for GFP expression using a laser
scanning confocal microscope (Nikon, C1, Champigny sur Marne, France)
equipped by a blue argon ion laser at 488 m. For ChAT immunoﬂuorescence, the brain and spinal cord sections were blocked by incubation
with 1% rabbit serum (Dako, Les Ulis, France) in 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS and
Gene Therapy (2014) 522 – 528

incubated overnight at room temperature with a goat polyclonal anti-ChAT
antibody (1:100, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA); the sections
were then incubated with a biotinylated rabbit anti-goat antibody (1/300,
Dako). For GFAP and Olig2 immunostaining, the brain and spinal cord
sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with antibodies
directed against GFAP (1/4000, Dako) or Olig-2 (1/100, Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) followed by a biotinylated rabbit anti-goat antibody (1/300, Dako).
Sections were then incubated with Alexa ﬂuor 555-conjugated streptavidin
(Life Technologies, Saint Aubin, France), mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem,
San Diego, CA, USA) and scanned serially using the argon ion laser (488 nm)
to observe GFP signals and with a helium neon laser (543 nm) to observe
Alexa ﬂuor 555 signals. Each image was recorded in a separated channel
(channel green for GFP and channel red for Alexa ﬂuor 555) and overlayed
to allow detection of colocalized ﬂuorescent signals.
For MN quantiﬁcation, the number of Nissl-stained (Neurotrace
Molecular Probes, Life Technologies) and GFP-positive MNs was estimated
relative to the total number of MNs using the NIS-Elements AR Image
analyzer (Nikon) on 10-μm thick sections (two sections containing two
ventral horns for each cervical and lumbar enlargement). The count of
GFP-positive MNs was performed for each cat using four ventral horns
of both cervical and lumbar intumescences. For each horn, an average of
15–20 MNs were counted, resulting in a total of 60–80 MNs for each region
and approximately a total of 140 MNs per cat.
Furthermore, a 7.2 mm length horizontal section was performed in the
thoracic spinal cord of the newborn cat C1 and of the young cat C5 to
verify the homogeneous distribution of GFP-positive MNs throughout the
spinal cord.

Galactose residue staining in feline brain tissue
The brains of two cats—a neonatal kitten C10, who died 10 days after birth,
and an adult cat C11 killed at the age of 3 years—were used to stain
β-galactose residues in feline CNS tissue. Brains were cut into coronal
5-mm blocks, frozen on dry ice and cryostat-sectioned (10 μm). Tissue
cryosections were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with blocking buffer and
rhodamine ricinus communis agglutinin RCA120 (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA) was added at 100 μg ml-1 in blocking buffer or
blocking solution alone for control and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min32. The
lectine sol ution was then removed, and sections were washed in PBS and
mounted in Mowiol medium.

Quantitative PCR Analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen tissues of the newborns (C1, C2,
C3) and of the young cats (C4, C5 and C6) injected in the cisterna magna
and of three other young cats (C7, C8, C9) injected with 1012 vg kg−1 of
scAAV9-CMV-GFP in the jugular vein as previously described.29 Real-time
PCR was conducted in duplicate with a LightCycler 2.0 instrument (Roche
Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) using 50 ng of DNA in a 20-μl volume
of the following solution: 10 μl Premix ExTaq (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan),
0.4 μl 10 μM Primer, 0.4 μl 10 μM FAM/TAMRA TaqMan probe, 5 μl template,
and 3.8 μl H2O. The feline β-glucuronidase (βGLU) gene was used as a
reference, and for each sample, Ct values were compared with those
obtained with plasmid standard dilutions containing GFP and βGLU cDNA
sequences. The ratio between transgene (GFP sequence) and genomic
DNA (βGLU sequence) copy number provided the amount of transgene
copy per cell. Primers and probe for GFP were : forward primer 5′-ACTA
CAACAGCCACAACGTCTATATCA-3′, reverse primer 5′-GGCGGATCTTGAAGT
TCACC-3′, probe 6FAM5′-CCGACAAGCAGAAGAACGGCATCA-3′-TAMRA,
and for feline βGLU : forward primer 5′-ACGCTGATTGCTCACACCAA-3′,
reverse primer 5′-CCCCAGGTCTGCTTCATAGTT-3′, probe 6FAM5′-CCGGCCC
GTGACCTTTGTGA-3′-TAMRA. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 20 s
followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 40 s. Control tissues extracted separately from vector-treated tissues were checked for GFP ampliﬁcation. The sensitivity of the quantitative PCR is 10−3 copies/cell or 100
copies/50 ng of genomic DNA.

Detection of AAV9-speciﬁc antibodies and GFP-speciﬁc antibodies
AAV9-speciﬁc antibodies in the serum and CSF of injected and uninjected
cats were detected according to a previously described procedure.40
Brieﬂy, serum or CSF samples were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 35 min.
Recombinant ssAAV2/9.CMV.LacZ (4 × 103 vg/well) was diluted in serumfree Dulbecco’s modiﬁcation of Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Sigma Aldrich,
Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine
serum (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) and incubated with serial dilutions

(initial dilution, 1:10) of heat-inactivated serum or CSF samples on DMEM
for 20 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, sample vector mixture was added to 96well plates containing 2 × 105 Hela T cells/well that had been infected 2 h
earlier with wild-type HAdV5 (8 viral particles/cell). After an incubation of
24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, cells were ﬁxed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and
developed with X-Gal solution (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The antibody
titer was reported as the highest serum or CSF dilution that inhibited
ssAAV2/9.CMV.LacZ transduction (β-galactosidase expression) by 100%.
GFP-speciﬁc antibodies were detected by western blotting. Brieﬂy,
following electrophoresis of 200 ng of recombinant GFP (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) per lane, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane
(Hybond, Amersham, Les Ulis, France) blocked with a solution of PBS
supplemented with 5% non-fat dry milk, 1% NP-40 and 0.1% Tween 20
overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then immunoblotted for 2 h with the
sera of injected animals diluted at 1:100 and next incubated with
peroxidase-labeled goat anti-cat immunoglobulin G (1:15000, Serotec,
Oxford, UK) for 45 min. Rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (Millipore, Temecula, CA,
USA) served as a positive control. All membranes were visualized using
ECL Hyperﬁlm (GE Healthcare, Velizy-Villacoublay, France) and exposure to
ECL Hyperﬁlm.

Statistical analyses
Data were expressed as means ± s.e.m. Statistical comparisons between
the experimental groups were performed by the Mann–Whitney U-test.
P-values o0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
