Abstract Increased levels of extracellular glutamate and
hyperactivation of glutamatergic receptors in the basal
ganglia trigger a critical cascade of events involving both
intracellular pathways and cell-to-cell interactions that
affect cell viability and promote neuronal death. The
ensemble of these glutamate-triggered events is responsible
for excitotoxicity, a phenomenon involved in several
pathological conditions affecting the central nervous system, including a neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD is an age-related disorder caused
by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons within the
substantia nigra pars compacta, with a miscellaneous
pathogenic background. Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity
may be involved in a lethal vicious cycle, which critically
contributes to the exacerbation of nigrostriatal degeneration in PD. Since excitotoxicity is a glutamate-receptormediated phenomenon, growing interest and work have
been dedicated to the research for modulators of glutamate
neurotransmission that might enable new therapeutic
interventions to slow down the neurodegenerative process
and ameliorate PD motor symptoms.

Introduction
Excitotoxicity is the pathological process through which
neurons are damaged and killed after excessive stimulation
of glutamatergic receptors by glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system
(CNS), or similar substrates. Excitotoxicity is due to
intracellular processes, such as calcium overload and bioenergetic changes, which increase the oxidative burden and
activate apoptosis. Notably, excitotoxic phenomena are
involved in several brain diseases such as stroke, epilepsy
and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s
disease and Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Mehta et al. 2013;
Koutsilieri and Riederer 2007). PD is a very common agerelated pathology affecting more than 1 % of the population over 60 years of age. The majority of cases (about
90 %) are sporadic and aging is the major risk factor, while
only 10 % of cases show monogenic basis and are defined
as familial (de Lau and Breteler 2006). PD pathogenesis is
a complex and multifactorial process in which both genetic
features and environmental stressors converge and compromise neuron viability by affecting the cellular systems
dedicated to the maintenance of homeostasis: protein
quality control systems and mitochondria. PD is caused by
the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), a mesencephalic
nucleus included in the basal ganglia circuitry, which is
responsible for the modulation of voluntary movement.
Typical PD symptoms include resting tremor, bradykinesia,
rigidity and postural instability. The pharmacological
treatment currently available is purely symptomatic and is
based on the restoration of dopamine levels in the brain by
administration of its precursor, 3,4-hydroxyphenylalanine
(L-Dopa), which significantly ameliorates PD motor deficit.
However, chronic treatment with L-Dopa is frequently

associated with progressive reduction of drug’s efficacy
and the development of motor complications culminating
with involuntary movements known as L-Dopa-induced
dyskinesias (LIDs) (Salat and Tolosa 2013).
Within the basal ganglia other neurotransmitter systems,
such as GABAergic, cholinergic and glutamatergic, are
present together with the dopaminergic system. In particular, glutamatergic stimulation in the basal ganglia has two
major sources (Fig. 1): the projections from the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the only excitatory nucleus of the
system, and the motor cortex. Secondary glutamatergic
afferents to the SNc proceed from the amygdala, the peduncolopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei
(reviewed in Misgeld 2004). In PD, the altered neurotransmission observed within the basal ganglia affects the
glutamatergic system, thereby suggesting a critical
involvement of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in the
pathogenesis as well as in the progression of the neurodegenerative process underlying the disease.

Glutamate and glutamatergic synapses
At excitatory synapses, glutamate is stored in vesicles and
can be found in both pre- and post-synaptic neurons, as
well as in glial cells, astrocytes in particular. Intracellular
glutamate is relatively inactive and its concentration is
10,000 times higher than outside the cell, since extracellular glutamate concentration is tightly regulated to be
maintained within a tolerable range. Astrocytes contribute
to buffer most of the extracellular glutamate by promoting
its uptake through high affinity protein carriers named
Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs) and by
performing the intracellular conversion of glutamate into
the inactive metabolite glutamine (Rothstein et al. 1996).
Glutamate per se is not toxic, but can exert toxic effects by
persistently and excessively stimulating glutamatergic
receptors, which can be classified into two major families:
(a) ionotropic receptors that incorporate a cationic ion
channel and (b) metabotropic receptors linked to G
proteins.

Ionotropic receptors

glutamate as indicated by the thickness of the arrows. Excitotoxic
phenomena in PD are associated with and accelerate the progressive

Glutamate can activate three types of ionotropic receptors:
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), a-amino-3hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors
(AMPARs) and kainate receptors. Ionotropic glutamate
receptors are ligand-gated ion channels permeable to
positive ions, expressed in several areas of the CNS where
they mediate depolarization of neuronal membrane
potential and fast excitatory transmission. More critically,
they are involved in the induction of phenomena of shortand long-term synaptic plasticity such as long-term
potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), the molecular
basis of memory formation (Rebola et al. 2010).
NMDARs are heteromeric complexes incorporating
different subunits within a repertoire of three subtypes:
NR1, NR2 and NR3 (Paoletti et al. 2013). These receptors
are permeable to positive ions, calcium (Ca2?) in particular, and they can have either synaptic or extrasynaptic
localization. The current prevailing theory on NMDARmediated toxicity indicates that extrasynaptic rather than
synaptic receptors contribute to excitotoxicity, according to
their different subunit composition (Hardingham and
Bading 2010). In fact, the presence of the NR2B subunit in
the extrasynaptic NMDARs is thought to be responsible for
excitotoxic phenomena; while the presence of NR2A subunit in the synaptic ones has been shown to activate neurotrophic pathways (Kaufman et al. 2012). Differently,
Zhou and collaborators recently demonstrated that selective activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs alone is not toxic
in neuron primary cultures and suggest that the onset of

The role of excitotoxicity

excitotoxic processes is rather dependent on the magnitude
and duration of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs coactivation (Zhou et al. 2013).
AMPARs are tetramers and their composition can vary
and include different combinations of four different subunit
types. AMPARs are permeable to sodium, potassium and
also to Ca2?, depending on their subunit composition, and
mediate fast synaptic transmission. Their structure and
distribution in the brain is extremely heterogeneous and
their activity at the synapse is dynamic and dependent on
multiple factors, such as phosphorylation or associated
transmembrane regulatory proteins. AMPARs may play a
critical role in several brain diseases, ranging from ischemia to neurodegeneration (Chang et al. 2012).
Kainate receptors are permeable to sodium and potassium. They have tetrameric structure and their final composition is determined by selecting out of five different
subunit types. Kainate receptors are ubiquitously distributed in the CNS, where they are found mainly in the hippocampus, lateral amygdala, cerebral cortex, globus
pallidus and cerebellum. Post-synaptic kainate receptors
mediate synaptic transmission, whereas pre-synaptic
modulate neurotransmitter release at several synapses,
thereby affecting short and long-term plasticity (Huettner
2003). Recent evidence shows that kainate receptors contribute to neurodegeneration by promoting not only excitotoxicity, but also microglial activation and
neuroinflammation (Zhang and Zhu 2011).

Metabotropic glutamate receptors
Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) modulate
glutamatergic neurotransmission and synergistically interact with ionotropic receptors; mGluR subtypes have been
classified into three groups according to sequence similarity, signal transduction mechanism, and pharmacological properties. Group I (mGlu1 and 5) receptors are
coupled to activation of phospholipase C and mediate postsynaptic excitatory effects. They are mainly located postsynaptically and modulate glutamate transmission through,
respectively, negative and positive regulation of potassium
and Ca2? ion channels. Group II (mGlu2 and 3) and Group
III (mGlu4, 6, 7, and 8) receptors are negatively coupled to
adenyl cyclase and inhibit cAMP formation. Both groups
are generally located pre-synaptically and inhibit glutamate
release from axon terminals, thereby reducing glutamatemediated excitotoxicity and preventing further activation
of NMDARs. Also, mGluRs might exert their downstream
action by functionally and/or physically interacting with
other receptor types, such as dopamine and adenosine
receptors (Ferré et al. 2007). Finally, mGluRs are involved
in the activation of signaling pathways that modulate cell

viability and stress responses, such as mitogen-activated
protein kinase/extracellular receptor kinase (MAPK/ERK)
pathway (Niswender and Conn 2010).

Excitotoxicity and the (in)direct role of glutamate
Excitotoxicity is mediated by glutamatergic receptor overstimulation and can be either directly or indirectly triggered
by glutamate. Excitotoxicity directly mediated by glutamate
is highly dependent on the neurotransmitter concentration.
In fact, excessive glutamate levels in the synaptic cleft
cause hyperactivity of glutamatergic systems and eventually neurotoxicity, mostly through over-stimulation of
NMDARs. In line with this affirmation, agonists of
NMDARs such as quinolinic acid (QUIN) are responsible
for excitotoxic effects. QUIN, a metabolite of the kynurenine pathway, the main pathway of tryptophan (TRP)
metabolism, was shown to both increase neurotransmitter
release at glutamatergic pre-synaptic terminals (Tavares
et al. 2002) and directly act as a competitive agonist on
post-synaptic NMDARs (de Carvalho et al. 1996). Furthermore, it was shown that persistently high concentrations
of glutamate at striatal synapses lead to self-accumulation
of glutamate in astrocytes. This phenomenon activates gliosis, saturates astrocyte capacity of buffering glutamate by
reducing glutamine synthetase activity, and further promotes excitotoxicity (Morales and Rodriguez 2012).
Differently, indirect (or slow) excitotoxicity is mediated
by stimulation of glutamatergic receptors in the absence of
elevated extracellular levels of glutamate and is associated
with any process that may compromise a neuron’s ability to
maintain normal membrane potential, such as intrinsic or
toxin-induced mitochondrial deficits. This concept was at
the root of the indirect excitotoxic hypothesis postulated in
the early’90s by Albin and Greenamyre (Albin and
Greenamyre 1992). In fact, membrane depolarization
increases the opening rate of calcium-permeable, voltagedependent channels, including NMDARs (Perez-Pinzon
et al. 2012; Mehta et al. 2013), thereby activating the
downstream pathways associated with excitotoxicity.
Being an energy-dependent process, maintenance of
membrane potential requires normal mitochondrial efficiency; it ensues that, for example, a powerful complex I
inhibitor such as rotenone can increase the excitotoxic
potential of glutamate by enhancing the vulnerability of
dopaminergic neurons even to low concentrations of the
neurotransmitter (Wu and Johnson 2009). More recently,
Nguyen et al. (2011) reported that imbalance in mitochondrial fission/fusion leads to NMDAR up-regulation
and oxidative stress, thereby proposing an additional link
between bioenergetic defects and increased susceptibility
to glutamate-mediated cytotoxicity.

Molecular mechanisms underlying glutamate-mediated
excitotoxicity
Calcium and the ‘‘source specificity’’ hypothesis
According to the literature, excitotoxicity is mainly due
to glutamate-triggered changes in intracellular Ca2?
levels. Ca2?-mediated neurotoxicity is strictly linked to
the entry point of the ion. In fact, if Ca2? enters the cell
through the L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, no
cell damage occurs. Conversely, if similar increase in
intracellular Ca2? is caused by glutamate-induced stimulation of NMDARs, remarkable neurotoxicity is
observed (Sattler et al. 1998; Koutsilieri and Riederer
2007). After glutamatergic stimulation, NMDARs are
immediately activated and Ca2? can directly enter the
cell through them. The initial Ca2? internalization is
followed by a delayed Ca2? overload caused by the
release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial stores. This phenomenon is modulated also by
transmembrane mGluRs and is responsible for secondary
cascades involving calpains and activation of pathways
leading to either necrotic or apoptotic cell death. Usually,
intense stimulation of the NMDARs causes a downstream process of macromolecules degradation finally
inducing necrotic cell death. Differently, mild or chronic
stimulation of the NMDARs activate apoptotic pathways
and eventually cell death when the increase in intracellular Ca2? exceeds the mitochondrial buffering capacity
(Nicholls 2008). These observations have led to the
‘‘source-specificity’’ hypothesis, which suggests that
enzymes or mediators of downstream pathways responsible for excitotoxicity co-localize with NMDARs at
post-synaptic densities (Kennedy 1997; Hardingham and
Bading 2003).
Ca2? overload is responsible for inducing the activity
of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and affecting mitochondrial integrity and functions. Ca2? directly enhances
reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS)
production. Increased levels of ROS inhibit mitochondrial
complex I activity, pyruvate dehydrogenase and critical
enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, thereby
leading to impaired ATP production and energetic crisis.
Moreover, glutamate-induced oxidative stress leads to
mitochondrial fragmentation, which promotes NMDARs
up-regulation and further contributes to the vicious cycle
of excitotoxicity and neuronal death (Nguyen et al. 2011).
Finally, Ca2? overload directly triggers the opening of the
mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore and
cytochrome c release, further concurring to the damage of
cellular macromolecules and the activation of apoptogenic
pathways (Fig. 2).

123

Fig. 2 Cellular mechanisms underlying glutamate-dependent excitotoxicity. To maintain optimal extracellular concentration, glutamate
released at synapses is promptly internalized through EAATs and the
buffering process is mainly mediated by astrocytes. Excitotoxic
phenomena usually happen when glutamate cannot be properly
buffered and very high levels of neurotransmitter are present in the
synaptic cleft. There are two parallel intracellular mechanisms that
mediate glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity: one is dependent on the
raise of intracellular Ca2? levels and another is dependent on
metabolic changes in the neurons and, to a lesser extent, in the
astrocytes. Both pathways impact on mitochondrial functions and
eventually converge on the same downstream effects such as increase
of oxidative stress, activation of pro-apoptotic factors, opening of
MPT pore and cytochrome c release in the neurons, which eventually
cause cell death. EAATs excitatory amino acid transporters, ER

Glucose metabolism and astrocyte-neuron interactions
In the previous paragraph we stressed the concept that all
of the intracellular oxidative changes and pro-apoptotic
signals associated with glutamate-induced excitotoxicity
are simply a consequence of intracellular Ca2? overload.
Recently, Bolaños and his collaborators (RodriguezRodriguez et al. 2012) presented different, intriguing
mechanisms that would parallel and reinforce Ca2?induced excitotoxicity, involving both neuron-astrocyte
interactions and metabolic changes during glutamatergic
neurotransmission. They suggest that glutamate receptor
activation is coupled with signaling cascade pathways
regulating glucose metabolism in both astrocytes and

The role of excitotoxicity

neurons. As already mentioned, astrocytes are in charge of
glutamate uptake from the synaptic cleft at the expenses of
the intracellular ATP reservoir. Energy consumption in the
astrocytes promotes glucose internalization and compensatory activation of glycolysis (Pellerin and Magistretti
1994). Concomitantly, in the neurons, glutamate-mediated
NMDARs stimulation increases oxidative metabolism as
well as glycolysis. In fact, NMDARs activation induces a
critical metabolic change by shifting the substrate preference from lactate to glucose (Bak et al. 2006) and redirecting glucose utilization from the pentose phosphate to
the glycolytic pathway (Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al. 2012).
Altogether these conditions lead to increased energy
metabolism and ATP synthesis and, most importantly, to
depletion of antioxidant molecules in the neurons. In fact,
one of the main functions of the pentose phosphate pathway is obtaining reducing equivalents in the form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) from
glucose oxidation. Thus, in physiological conditions, neurons tend to favor the activation of the pentose phosphate
pathway over glycolysis to continuously regenerate
NADPH, which is essential to maintain the pool of glutathione and other antioxidant molecules in a reduced state
(Yin et al. 2012). The ‘‘metabolic reprogramming’’ induced
by NMDARs ultimately leads to impaired neuronal
capacity of detoxifying ROS and RNS and, after persistent
stimulation, to the activation of pro-apoptotic factors
(Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al. 2012). Therefore, the association between Ca2?-induced dynamics and dysregulation
of glucose metabolism critically interact and synergistically contribute to the neurodegenerative process triggered
by glutamate excitotoxicity (Fig. 2).

PD and glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity
According to the literature, glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity is not responsible for the initial insult and neuronal loss
in the SNc, but is rather a secondary effect of dopaminergic
neurons susceptibility, molecular/bioenergetic defects as
well as altered neurotransmission associated with cell death
in this nucleus. The intrinsic vulnerability of dopaminergic
neurons, associated with mitochondrial impairment, inefficient antioxidant defenses and deranged proteolytic
machinery, represents the perfect background for the activation of Ca2?-mediated excitotoxic phenomena and
nigrostriatal death progression. Complex I inhibition was
shown to trigger accumulation of glutamate in astrocyte
primary cultures (McNaught and Jenner 2000). Also,
aggregated a-synuclein, the main pathological hallmark in
PD, was shown to increase the frequency of spontaneous
miniature synaptic currents mediated by glutamate receptors and to augment both pre- and post-synaptic

transmission, thereby aggravating the perturbation of
intracellular Ca2? homeostasis in neuronal cultures (Hüls
et al. 2011). Despite its physiological role is not clearly
understood, a-synuclein is thought to play a critical role in
the maintenance of the pool of synaptic vesicles and neurotransmitter release (Marques and Outeiro 2012; Lundblad
et al. 2012). Furthermore, in a transgenic mouse model of
PD, Price et al. (2010) reported that a-synuclein overexpression interferes with mGluR5 trafficking, by up-regulating their (expression) levels and enhancing their
excitotoxic action in the striatum, possibly as a result of a
concomitant increase in downstream signaling. Interestingly, in the same paper the authors also demonstrated
increased mGluR5 expression in the striatum of PD patients
(Price et al. 2010).
Finally, neuroinflammation and activated microglia,
which play a major role in the progression of SNc neurodegeneration, also contribute to glutamate release and
potentiate glutamate receptor-mediated responses (in particular NMDARs), thereby leading to the exacerbation of
excitotoxic phenomena (Barger et al. 2007; Noda and
Beppu 2013). On the other hand, increased levels of glutamate can activate microglia and sustain inflammatory
processes. In fact, it has been shown in the rat brain that
glutamate receptors, in particular AMPARs, Kainate
receptors and mGluRs (group I and III), are expressed on
microglia cells and their activation is responsible for
modulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Lee
2013). This evidence clearly suggests that neuroinflammation and glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity reciprocally
sustain each others and create a vicious cycle, which
eventually worsen nigrostriatal degeneration in PD.
In parallel, the loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal terminals and the resulting dopamine depletion contribute to
the re-arrangement of synaptic connectivity in the striatum,
which accounts for the development of PD pathology and
clinical features. Growing body of evidence indicates that,
in particular for glutamatergic neurotransmission, significant changes occur during the progression of the disease.
Changes in the levels of glutamate transporters (Salvatore
et al. 2012; Raju et al. 2008), as well as in the subunit
composition and phosphorylation pattern of NMDARs
(Dunah et al. 2000), were observed in the basal ganglia of
different animal models of PD; these changes varied
according to the degree of striatal denervation and loss of
endogenous dopamine. Both in animal models of PD
(Picconi et al. 2012; Gao et al. 2013) and in the brains of
PD patients (di Michele et al. 2013), loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons and striatal dopamine depletion locally
affect the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and synaptic plasticity (Fig. 1). These
changes are likely to affect the threshold for the induction
of glutamate and Ca2?-dependent synaptic plasticity in the

123

G. Ambrosi et al.

striatum. For example, a partial nigrostriatal denervation,
causing mild motor deficits in rats, affects NMDA-dependent LTP but not LTD and alters NMDAR composition in
the post-synaptic density, thereby compromising the optimal nigrostriatal circuitry organization and neurotransmission (Paillé et al. 2010).

Modulation of glutamate receptors in PD offers
beneficial effects on neuronal integrity, clinical motor
symptoms and L-Dopa-induced side effects
Several studies have shown that modulation of glutamate
receptors can prevent excitation and toxicity, thereby protecting neuronal viability and function (Santangelo et al.
2012; Hovelsø et al. 2012) (Table 1). Indeed, competitive
NMDAR antagonists have shown neuroprotective properties, though they cannot be adopted in the clinical practice
because of the severity of side effects associated with their
administration, in particular at the cognitive level (Lipton
2007). Therefore, weak antagonists of NMDARs have been
investigated. Kynurenic acid (KYNA), another intermediate of the kynurenine pathway, displays weak antagonistic
action on NMDARs and, to a lesser extent, on AMPA/

kainate receptors. Furthermore, KYNA was shown to
reduce glutamate release at synapses by inhibiting a7nicotinic cholinergic receptors, whose activation promotes
glutamate release at glutamatergic pre-synaptic terminals
(Zádori et al. 2011). On the same line, new strategies are
currently under investigation to develop neuroprotective
NMDAR antagonists (Koutsilieri and Riederer 2007).
These molecules would target specific NMDAR subunits
associated with excitotoxicity (e.g. NR2B) (Paoletti et al.
2013) or would be able to selectively interact with the
pathways downstream of NMDARs activation,to prevent
the intracellular responses that mediate excitotoxicity and
eventually neuronal death (i.e. calcium overload, ROS
production, bioenergetic changes and pro-apoptotic factor
release) (Paillé et al. 2010).
Furthermore, metabotropic glutamate receptors, in particular mGluR5, have been considered as alternative targets
for modulating glutamate hyperactivity in PD, primarily
because of the high expression of mGluRs in the basal
ganglia and their diverse modulatory roles (Duty 2012).
Indeed, mGluR5 and NMDAR are functionally coupled:
mGluR5 activate NMDAR by relieving Mg2? blockade
(Bruno et al. 2001) and NMDAR, in turn, amplifies the
activity of mGluR5 by preventing its desensitization

The role of excitotoxicity

(Alagarsamy et al. 1999). Several studies in animal models
of PD have demonstrated that the use of antagonists of
mGluR5 such as 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine
(MPEP) and 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl]pyridine (MTEP) represent a very interesting therapeutic
strategy in PD, in terms of neuroprotection and mostly in
the clinical management of symptoms and LIDs (Ossowska
et al. 2005; Armentero et al. 2006; Levandis et al. 2008;
Ambrosi et al. 2010).
Alternatively, the combined administration of glutamate
receptors modulators with molecules targeting other
receptors is also under investigation. For instance, the
administration of mGluR5 antagonist MPEP together with
antagonists of adenosine A2A receptors showed diseasemodifying properties in different rodent models of PD
(Coccurello et al. 2004; Kachroo et al. 2005). Also, agonists of cannabinoid receptors have been shown to interfere
with the glutamatergic neurotransmission in the striatum
(Huang et al. 2001), thereby suggesting a possible
employment of these molecules in PD-related drug
discovery.
Finally, other therapeutical approaches linked to the
glutamatergic system in PD have been reported in recent
studies showing that down-regulation or changes in the
composition of NMDARs and/or AMPARs in the basal
ganglia can be obtained after rasagiline and estrogens

administration suggesting that their neuroprotective
potential might rely on the suppression of glutamatemediated excitotoxicity (Gardoni et al. 2011; Al-Sweidi
et al. 2012; Liu and Zhao 2013). All these pre-clinical
studies opened the path to trials performed on PD patients.
These clinical trials were focused on the evaluation of the
effects of glutamate receptor antagonists on PD motor
symptoms and LIDs (Table 2). According to the results
collected so far, not many molecules succeeded in ameliorating PD motor symptoms, while some of them were
able to produce beneficial effects on the treatment of LIDs.

Concluding remarks
Nigrostriatal neurodegeneration that characterizes PD is
primarily due to the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic
neurons, nevertheless glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity
critically contribute to worsen neuronal loss in the SNc
because of the multiple afferents projecting onto this
nucleus and the distribution of both ionotropic and
metabotropic glutamate receptors within the basal ganglia
circuitry. The ultimate effect of excitotoxic phenomena is
activating apoptotic pathways through the disruption of
mitochondrial and bioenergetic homeostasis, as well as the
increase of intracellular Ca2? levels and oxidative burden.

Further information and details are reviewed in Meissner et al. (2011), Duty (2012), Johnson et al. (2009) and Gasparini et al. (2013). Clinical
trials with molecules not directly modulating glutamate receptors, but acting as inhibitors of glutamate release (e.g. safinamide and zonisamide)
are also reviewed in Meissner et al. (2011)

Interestingly, these same features are typical of PD pathogenesis, suggesting that glutamate-induced neurotoxicity
originates from and participate to a vicious cycle of neuronal death that lies on a generalized alteration of both
neuronal homeostasis and, on a larger scale, synaptic
connections in the nigrostriatal pathway.
The drug discovery process is being oriented toward the
development of new molecules and/or pharmacological
strategies targeting glutamate receptors, with the idea of
both slowing down the neurodegenerative process and
(re)establish a synaptic and neurotransmitter balance in the
basal ganglia circuitry. The future of this research might
have significant impact on the clinical management of the
disease and on patient quality of life.
