1. Introduction
Nurrl (nur-related factor 1, also known as RNR1, NOT,
HZF-3) and NGFI-B (nerve growth factor-inducible B,
also known as Nur77, NAK1/TR3, NIO) are two closely
related members of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor
family of ligand-activated transcription factors [6,11,15,22].
Since Nurrl and NGFI-B lack identified ligands they are
also referred to as ‘orphan receptors’. Additional receptors
with similarity to Nurrl and NGFI-B were recently identified in rat, C. elegans and Drosophila [10,16,23]. The
latter invertebrate orphan receptors demonstrate a remarkable evolutionary conservation of the Nurrl/NGFI-B subclass of steroid-thyroid hormone receptors.
The Nurrl/NGFI-B subgroup is unique within the large
family of nuclear receptors by being encoded by immedi-

ate early genes that are rapidly induced by various stimuli,
e.g., growth factors. Other immediate early genes, including c-~os and c-myc, are involved in critical processes
such as growth, differentiation and apoptosis in response to
external stimuli, suggesting that also Nurrl and NGFI-B
might play similar central roles in cell signaling. Indeed,
NGFI-B has recently been implicated in T cell apoptosis
and adenosteroidogenesis [14,25,26], even though recent
results indicate that there is no absolute requirement for
the presence of NGFI-B for apoptosis to take place [12].
No function has yet been described for Nurrl.
Nurrl and NGFI-B bind to specific DNA sequences
(response elements) in the vicinity of genes that they
regulate [4,15,20]. Several nuclear receptors, such as the
all-tram retinoic acid (RA) receptor (RAR), bind to such
DNA sequences as heterodimers with the receptor for 9-cis
RA (RXR) [13]. Nurrl and NGFI-B have been shown to
interact with DNA as monomers [25] but can also form
heterodimers with RXR and bind to similar response ele-

ments as those recognized by RXR-RAR heterodimers
[20]. However, whereas RAR prevents RXR from being
activated, RXR-NtuTl/NGFI-B heterodimers are highly
responsive to the RXR ligand, 9-cis RA [3,20]. Thus,
heterodimerization with Nurrl or NGFI-B shifts RXR
from a silent to an active heterodimerization partner. Being
encoded by growth factor-inducible immediate early genes,
the interaction of Nurrl and NGFI-B with RXR thus
provides a mechanism for cross-talk between vitamin A
and growth-factor signaling pathways.
As a first step towards understanding the function of
Nurrl and NGFI-B we have used in-situ hybridization to
analyze the spatiotemporal cellular distribution of their
mRNAs during embryonic and postnatal development and
in the adult. We find that these immediate early genes are
expressed in specific regions of the developing and adult

CNS. The data suggest that Nurrl plays a role in developing and adult CNS neurons including the dopaminergic
neurons of substantialnigra.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
A total of 22 mice (NMRI, Bomholt Breeding and
Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark) and 33 rats
(Sprague-Dawley, BtkK Laboratories, Sollentuna, Sweden) from different developmental stages (E13, E15, E18,
PO, P7, P14 and adult) were used. Pregnant females were
killed by cervical dislocation and embryos were removed,
staged (E15 and E18 decapitated) and fixed immediately in

Nurrl mRNA expression is seen within the medial neuroepithelium of the posterior neocortex, in ventral nuclei of the hypothalamus (HT) and in the
differentiating field of the developing pens. The distribution in this region suggests that the Nurrl message is specifically excluded from the trigeminal and
facial motor nuclei. C,D: Nurrl mRNA is found to be heavily expressed in the spinal cord. The dorsal root ganglion (G) is also included in this section,
and like all other peripheral ganglia, is negative. Thalamus (T), 3rd ventricle (V), central canal (CC). Scale bar = 350 pm.

cortex close to the developing corpus caflosum (arrowheads). More lateraIIy in cortex Nurrl mRNA-positive cells are also seen in the other corticat layers.
Very strong expression is also seen in subiculum (S) and the medial habenukn’nucleus. In thalamus (T) no expression of Nrrrrl mRNA is seen but a group
of cells in the area of the periventricular hypothrdamic nucleus in hypothalamus (HT) are Nurrl mRNA positive. Additionally, Nurrl-expressing ceils are
found in CA1 of the hippocampal formation (H) and scattered Nurrl mRNA-positive cells are seen in the lateral habenular nucleus (L) and the amygdatoid
complex (A). Scale bar = 1 mm.

4% paraformaldehyde, cleared overnight in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) and infiltrated with 20% sucrose
prior to cutting. Animals from postnatal stages were killed
by decapitation and tissues were rapidly frozen. Tissues
were sectioned at 10 p,m (embryonic) or 14 Lm (postnatal) and thaw-mounted onto slides (ProbeOn, Fischer).

binding to tissue components, As a positive control we
used the fact that hybridization with a TH-specific probe in
all cases generated the expected pattern of mRNA distribution.

2.3. In-situ hybridization
2.2. Probe preparation and specificity controls
Oligonucleotide probes complementary to nucleotides
1430–1477 in Nun-l mRNA [11], nucleotides 1191-1238
in NGFI-B mRNA [15] and 1441–1478 in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA [5] having no similarities to known
sequences, were synthesized (Scandinavian Gene Synthesis
AB) and radiolabeled with [35S]deoxyadenosine 5’-[athio]triphosphate (NEN) at the 3’-end using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Amersham). Specificity controls included: (1) use of a second probe complementary to
another part of the mRNA strand (1334–1381 for Nurrl
mRNA and 1272–1319 for NGFI-B mRNA). The patterns
observed with these complementary probes were always
identical; (2) Inclusion of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled
probe in the hybridization solution, in which case the
labeling normally obtained was completely absent; (3) use
of a 50 bp random probe, unique compared to known
sequences in Genbank, labeled with the same amount of
35S. This probe did not show any localized or specific

In-situ hybridization was performed according to Dagerlind et al. [2]. In brief, sections were hybridized for 16–18
h at 42°C in humidified boxes and rinsed 5 X 15 min in
1 X SSC at 55 or 60”C. Sections were then dehydrated,
air-dried, dipped in photographic emulsion (Kodak NTB-2,
diluted 1 : 1 in deionized water), exposed for 4–6 weeks at
–20°C, developed 4 min (D-19, Kodak), fixed 6 min
(mixture of Kodak 3000A and 3000B) and rinsed 30 min
in water before being lightly counterstained with Cresyl
Violet or Toluidine Blue and mounted (Entellan, Merck).
Sections were analyzed using light- and dark-field microscopy (Zeiss, Axiophot) and photographed (Kodak TMax 100).”The identification of CNS areas was guided by
published atlases [1,9,18,19]. Amount of specific labeling
was semiquantitively recorded using a scale with 4 steps:
–, (+), + and + +. Reliability and validity of this scale
was ascertained by the positive correlation obtained between individual animals, between rats and mice as well as
between observers.

2.4. 6-Hydroxydopamine

lesions

Rats were anesthetized and placed in a stereotaxic
frame. Eight micrograms of 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) in 4 I.L1of Ringer’s solution with 80 p,g of
ascorbic acid was unilaterally injected into the nigro-striatal
pathway [24]. Two rats were killed each after 1, 3 and 7
days and an additional six animals were taken 9 months
after surgery. The rats taken after 9 months were also
tested in a rotometer for apomorphine-induced (0.05

mg/kg, s.c.) rotational behavior to assure a complete
dopamine denervation [24].

3. Results
The expression of Nurrl mRNA was high in many
regions of the developing rat and mouse CNS and the
expression remained high in most of these areas into
adulthood. In contrast, only limited expression of NGFI-B

Fig. 3, Coronal sections of the newborn (C,D) and adult (A,B) rat brain at the level of caudate/putamen. Strong Nurrl mRNA expression is found in
cortical layer VI and in the area of claustmm and dorsal endopiriform nucleus, both in the newborn (C) and adult (A) brain. In (C) also note the scattered
Nrrrrl mRNA-positive cells in septum (S) and diagonal band (DB). B,D: Corresponding sections labeled with the NGITB-specific probe. In cortex (CX),
no NGFI-B mRNA expression is seen in the newborn animal (D) whereas a strong in-situ signal is found in most cortical layers in the adult rat brain (B).
The labeling in caudate/putarnen (CPU) is also strikingly different between the newborn and adult animals. Within the newborn caudate/putamen,
expression is seen in clusters (arrows in D) while in the adult rat striatum, NGFI-B-positive cells are scattered throughout the entire area. Scattered NGFI-B
mRNA-labeled cells are also seen in the pirifonm cortex (Pir) in the newborn rat brain. Due to the special oblique light illuminator (Zeiss) used instead of
an ordinary dark-field condensor to visualize Nurrl and NFGI-B mRNA expression in low-power magnifications, areas where cells are densely arranged,
as in the caudate/putamen neuroepithelium cpu, tend to refract light and appear labeled. This is also true for white matter like corpus callosum (CC).
However, no Nurrl or NGFI-B mRNA expression was observed in those areas. Scale bar= 500 ~m.

mRNA was seen in the prenatal CNS. At the time of birth
low NGFI-B mRNA expression appeared in small groups
of cells in striatum. The level of expression increased
postnatally in striatum and the transcript also appeared in
other regions. In the adult animal, NGFI-B mRNA was
found in several parts of the brain. Most cells that were
Nun-l or NGFI-B mRNA positive in the CNS appeared to
be neurons rather than glial cells. Nurrl mRNA was
mainly seen in the CNS, but the transcript was also found
in salivary glands and seminiferous tubules of the testis. In
contrast, NGFI-B mRNA was observed in several places
outside the CNS including: seminiferous tubules of the
testis, adrenal glands, glomerttli of the kidney, lung, salivary glands, skeletal muscle and nerves. Areas where
neither Nurrl - nor NGFI-B transcripts could be seen included liver and intestine. There were no major differences
between rats and mice except a somewhat lower labeling
using the NGFI-B probe in mice.
3.1. Rich prenatal expression of IVurrl mRNA
Nurrl mRNA was expressed across many regions of the
developing CNS, although as development continued, the
patterns of expression became progressively restricted to
more specific regions. However, where Nurrl mRNA continued to be expressed, strong labeling was always ob-

served. At E13, the Nurrl probe hybridized to cells in the
differentiating fields of thalamus, hypothalamus, the insular cortex, rhinencephalon and pretectum and labeling
extended down through isthmus, the pontine area, medulla
and spinal cord. There was also strong labeling in the
medial neuro-epithelium of both posterior neocortex and
medial pens (Fig. IA,B). In the latter case, labeling did not
extend to the neurons within the most ventricular layers. In
the spinal cord, labeling was divided into an extensive area
of expression within the marginal zone of the neuroepithelium and a more lateral labeling in the ventral region (Fig.
IC,D). No labeling for Nurrl mRNA was observed within
the cerebral cortex or hippocampus at this age, nor in the
peripheral nervous system at any prenatal age examined.
Within thalamus, labeling at E15 was restricted to the
medial and lateral habentdar nuclei and became further
localized to the medial habenular nucleus by E18 although
scattered cells could still be seen in the lateral nucleus.
Labeling within the insular cortex began to adopt its
postnatal pattern of being confined to regions of the future
claustrum and endopiriform cortex. At E15, Nurrl mRNA
expression was also found in the developing anterior cortex and was largely confined at this, and subsequent
embryonic ages, to the deepest layer of neurons of the
infragranular part of the cortical plate. There was no
labeling in the embryonic hippocampal formation until

scattered cells within the medial CA1. At E18, there was
also intense labeling within the ventral tegmental area and

over various brainstem nuclei, although matching of Nurrl
mRNA expression to specific individual nuclei was not
possible.

3.2. Almost no prenatal expression of NGFI-B
Prenatally, weak NGFI-B mRNA labeling was observed
within the choroid plexus and cranial nerves at E18. At all
other investigated ages and regions, no expression was
detected.
3.3. Postnatal expression of Nurrl and NGFI-B
Major findings are listed in Table 1 and/or shown in
Figs. 2–6. A more precise description of selected observations follows below.
3.3.1. O~actory bulb
Nurrl mRNA was seen in olfactory bulbs of newborn
pups in scattered cells in the glomerular layer. From P7,
Nurrl mRNA was also found in the mitral cell layer and in
the internal granular layer. Expression of NGFI-B mRNA
was found in this region in all cellular layers.
3.3.2. Neocortex
In the upper\medial parts of cortex at PO, P7 and P14
the transcript for Nurrl was found in neurons in the
developing layer VI and this expression persisted into
adulthood (Fig. 2, Fig. 3A,C and Fig. 5A). More laterally,
in the caudal parts of parietal cortex area 1 (Parl), in
insular cortex, in the whole area Par2 and in the perirhinal
and entorhinal cortex, the message was also found in the
other cortical layers. In the area of claustrum and the
dorsal endopiriform nucleus there was a strong labeling
which was also found later during development and in
adulthood. Thus, the neocortical Nurrl expression was
confined to deep layers in cranial, dorsomedial areas while
present in most layers of caudal, ventrolateral areas. NGFI-

B mRNA was not found in cortex until postnatal day 14, at
which time marked expression was found in many evenly
distributed neurons in all the cortical layers except in layer
I. The piriform cortex was also found to contain NGFI-B
expressing neurons. This pattern of expression was also
seen in the adult (Fig. 3B,D and Fig. 5B).
3.3.3. Caudate/putamen
NGFI-B was expressed in groups of cells in striatum in
a patch\ marginal zone manner in the newborn brain. This
‘patchy’ distribution disappeared later and in the P14 and
adult striatum NGFI-B rnRNA-positive cells were found
evenly distributed throughout the whole caudate/putamen
(Fig. 3B,D). The transcript for NGFI-B was also found in
the bed nucleus of stria terminals in the adult brain.
3.3.4. Hypothalamus
Nurrl mRNA-positive cells were found in a few cell
groups in postnatal rats. Most of these groups of neurons
were not confined to known neuroanatomical entities. The
labeling included parts of the posterior and lateral hypothalamic area, the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus and the
supramamillary nucleus. Additionally, Nurrl mRNA was
found in the adults in what appeared to be the premamillary nucleus.
3.3.5. Substantial nigral ventral tegmental area
Within this area Nurrl mRNA was found both during
development and in the adult animals(Fig. XII). The
adult distribution of Nttrrl mRNA in this region resembled
the distribution of the dopamine-containing neurons and
additional experiments with 6-OHDA denervated animals
supported this conclusion; 1 day after 6-OHDA, a decrease
in TH and Nurrl mRNA expression was seen on the

Fig. 6. Expression of Nurrl (A) and NGFI-B mRNA (B) in the spinal cord of newborn rats. Strongly Nurrl mRNA-labeled cells are found in small
(non-motor) neurons located in central parts of the grey matter. NGFI-B mRNA is found in nerve rootlets and in the dura mater. This expression is
probably confined to the Schwann cells. Scale bar= 500 p,m.

R.H.Zetterstromet al./Molecular BrainResearch41 (1996)111-120

affected side and this decrease was mainly restricted to the
ventral tegmental area. Three days after 6-OHDA only a
few TH and Nurrl mRNA-positive cells were seen on the
denervated side. Seven days and 9 months after 6-OHDA
treatment, TH and Nurrl mRNA could no longer be
detected on the lesioned side (Fig. 5E,F).
3.3.6. Brainstem
Nurrl mRNA was found adjacent to locus coeruleus (as
identified on adjacent sections with the TH mRNA-specific
probe) in what seemed to be Barrington’s nucleus. Nurrl
mRNA-expressing cells were also found close to the fourth
ventricle, medial to Barrington’s nucleus in the area of
central gray alpha and nucleus O. In addition, strong Nurrl
expression was seen in the motor nucleus of the vagus
nerve.
3.3.7. Spinal cord
In the newborn and P7 rat spinal cord distinct Nurrl
mRNA labeling was found in central parts of the grey
matter (Fig. 6A). In P14 and adult animals Nurrl rnRNA
could no longer be detected. NGFI-B mRNA-positive cells
were found in the dorsal and ventral nerve rootlets in
newborn rats (Fig. 6B).
4. Discussion
The present experiments demonstrate that Nurrl and
NGFI-B are expressed in highly specific patterns in the
CNS. Nurrl mRNA is found at many levels along the
neuraxis, while NGFI-B mRNA is confined to more rostral
areas, being absent from mesencephalon, pens and the
spinal cord. The temporal expression of Nurrl mRNA in
the spinal cord differs from that of other Nurrl mRNApositive areas by being present during the first weeks of
development but not later in life.
The relationship of Nurrl and NGFI-B to the dopamine
system is particularly intriguing. The match between the
distribution of Nurrl and TH mRNAs in substantial nigra
pars compacta and the ventral tegmental area of mesencephalon, suggests that Nurrl mRNA is expressed in
dopamine neurons. Strong additional support for such a
conclusion was derived from our experiments demonstrating that unilateral stereotaxic injections of a specific neurotoxin for dopaminergic nerve cells, 6-OHDA, leads to
rapid, complete and long-lasting disappearance of both TH
and Nurrl mRNA-containing neurons. While Nurrl mRNA
appears to be expressed in the dopamine neurons, NGFI-B
mRNA is expressed in the target area of these nerve cells
in caudate/putamen. During development of this brain
region, NGFI-B mRNA is present in patches and in a
marginal zone similar to the characteristic patch/marginal
zone distribution of the developing dopamine nerve terminals [17]. As striatum matures, the NGFI-B mRNA becomes more evenly distributed, consistent with the dense
and uniform dopamine innervation of the adult structure.

119

While Nurrl and NGFI-B mRNA appear to be mutually
exclusive in the cell body and target area of the nigrostriatal dopamine system respectively, they appear to coexist
in the olfactory bulb. This structure contains a form of
local dopamine circuitry in which both cell bodies and
terminals are present in the olfactory bulb itself. Therefore,
if expression in the olfactory bulb is also related to the
doparnine system, both orphan receptors would be expected to be expressed in this area.
Given that both Nurrl and NGFI-B appear to be related
to the dopamine system both in the nigrostriatal system
and in the olfactory bulb, it is interesting to note that other
members of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family,
such as the glucocorticoid and progesterone receptors,
have been shown to be activated by dopamine in the
absence of their ligands [21]. Such a regulatory potential
for dopamine could possibly be of physiological relevance
for the function of both Nurrl and NGFI-B in these brain
regions.
Nurrl and NGFI-B are encoded by immediate early
genes, and thus a variety of stimuli are able to produce
rapid up-regulation of their mRNA levels. Potassium-induced depolarization of PC12 cells is one such stimulus
[7]. Focal mechanical lesions of the brain can lead to
up-regulation of both receptors [8]. Excitatory epileptogenic treatments with pilocarpine similarly up-regulates
Nurrl and NGFI-B in a specific spatiotemporal pattern
(unpublished data). An additional possibility is that Nurrl
and NGFI-B operate by forming heterodimers with RXR
[3,20]. This mechanism may be only one of several ways
in which Nurrl and NGFI-B can function and it emphasizes the importance of comparing the distribution of the
two orphan receptors to that of the various RXR mRNA
species in the brain.
Several patterns of expression of Nurrl as well as
NGFI-B mRNA appear unrelated to dopamine neurons.
The striking expression of Nurrl mRNA in cortex, claustrum, as well as the pyramidal cell layers of hippocampus
and subiculum and the presence of NGFI-B mRNA in
cortex and hippocampus suggests that the two receptors
are also involved in higher CNS functions such as cognition and memory.
We conclude that the two closely related transcription
factors Nurrl and NGFI-B are expressed in the developing
and adult brain in patterns suggesting a role both in the
nigrostriatal dopamine system and in the cortices. The
presence of Nurrl in the dopaminergic nerve cells, represents a previously unknown constituent of those neurons
that degenerate in Parkinson’s disease.
