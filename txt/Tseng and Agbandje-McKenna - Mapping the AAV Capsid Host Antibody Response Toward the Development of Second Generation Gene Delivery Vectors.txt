The recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene delivery system is entering a crucial
and exciting phase with the promise of more than 20 years of intense research now realized in a number of successful human clinical trials. However, as a natural host to AAV
infection, anti-AAV antibodies are prevalent in the human population. For example, ~70%
of human sera samples are positive for AAV serotype 2 (AAV2). Furthermore, low levels
of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies in the circulation are detrimental to the efficacy of
corrective therapeutic AAV gene delivery. A key component to overcoming this obstacle
is the identification of regions of the AAV capsid that participate in interactions with host
immunity, especially neutralizing antibodies, to be modified for neutralization escape.Three
main approaches have been utilized to map antigenic epitopes on AAV capsids. The first
is directed evolution in which AAV variants are selected in the presence of monoclonal
antibodies (MAbs) or pooled human sera. This results in AAV variants with mutations on
important neutralizing epitopes.The second is epitope searching, achieved by peptide scanning, peptide insertion, or site-directed mutagenesis. The third, a structure biology-based
approach, utilizes cryo-electron microscopy and image reconstruction of AAV capsids complexed to fragment antibodies, which are generated from MAbs, to directly visualize the
epitopes. In this review, the contribution of these three approaches to the current knowledge of AAV epitopes and success in their use to create second generation vectors will
be discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are a promising gene delivery
vector system. They are small (~26 nm) non-enveloped viruses
belonging to the Parvoviridae, are assembled with T = 1 icosahedral capsid symmetry, and package a 4.7 kb single-stranded (ss)
DNA genome (1). There are over 100 AAV genomic isolates and 13
human and non-human serotypes described. These viruses have
different transduction efficiencies in different tissues dictated by
the capsid sequence (2). To date, no diseases have been associated with wild-type AAV infection. Further, AAVs can transduce
both dividing and non-dividing cells and sustain long-term gene
expression in non-dividing cells (3). All these properties make
them desirable vectors for therapeutic gene delivery.
Recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors, used in clinical trials, contain a desired transgene cassette flanked by two inverted terminal
repeats (ITRs) instead of the wild-type viral genome flanked by
these elements (4). In recent years, the AAV gene delivery system has been successfully utilized in several animal and human
clinical trials. In an ongoing hemophilia B trial, therapeutic levels of Factor IX protein has been maintained in patients for over
2 years with only one infusion of an rAAV8 vector packaging this
gene (5). In addition, rAAV2 vectors, encoding the retinal pigment
epithelium-specific 65 kDa protein, improved vision in Leber’s

congenital amaurosis (LCA) patients, without any significant side
effects (6–9). rAAV vectors have also been developed for the transduction of a variety of other cells in addition to liver and the eye,
including, as examples: brain cells for the treatment of Parkinson’s
disease (10) and Canavan disease (11); skeletal muscle for the treatment of emphysema, lipoprotein lipase deficiency, and muscular
dystrophy (12–14); and heart muscle for the treatment of heart
failure (15). Significantly, in 2012, an AAV1 vector, encoding the
lipoprotein lipase, was approved as a gene therapy treatment in
Europe (16), heralding a new era for this vector system.
However, despite the above successes, several obstacles must
still be overcome for full realization of the AAV vector system in
patient care and treatment. One of the most important of these
is pre-existing immunity. Serologic studies have shown that the
majority of the human population has been exposed to wild-type
AAVs (17–19). For example, the prevalence of anti-AAV antibodies in the human population has been reported to be ~40–70%,
with the most reactivity against AAV2, the most studied and best
characterized of the AAV serotypes. Although rAAV vectors used
for gene delivery do not carry viral genes and are unable to drive
viral protein synthesis, they are assembled from wild-type viral
capsid shells; thus, the host immune response to the vector can
be influenced by prior exposure to wild-type AAV. A pre-existing

antibody response against AAV can initiate an immune memory
response, which could impede gene delivery. For example, neutralization effects from pre-existing antibodies have been reported to
decrease transduction efficiency, even at low antibody titers (20–
22). For this reason, in the recent gene delivery trial for hemophilia
B, individuals with evidence of pre-existing AAV antibody immunity were excluded from participation (5). Thus, to develop the
AAV vector system into a more practical and efficacious gene transfer system, it is important to understand how antibodies interact
with the AAV capsid, especially to map dominant epitopes, both
neutralizing and non-neutralizing. With sufficient information on
the AAV antigenic structure, combined with data on capsid determinants of tissue tropism and transduction, it would be feasible to
design a neutralization-escaping vector, which can evade the host
antibody immune response while retaining desired tissue tropism
and transduction efficiency.
Here we will briefly review the AAV capsid structure and what
is known about the effects of its interaction with antibodies,
and then discuss example approaches utilized for mapping capsid
antigenic epitopes. The three most common approaches include:
directed evolution, an indirect method for obtaining the antigenic information through the selection of AAV variants under
antibody pressure; epitope searching, which utilizes peptide scanning, peptide insertion, or site-directed mutagenesis; structural
biology, namely cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional
(3D) image reconstruction (cryo-reconstruction), which directly
visualizes the antigenic sites on the capsid by 3D reconstruction of
capsid-fragment antigen binding (Fab) complexes.

AAV CAPSID STRUCTURE
The ~4.7 kb genome of the AAVs contains three open reading
frames (ORFs), rep, cap, and aap, flanked by two ITRs (~145 kb).
This genome is packaged into T = 1 icosahedral capsids that are
~26 nm in diameter. The cap ORF encodes three overlapping
structural capsid viral proteins (VPs): VP1, VP2, and VP3, in a
ratio of 1:1:10, which assemble the capsid. A total of 60 VPs assemble the capsid by 2-, 3-, and 5-fold symmetry-related interactions
(Figure 1). The VP3, the major capsid component, is able to assemble the capsid as long as the assembly activating protein (AAP)
encoded by the aap ORF, is present (23, 24). Three-dimensional
structures have been determined for AAV1-AAV9, the clade and
clonal isolate representatives of the over 100 genomic sequences
known for the human and non-human primate AAVs (2), by either
X-ray crystallography and/or cryo-reconstruction (25–32). In all
these structures only the VP3 common sequence is ordered. While
the AAVs have a sequence similarity that ranges from ~55 to 99%,
they are structurally very similar (33). The VP topology consists
of a conserved alpha helix (αA) and a eight stranded anti-parallel
(βB-βI) β-barrel core with large inter-strand loops (Figure 2A)
that form the exterior surface of the capsids. A comparison of
the AAV2 and AAV4 structures, two of the most distantly related,
identified nine common variable regions (VRs), designated VR-I
to VR-IX (Figures 2A,B), located on the capsid surface at the top
of the inter-strand loops (26, 34). The AAV capsid surface is characterized by depressions at the 2-fold axes (dimple), surrounding
a cylindrical channel at the 5-fold axes (canyon), and protrusions
surrounding the 3-fold axes (Figure 1). A wall or plateau is located

between the depression at the 2-fold axis and surrounding the
5-fold channel, the “2/5-fold wall” (Figure 1) (35). The VRs contribute to local topological differences between the AAV capsid
surfaces. For example, VR-II forms the top of the 5-fold channel;
VR-IV,V, and VIII form the top of the 3-fold protrusion and VR-VI
and VR-VII form their base; and VR-I, III,VII, and IX contribute to
the 2/5-fold wall (Figure 2B). The VRs also dictate functional differences, including receptor attachment, transduction efficiency,
and antigenic reactivity between the AAVs (26, 28, 30, 36–39).

AAV AND ANTIBODIES
All viral vectors are susceptible to the immune response from the
host (41). The most detrimental immune threat that AAV vectors encounter soon after administration is the B-cell mediated
antibody response (42, 43). Antibodies use their complementarity determining region (CDR), located on the end of Fab region,
to interact with antigens by specific surface complementarities
(44). This binding site, or “epitope,” is generally located on the
capsid surface of viruses. Antibodies against viruses may neutralize infectivity prior to viral attachment to host cell receptors,
or post attachment; interfering with internalization or fusion at
the cell surface, or during endosomal trafficking (45–48). Other
antibody neutralization mechanisms include antibody-mediated
phagocytosis, complement binding and activation, opsonization,
and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of infected
cells (49–52). As already stated above, in humans the prevalence
of AAV antibodies in healthy individuals is high and ranges from
~40–70% depending on serotype. Previous reports indicate that
the highest prevalence of anti-AAV immunoglobulin G antibodies in humans was for AAV2 (~60–70%) and AAV1 (~35–70%),
followed by AAV9 (~50%), AAV6 (~50%), AAV5 (~40%), and

as has been observed, for example, between AAV2 and AAV3
that are highly similar at the sequence level (55), and recently
for AAV1 and AAV5 which are disparate in at the sequence level
(56). Boutin et al. (17) showed that patients with a positive AAV2
serum response were also seropositive for AAV1, AAV5, AAV6,
AAV8, and AAV9 in 93, 52, 59, 57, and 58%, respectively, of the
samples tested. Thus a new generation of AAV vectors is needed
to circumvent the neutralization effects from pre-existing antibodies. The development of these new vectors will largely depend
on available AAV antigenic and structure information. To obtain
the antigenic information, three main approaches have been used.
These are discussed below.

AAV8 (~40%) [e.g., Ref. (17, 53)]. For the AAVs, neutralization
mechanisms have been described for only three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), A20 and C37-B against AAV2, which act at the
post-entry steps and receptor attachment, respectively (54, 55),
and ADK8 against AAV8, which acts at a post cell/pre-nuclear
entry step (37).
Given the reported detrimental effects of anti-AAV antibodies
on transgene expression, it is not surprising that the most successful applications of the AAV vector system have been in the eye and
brain, immuno-privileged sites when vector is directly injected,
or in patients with low or no anti-AAV antibodies titers prior to
vector administration. Furthermore, since the AAV capsid structures are similar, different anti-AAV antibodies may cross-react,

Without knowledge of AAV capsid biology, structure, or immunogenic sites, directed evolution serves as a strategy to generate
neutralization-escaping AAV variants. It is a high-throughput
molecular engineering procedure, which mimics natural evolution through iterations of genetic diversification under artificial
selection pressure (57). For generating neutralization-escaping
AAV variants, wild-type cap genes, from one or several AAV
serotypes, are mutated to generate a large genetic plasmid library,
which can generate numerous capsid variants through recombination during plasmid transfection. During viral infection with
viruses arising from the recombination process, a selective pressure, in this case antibodies, is applied. Only the variants that can
circumvent the antibody barrier presented to infect the desired
cells will transduce and drive progeny virus synthesis. The successful variants are then recovered and amplified for the next
round of selection. After several cycles of selection, additional
mutagenesis can also be introduced before further selection to
increase viral fitness (58). Comparison of the capsid sequences
of the final resulting variants and the wild-type input viruses
provides the antigenic information and the effect of the changes
on tropism and transduction efficiency. Generally, there are two
strategies to create the genetically diverse library, one is using
error-prone mutagenesis to randomize the capsid DNA sequences;
the other is to shuffle the DNA sequences of different AAV
serotypes.
ERROR-PRONE MUTAGENESIS

By a “sloppy” polymerase chain reaction (PCR), random point
mutations can be introduced into an ORF at a certain rate. Tuning the PCR conditions can also introduce a different number of
mutations into the target gene sequence (59). Perabo et al. (60)
used this approach to generate an AAV2 cap mutant library for
directed evolution under human sera selection. Approximately,
70% of the neutralization-escaping variants obtained contained
point mutations clustered on the external face of the capsid at the
3-fold protrusion (Figure 1). The two most frequently selected
mutations were amino acids 459 and 551 (Table 1) located in
AAV VR-IV and VR-VII, respectively (Figure 2). The variant
with the best neutralization escape capability carried the double
mutation R459K/N551D. The single (R459G or N551D) and the
double (R459K/N551D) mutant variants had comparable genome
packaging, infectivity, and particle titers to wild-type virus.
However, the N50 value, the amount of serum required to decrease

transduction by 50%, for R459G, N551D, and R459K/N551D were
4.1-, 3.3-, and 5.5-fold higher, respectively, than the corresponding
N50 value obtained for the wild-type AAV2.
Maheshri et al. (61) improved this strategy by combining the
error-prone PCR with a staggered extension process, which utilized a short time polymerase-catalyzed extension (64) to produce
AAV2 variants. Mutant capsids were next selected for infectivity in
HEK293 cells in the presence of a neutralizing rabbit anti-AAV2
serum. Nine mutants, which contained different combinations of
mutations at amino acid positions 12, 42, 117, 152, 180, 258, 418,
493, 567, 587, 713, or 716, had neutralizing titers that were 3-fold
higher than the wild-type virus (Table 1) (61). All the successful variants carried a T716A mutation. This residue is located on
the capsid surface at the 2/5-fold wall next to VR-IX (Figures 1
and 2B). One variant, r2.15, had a 96-fold improvement in transduction compared to wild-type AAV2 and the ability to mediate
moderate gene delivery at a low 1:2 serum dilution. This variant
has two mutations not present in the others: T567S and N587I.
T567S is in a minor epitope of the A20 MAb previously identified
by pepscan and peptide competition (55). Residue 587 is in VRVIII (Figure 2) and it is located proximal to residues involved in
heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) receptor binding in AAV2
(65, 66).
Maersch and colleagues (67) also used error-prone PCR to
establish an AAV2 cap library with the mutations focused only
on amino acids located in the 3-fold region previously identified
as being immunogenic: 449, 458, 459, and 551 (60), and 493 (61).
The directed evolution was carried in HEK293 cells under the
selection of neutralizing human serum. The resistance to neutralization of six resulting variants was compared to those of wild-type
AAV1, AAV2, and the double mutant R459K/N551D generated by
Perabo et al. (60). Two of the variants, with substitutions at 459,
493, and 551, outperformed the best variants from the previous
selections by Maheshri et al. and Perabo et al. (60, 61). This observation indicated that fine tuning single amino acid types on the
capsid surface can dramatically change the immunogenicity of
an epitope. Residue 493 is located in VR-V, which as previously
mentioned, together with VR-IV and VR-VIII form the top of the
protrusions surrounding the 3-fold axis. Thus the data from errorprone mutagenesis provides indications that the 3-fold region is
immuno-dominant in the AAVs.

DNA SHUFFLING

DNAse digestion followed by polymerase ligation can generate
a chimeric capsid variant from different AAV serotypes. Grimm
et al. (68) applied this method to randomly combine the cap
sequences from AAV2, AAV5, AAV8, AAV9, caprine AAV, avain
AAV, and bovine AAV prior to selection. They first selected capsid variants capable of human liver cell transduction and then
selected in the presence of pooled human anti-sera (Intravenous
immunoglobulin, IVIG). This strategy created a single chimera
named AAV-DJ. The amino acid sequence for AAV-DJ was closely
related to AAV2, AAV8, and AAV9 at 92, 88, and 85% identity,
respectively. Interestingly, the IVIG selection generated this variant with higher homology to AAV8 compared to variants selected
for human liver cell transduction alone, which were mostly similar
to AAV2. This implies that the IVIG selection pressure eliminated
variants with AAV2 epitope(s) from the resulting clones, consistent with the higher percentage of anti-AAV2 sero-prevalence in
the human population compared to other AAV serotypes. AAVDJ was capable of transducing mice passively infused with IVIG
prior to infection at low (4 mg) IVIG dose to similar levels as
parental AAV8 and AAV9 while AAV2 transduction was abolished
in either high (20 mg) or low (4 mg) IVIG dose. The AAV-DJ was
also inhibited at the high IVIG dose.
Another group, Koerber et al. (69), also generated chimeric AAV
capsids through DNAse I digestion and polymerase ligation which
displayed neutralization escape capability. The library was established from the cap ORF of AAV1, AAV2, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6,
AAV8, and AAV9. The selection was carried once in HEK293
cells to optimize just for infectivity without any antibody pressure. However, surprisingly, some IVIG neutralization-escaping
variants were generated. Four of the final seven chimeric capsids
obtained showed improved IVIG neutralization resistance compared to the parental serotypes despite ~90% sequence similarity.
Three of the variants that had higher resistance than the parental
AAV2 had a ~80 aa stretch from AAV9 or a V709I mutation and
the last C-terminal 19 aa from AAV6. The C-terminal stretch
contained a previously described AAV2 epitope, 697–716 (AAV2
numbering, see below) (62). One of the chimeras, cB4, was similar
to AAV1/6 at the sequence level, and had >400-, 8-, and 2-fold
resistance to IVIG neutralization compared to AAV2, AAV1, and
AAV6, respectively. While it was difficult to define which region

Tseng and Agbandje-McKenna

of this chimera dictated its strong immune evading ability, it contained a Y706H substitution. Both the Y706H and V709I changes
would be located in the 2/5-fold wall.
Other examples of chimeras selected for infectivity without
antibody selection which display increased antibody neutralization resistance have been reported. Li et al. (70) used iterative cycles
of infection to select variants with hamster melanoma cell tropism
started from a shuffled library constructed from AAV serotypes
1–9, except serotype 7. In this study, a specific chimeric AAV variant was isolated, containing residues 1–409 from AAV1, 410–450
from AAV8, 451–704 from AAV2, and 705–736 from AAV9. This
chimera, chimeric-1829, did not show any cross-reactivity to antisera from mice immunized with AAV1, AAV8, and AAV9. The sera
from mice immunized with AAV2 had some cross-reactivity to
chimeric-1829, but the neutralizing antibody (Nab) titer was 25fold lower than the titer for wild-type AAV2 (70). In another study,
Yang et al. (71) used DNA shuffling and in vivo selection to generate a muscle-cell targeting AAV chimera from serotypes 1–9 with a
different antigenic reactivity compared to the parental serotypes.
The mutant, M41, assembled from AAV1, AAV6, AAV7, and AAV8
sequences, showed a higher resistance to IVIG neutralization compared to AAV2. At a 1:64 dilution of IVIG, AAV2 infectivity
decreased to ~33%, whereas M41 infectivity still remained at 83%
compared to controls without IVIG incubation (71). The wildtype AAV8 infectivity remained at ~94% under these conditions,
suggesting that the sequence of M41 derived from AAV1, AAV6,
and AAV7, not those from AAV8, resulted in the increased susceptibility to IVIG recognition. This observation is consistent with
the fact that residues 410–450 contributed to M41 by AAV8 are
mostly internal in the capsid and form core β-strand regions of
the VP structure.

EPITOPE SEARCHING
Rather than viral evolution in the presence of antibodies to
obtain information on the antigenic regions of the capsid, epitope
searching focuses directly on the interaction(s) between antibodies and peptides generated from the capsid protein sequence
to map possible epitopes. This approach utilizes three main
strategies, peptide scanning, peptide insertion, and site-directed
mutagenesis.
PEPTIDE SCANNING

Moskalenko et al. (62) scanned the entire AAV2 capsid amino acid
sequence for potential epitopes using a total of 91 15-mer peptides that overlapped by five amino acids. The peptides were tested
for their ability to inhibit capsid binding by AAV2 neutralizing
human serum samples in an ELISA assay in which the peptides
were applied to an AAV2 capsid coated ELISA plate. This study
identified several overlapping peptides regions, two within the
VP1u sequence, 17–28 and 113–124, and six within the common
VP3 sequence, 241–260, 305–356, 401–420, 443–460, 473–484, and
697–716 (Table 1) (62). As already stated, there is no structure
available for the VP1u. The VP3 sequences are localized to βB,
strands βD-βE and the intervening loop that forms the 5-fold
channel including VR-II, strands βF-βG, the outer finger of the
3-fold protrusion that contains VR-IV, a strand region of the GH
loop, and the 2/5-fold wall that contains VR-IX, respectively, in the

VP3 crystal structure. The peptides containing residues 305–356,
401–420, 443–460 were considered the core neutralizing peptides.
A number of these peptides are located in VP regions that are
inside the capsids, and thus their ability to block capsid binding by
human serum likely reflects the polyclonal nature of the human
serum, which must include antibody responses to denatured VP
regions or fragments.
Wobus et al. (55) also used a peptide mapping strategy to
determine the epitopes of three mouse MAbs, A1, A69, and B1
previously reported to react against AAV2 (72, 73). An AAV2
cap gene fragment phage display library was screened with the
antibodies and positive clones were scanned for binding by the
antibodies, as overlapping 15-mer peptides on a membrane, and
further confirmed by peptide competition in a Western blot. Linear epitopes were mapped for A1 (residues 123–131) within VP1u,
A69 (residues 171–182) in the VP1/VP2 region and for B1 (residues
726–733) at the C-terminus of VP3. Consistently, these antibodies
react against denatured capsids. The epitopes for three conformational AAV2 directed antibodies, A20, C37-B, and D3 (55) were
also identified through a similar strategy. Overlapping 10-mer
peptides (covering the AAV2 capsid sequence) detected by the antibodies were confirmed by an ELISA assay. Multiple peptides were
identified for these antibodies consistent with their recognition of
the assembled capsid, although C37-B and D3 were also capable
of recognizing the VPs (55). The epitopes proposed for the three
MAbs were: 272–281, 369–378, and 566–575 for A20; 492–503 and
601–610 for C37–B; and 474–483 for D3 (Table 2). The A20 epitope residues are mostly located below surface loops containing
VR-I (for 272–281), the HI loop (for 369–378), and VR-V (for
566–575); the C37-B epitope peptides are located in VR-V (492–
503) and buried at the 3-fold axis (601–610), and the D3 epitope
is buried close to the 3-fold axis (474–483) (Figure 2B). As previously mentioned, the A20 MAb neutralizes virus infection at a
post cell entry step and the C37-B antibody inhibits HSPG receptor attachment by AAV2. The D3 antibody is non-neutralizing,
which is consistent with the mostly buried location of its mapped
epitope.
PEPTIDE INSERTION

Wobus et al. (55) attempted to further confirm the binding sites
for the A20, C37-B, and D3 antibodies as well as another antibody named C24-B using mutant AAV2 capsids onto which a 14
amino acid integrin binding ligand, L14, had been inserted. Prior
to the availability of the AAV2 capsid structure, Girod et al. (74)
utilized the 3D structure of canine parvovirus (75) to generate
a 3D homology model for AAV2, which was used for predicting potential capsid surface sites onto which this peptide could
be inserted for re-targeting AAV2 (74). Six such sites, 261, 381,
447, 534, 573, and 587, were identified. Testing of the antibody
binding properties of these insertion mutants with the A20, C37B, D3, and C24-B antibodies showed that the insertions at 261,

the sites do overlap with or are close to epitope regions mapped
using site-directed mutagenesis and structural biology as discussed
below.
Huttner et al. tested the ability of these six insertion mutants
to evade binding by human serum samples in an ELISA assay
(63). The A20 and C37-B antibodies were used as positive controls. Insertion mutations at amino acid positions 534 and 573
reduced human anti-sera binding, in 19/29 tested samples, by up
to 30% compared to the wild-type AAV2. Both of these residues
are buried inside the protrusions surround the 3-fold axis. Thus
their negative impact on serum binding is likely due to disruption of the surface loops that assembles the protrusions suggested
above to be important for antigenic reactivity for the AAVs. The
mutant with an insertion at position 587 only slightly impaired
serum binding in ELISA assays, but was able to transduce Hela
cells in the presence of human serum. The inserted L14 ligand also
enabled this mutant to infect B16F10 cells, a cell line which is nonpermissive to the parental AAV2, in the presence of human serum.
These observations are consistent with the fact that residue 587 of
AAV2 is located in a capsid region involved in immunogenicity,
e.g., the C37-B epitope, and cellular attachment, e.g., proximity to
the HSPG binding site (65, 66).

SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS

The best example of the use of site-directed mutagenesis for antigenic epitope mapping is provided by the study by Lochrie et al.
(38). This group used the crystal structure of AAV2 (32) to identify
sites for mutations on the capsid surface at amino acid positions
predicted to be potential antigenic sites based on the docking of
a murine IgG2a. All the mutants (57 alanine substitutions, 41
non-alanine substitutions) were screened for binding and neutralization ability with A20, three individual human serum samples,
and IVIG. The mutated positions that decreased neutralization by
A20 were 263, 264, 384, 385, 548, and 708. These residues are different to the amino acid stretches mapped by Wobus et al. (55) and
Hunter et al. (63), but are located structurally proximate to these
residues and are all clustered on the 2/5-fold wall (Table 2 and
Figure 1). The three human sera and IVIG screening identified
several epitopes (Table 1) due to the complexity of the polyclonal
response being tested. Different mutants showed resistance to different serum, and the mutations that resulted in neutralization
escape from the individual serum and IVIG were located over a
capsid region that was three times larger than an average Fab epitope footprint and spanned the 3-fold protrusions as well as the
2/5-fold wall. In addition, the ability to escape from human sera

Tseng and Agbandje-McKenna

and IVIG differed for some mutants. For example, mutant R471A
and mutant N587A were both resistant to all three tested human
sera, but mutant N587A was not resistant to IVIG neutralization.
Significantly, two A20 neutralization escape mutants, E548A and
V708A, also escaped neutralization by these sera, showing similarity in the murine and human immune response to AAV2. In
addition, AAV2 V708 is positionally equivalent to or proximal to
the V709 position in the chimera generated by Koerber et al. which
when mutated to an isoleucine (V709I) improves resistance to
IVIG neutralization (69).

STRUCTURE-BASED APPROACH
Cryo-reconstruction is a powerful technique for studying the
structures of macromolecular complexes, including viruses and
their complexes with receptors and antibodies. This method has
thus been applied for the study of AAV capsids bound to Fabs,
generated from MAbs, toward 3D characterization of the AAV capsid antigenic structure. Purified Fabs and AAV samples are mixed
and incubated prior to vitrification on an electron microscope
grid. For cryo-reconstruction, a large number of 2D projections
of the sample vitrified in native state, at different orientations, are
combined and processed to generate a 3D image reconstruction.
Current resolutions for AAV:Fab complex structures range from
subnanometer to ~20 Å. For identification of the antibody footprint, available atomic structures for the AAV capsids (35) and
homology models for the Fabs are fitted into the reconstructed
density map, in an approach termed pseudo-atomic model building, to provide the information on interacting sites. Below we
review the current AAV:Fab complexes and the antigenic sites
arising from these studies.
CRYO-RECONSTRUCTION OF AAV1/6:Fab COMPLEXES

AAV1 and AAV6 differ by 6/736 VP1 residues with 5/6 of them
located within the VP3 common region, are cross-reactive, and
belong to the same antigenic clade A (2), yet they differ in their
cellular tropisms pointing to a key role for the specific amino acid
differences in dictating these properties. The muscle tropism of
AAV1 has made it an attractive vector for several gene delivery
applications [see clinicaltrials.gov and (76)] and like AAV2, epidemiological studies show a high level of pre-existing anti-AAV1
immune response in the general population (17, 53). Efforts to
structurally map the antigenic structure of AAV1 have included the
cryo-reconstruction of AAV1 complexed with Fabs from two neutralizing mouse MAbs, AA4E4.G7 (4E4) and AA5H7.D11 (5H7)
(36, 56). These structures were determined to ~12 and ~23 Å
resolution, respectively. The proposed epitopes for the Fabs are
residues 456–459 (in VR-IV) and 492–498 (in VR-V) for 4E4 and
residues 494, 496–499 (on VR-V) and 582, 583, 588–595, and 597
(on VR-VIII) for 5H7 (Table 2). A structure of AAV6 complexed
with the 5H7 Fab, determined to ~15 Å resolution, identified a
similar footprint on the capsid. These epitopes are located on the
3-fold protrusions assembled from VR-IV and VR-VIII from one
VP monomer and VRV from a neighboring VP. The binding of
the Fabs occur in different orientations. 4E4 binds to the “outer
side” of the protrusion, with the long axis of Fab toward and across
the 2-fold axis. Steric hindrance limits the binding of this Fab to
just one at a time across the 2-fold axis, thus the occupancy is

www.frontiersin.org

Mapping AAV antigenic regions

0.5. 5H7 binds on the “inward facing side” of the 3-fold protrusion with its density centered at the 3-fold axis; hence, on average,
only one Fab can bind to a group of three protrusions, resulting
in occupancy of 0.3. Binding and transduction studies suggested
that these two antibodies neutralize infection by either competing
with cell surface receptor attachment or inhibition of a step post
cellular entry (56).
CRYO-RECONSTRUCTION OF AAV2:Fab COMPLEXES

For AAV2, which has broad tissue tropism and has been the vector most often used for clinical gene delivery applications (76),
the binding sites for the A20 and C37-B antibodies have also been
mapped by cryo-reconstruction (36, 39). These structures were
determined to 8.5 and ~11 Å resolution, respectively. The A20 footprint, determined by several approaches including pseudo-atomic
model building, includes residues 253, 254, 258, 261–264, 384, 385,
548, 556, 658–660, 708, and 717 (Table 2) (39). These residues
had some overlap with those previously described based on peptide insertion as well as site-directed mutagenesis (see above) but
extended the footprint to include additional residues (Table 2).
As stated above, when discussing the A20 epitope mapped by
site-directed mutagenesis, there was no overlap to the footprint
predicted by peptide scanning, but the residues are within the
same capsid region. Significantly, the binding site included residue
contributions from symmetry-related VP monomers, confirming
the conformational nature of the A20 epitope. The residues are
located in AAV VR-I and VR-III and the HI loop from one VP
monomer, and VR-VII and VR-IX from a second VP monomer.
The AAV2 C37-B footprint, based on a pseudo-atomic model built
into the cryo-reconstructed density map using the AAV2 crystal
structure and the structure of a generic Fab, includes residues
492–498 (on VR-V) from one VP monomer and 585–589 (on VRVIII) from another VP monomer (Table 2) (36). As already stated
above, this region of the 3-fold protrusion overlaps with the AAV2
HSPG binding site. This epitope overlaps with binding residues
determined based on peptide scanning and insertion (Table 2).
CRYO-RECONSTRUCTION OF AAV5:Fab COMPLEXES

AAV5 is one of the most divergent AAV serotypes with respect to
sequence and structure and is classified as a clonal isolate based
on antigenic non-cross-reactivity with other AAVs. As with the
other AAVs, efforts are underway to characterize its antigenic
structure because human sera also show pre-existing reactivity. While a number of mouse MAbs have now been generated
against the AAV5 capsid (56, 77), an antigenic footprint has only
been characterized for one, BB3C5.F4 (3C5), based on a structure reconstructed to ~16 Å resolution (36). The 3C5 MAb is
non-neutralizing, and the observation that both the variable and
constant regions of its Fab contact the capsid was suggested as
being possibly due to it being an affinity immature antibody (36).
This is because the MAb was generated only 4 days after AAV5 capsid immunization of a mouse that had been previously immunized
with AAV1 (56). The Fab density covered the majority of the capsid surface, with the exception of the 3-fold axis. Pseudo-atomic
model building into the reconstructed complex density identified two contact regions designated site A and site B with the
variable region being better accommodated in site B. This site

Mapping AAV antigenic regions

B region extended from the 2/5-fold wall toward the 5-fold axis
and included residues 246, 530, 532–538, 651, 653, 654, 656, 657,
704–708 (Table 2). These residues are structurally located in VR-I,
VR-VII, the HI loop, and VR-IX. Interesting, the site B footprint is
similar to that mapped for the A20 MAb against AAV2 (Table 2)
(38, 39, 55), despite AAV2 and AAV5 being highly antigenically
divergent (2).
CRYO-RECONSTRUCTION OF AAV8:Fab COMPLEXES

AAV8 has shown great promise as a liver tropic vector and is currently being utilized as the gene delivery vector in a clinical trial for
hemophilia B (5). While the patients selected to receive the Factor IX gene had little or no pre-existing antibody response against
AAV8, these patients have since developed an antibody response
and as such a repeat administration would require the use of an
alternative serotype or AAV8 variant with altered antigenic reactivity. The only information on the antigenic structure of AAV8
has been provided by a cryo-construction of this serotype complexed with a neutralizing antibody, ADK8 (23, 37). This structure
was determined to 18.7 Å resolution (37). The AAV8 crystal structure and that of a generic Fab were docked into the reconstructed
density to create a pseudo-atomic model of the complex. The footprint predicted from this model was confirmed by mutagenesis,
biochemical, and in vitro assays to be residues 586–591 located in
VR-VIII. This region is located on the inner face of the protrusions facing the 3-fold axis. The mechanism of neutralization by
the ADK8 antibody is currently unknown but occurs post cellular attachment and pre-nuclear entry (37). Significantly, an AAV8
vector mutated at residues 589–591 is capable of evading neutralization by ADK8 and retains the liver transduction efficiency of
the parental AAV8 vector in a mouse model (78). This study thus
provides a proof of the concept that AAV antibody binding sites
can be engineered to evade recognition while retaining the natural
parental transduction properties.

COMMONALITIES IN MAPPED AAV ANTIGENIC EPITOPES
The AAV antigenic epitopes mapped by the structural-based
approach show significant overlap among the AAVs despite differences in the amino acid types at these epitopes (Table 2). The 4E4
and 5H7 antibodies against AAV1 and C37-B against AAV2 have
epitopes that contain residues in the 492–499 peptide stretch while
epitopes for C37-B against AAV2 and ADK8 against AAV8 contain the 585–589 sequence stretch. As already mentioned above,
these residues are localized to the protrusions that surround the
3-fold axis (Figure 3). The epitopes of A20 and 3C5, which cover
the 2/5-fold wall and the floor of the depression, surround the
5-fold axis and share residues 254, 258, 261, and 708. With the
exception of the HI loop structure, which is conserved in all AAV
structures so far determined, the AAV antigenic epitopes mapped
by cryo-reconstruction are localized to VRs on the AAV capsid
surface (Figure 3) (26). This clustering of epitopes suggests a limited number of common antigenic regions on the AAV capsid
surface. Significantly, the 3-fold and 2/5-fold regions have been
implicated in antibody binding and neutralization for other parvovirus capsids including Aleutian Mink Disease Virus, Human
Parvovirus B19, Canine Parvovirus, and Feline Panleukopenia Virus

(79–83). These observations suggest a commonality in development of the host humoral response against parvovirus capsids,
which can inform on the antigenic regions of the AAVs. Thus
the epitopes presented here likely represent the capsid sites that
dominate antibody recognition by the AAV capsid.
While single mouse MAb footprints, as mapped by cryoreconstruction or peptide scanning/insertion may not be enough
to predict the antigenic repertoire of the polyclonal antibody
response present in human sera, the combined information from
several AAV:Fab complexes is proving to be predictive of the
antigenic structure of these viruses against the human immune
response. A comparison of the AAV MAb footprints identified
by cryo-reconstruction or for AAV2 also using peptide scanning,
peptide insertion or site-directed mutagenesis with the list of
antigenic sites obtained from screening capsid mutants against
human sera and IVIGs neutralization shows significant overlap
(Tables 1 and 2). For example, AAV2 residues 497, 498, 586, and
587, which when mutated enable AAV2 to escape from serum and
IVIG neutralization (Table 1) (38), are part of the C37-B MAb
epitope identified cryo-reconstruction (36) and peptide insertion
(63). The A20 MAb against AAV2, which had a expansive footprint, included escape mutant residues also identified by directed
evolution against rabbit serum and the screening of site-directed
mutants with human IVIG (Tables 1 and 2). The commonality
between AAV2 antigenic footprints and those for the other AAVs,
as mapped by cryo-reconstruction, for example C37-B with 4E4

Tseng and Agbandje-McKenna

and 5H7 against AAV1/6, C37-B with ADK8 against AAV8, and A20
with 3C5 against AAV5, suggests that a similar overlap will exist
between the footprints of these MAbs and the human polyclonal
response to their capsid.

PROS AND CONS OF ANTIGENIC MAPPING APPROACHES
The approaches discussed above have their own pros and cons.
Directed evolution, in the presence of human sera or IVIG, has
the potential to generate a selected AAV variant with the ability
to escape neutralization and retain its genome packaging capacity
and infectivity. In addition, a specific/desired tissue tropism can
be selected (70, 71, 84). However, this process is time consuming,
and unlike the rational approaches, the outcome is much harder
to predict. Peptide scanning and the structural-based approaches
focus on identifying epitopes first and then designing vectors to
escape antibody binding. Peptide scanning has the potential to
detect interactions from serum or IVIG which resemble the situation in the natural host. However, the epitopes detected are
mostly linear and may not represent the full repertoire of important pre-existing antibody interactions against the capsid unless it
has been uncoated, denatured, or digested. Thus this method has
limitations on footprint prediction accuracy. For example, peptide
scanning identified A20 epitope peptides that were adjacent to the
footprint identified by cryo-reconstruction and model building
but none overlapped (Table 2). In fact the peptides identified by
scanning were mostly located under the capsid surface VRs that
contained the epitope regions identified by site-directed mutagenesis and cryo-reconstruction. For C37-B, one of the peptides
mapped by scanning, residues 493–502, included the residues on
one of the amino acid stretches, 492–498, predicted to be within
the footprint by the cryo-reconstruction (Table 2). The other peptide identified by peptide scanning, 601–610, is buried inside the
capsid, and not predicted to interact with the antibody in the
reconstructed complex structure. Residues 585–589 predicted to
form part of the C37-B epitope by cryo-reconstruction was not
identified by peptide scanning. The structural-based approach,
either to confirm previously predicted epitopes, e.g., the AAV2:A20
and AAV2:C37-B complex structures, or to identify new epitopes,
e.g., the AAV1:4E4, AAV1:5H7, and AAV8:ADK8 complex structures, is able to accurately map antibody footprints. However,
to date, all the structures determined are for viruses complexed
with Fabs generated from mouse MAbs. This is because cloning
MAbs from human B-cells is challenging and structural studies
with polyclonal human antibodies could lead to poorly resolved
densities due to the variability in the sample. It could be argued
that the murine immune response differs from that of humans
and that human serum represents a polyclonal population of antibodies, and thus modification of single mouse MAb footprints
mapped by cryo-reconstruction studies may not generate vectors
that evade neutralization from human serum. To overcome this
bottleneck and mimic the polyclonal response, the structure of
each clinically relevant AAV complexed with Fabs from several
MAbs can be determined to obtain information on dominant
antigenic regions.
Given the advantages and disadvantages of the approaches
described above, a two pronged-attack, concurrent directed
evolution and structural mapping, is likely optimal for defining

www.frontiersin.org

Mapping AAV antigenic regions

the capsid surface antigenic properties of AAVs. The available 3D
structures for AAV1 to AAV9 provide the platform required for
the visualization of epitopes obtained by directed evolution onto
the parent serotypes. This can inform further modifications for
desired tropisms, on the background of an escape mutant, given
information on tropism determinants. Structural mapping will
provide information that can enable rational engineering of vectors for escape mutation while retaining natural tropisms. Thus
both strategies will delineate dominant epitopes for the AAVs.
The current data, using both approaches, point to the protrusions around the icosahedral 3-fold axis and 2/5-fold wall, as the
dominant targets for future modification for antibody escape.
Regardless of the method used to obtain the antigenic information, the ultimate goal is to create an AAV variant that can evade
the neutralizing effect of a pre-existing immune response and has
the capacity to effectively assemble genome packaged vectors and
retain efficient cell tropism. The observations described in this
review show that minor and local variations on the AAV capsid surface, including those due to single amino acid substitutions, may
alter more than one phenotype of AAV vector, including tropism
and antigenicity. The antigenic mapping data at hand, combined
with efforts at chemical capsid modifications, pharmacological
immuno-suppression, plasmapheresis, and saline flushing, point
to potential strategies for improving the clinical efficacy of this
promising gene delivery system.
