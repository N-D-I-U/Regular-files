Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) that can
cross the blood–brain-barrier and achieve efficient and
stable transvascular gene transfer to the central nervous
system (CNS) hold significant promise for treating CNS
disorders. However, following intravascular delivery,
these vectors also target liver, heart, skeletal muscle,
and other tissues, which may cause untoward effects.
To circumvent this, we used tissue-specific, endogenous
microRNAs (miRNAs) to repress rAAV expression outside the CNS, by engineering perfectly complementary miRNA-binding sites into the rAAV9 genome. This
approach allowed simultaneous multi-tissue regulation
and CNS-directed stable transgene expression without
detectably perturbing the endogenous miRNA pathway.
Regulation of rAAV expression by miRNA was primarily via
site-­specific cleavage of the transgene mRNA, generating
specific 5′ and 3′ mRNA fragments. Our findings promise
to facilitate the development of miRNA-­regulated rAAV
for CNS-targeted gene delivery and other applications.

Introduction
Gene transfer mediated by recombinant adeno-associated virus
(rAAV) holds promise for treatment of a large number of neurological disorders, but the blood–brain barrier blocks systemic vector
delivery to the central nervous system (CNS). Nonetheless, previous proof-of-concept clinical studies using intracranial injection
of AAV serotype 2-based vectors to the brain provided sustained
gene expression and therapeutic effects.1–4 Although localized vector
delivery may be effective in treating CNS disorders that map to well

defined anatomic and functional regions of the brain, the process
requires invasive neurosurgical procedures and, therefore, is costly
and potentially risky. If AAV vectors could cross the blood–brain
barrier and be specifically expressed in the CNS, intravascular delivery of rAAV would provide a more effective method for gene therapy
of CNS diseases that affect large areas of the brain and spinal cord.
Recent advancements in the discovery, rational design, and
directed evolution of AAV have created a collection of distinct
recombinant AAVs (rAAVs) appropriate for different gene transfer
applications.5 Among these vectors, rAAV6, rAAV8, and rAAV9
stand out for their ability to deliver genes transvascularly to target tissues.6–9 Intravascularly administered rAAV9 and some other
rAAVs with capsid modifications can cross the blood–brain barrier,
efficiently transferring genes to the CNS in mice, cats, and nonhuman primates.10–14 Nonetheless, several potential challenges remain
to using rAAV9 to treat CNS disorders. The first challenge is to
deliver rAAV specifically to the CNS. The viral capsid is the principal determinant for AAV tissue tropism,5 and the liver is the major
target for AAV vectors. Systemic administration of some rAAV
serotypes transduces the liver and other tissues, including the CNS,
skeletal muscle, heart, pancreas, and antigen-presenting cells.6,7
Such off-target transduction raises the specter of overexpression of
transgenes outside the CNS, potentially eliciting toxic responses.
Thus, the second challenge is to confine transgene expression to
the CNS when rAAV9 is delivered systemically. Historically, CNSspecific promoters have been used to limit transgene expression to
the CNS. However, tissue-specific, strong CNS promoters are often
too large to be packaged into the rAAV genome.
As an alternative, we used endogenous microRNAs
­(miRNAs) to suppress transgene expression outside the CNS.
miRNAs are small, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by post-­transcriptional silencing. miRNAs silence genes

Results
miRNAs efficiently repress reporter
gene expression in cultured cells
Endogenous miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing has proven to be an effective and tissue-specific approach to
regulate transgene or viral gene expression in vivo for plasmids,
viral vectors, or live, attenuated viral vaccines.16–21 To evaluate this
strategy for rAAV-mediated transduction, we introduced one or
three tandem copies of a perfectly complementary binding site for
miR-1 or miR-122 into the 3′ UTR of nLacZ in a rAAV plasmid
vector. We transfected the constructs into HuH7 cells, a human
hepatoma cell line expressing ~16,000 copies of miR-122 per cell,23
and measured the number of nLacZ-positive cells. The number of
nLacZ-expressing HuH7 cells for the one-site plasmid was about
half that of the no site control; three sites reduced the number of
nLacZ-expressing cells more than sevenfold (Figure 1a).
Molecular Therapy vol. 19 no. 3 mar. 2011

Next, we analyzed expression of the nLacZ constructs in
human embryonic kidney 293 cells, which naturally express
low levels of both miR-122 and miR-1, when miR-1 or miR122 was introduced as a pri-miRNA from a second plasmid.
We transfected 293 cells with the nLacZ reporter plasmids carrying 0, 1, or 3 miR-122 or miR-1-binding sites, together with
a plasmid expressing either pri-miR-122 (Figure 1b) or primiR-1 (Figure 1c). To vary the concentration of the miRNA,
we used either a low (1:3) or a high (1:10) molar ratio of the
nLacZ-binding site plasmid to the miRNA expression plasmid.
When miR-122 or miR-1 was introduced into the cells, nLacZ
expression was repressed only when the nLacZ reporter mRNA
contained the corresponding miRNA-binding sites; there was no
reduction of nLacZ-positive cells when miR-1 was coexpressed
with nLacZ containing miR-122-binding sites or when miR-122
was coexpressed with nLacZ containing miR-1-binding sites
(Figure 1b,c).

by two mechanisms. When partially complementary to mRNA
sequences, they typically reduce target mRNA stability and protein expression by two- to fourfold or less, a mode of regulation thought to tune mRNA expression.15 In contrast, when
miRNAs are nearly perfectly complementary to their mRNA
targets, they cleave the mRNA, triggering its wholesale destruction. miRNA-binding sites were first used in lentiviral vectors
to suppress transgene expression in hematopoietic cells, thereby
attenuating transgene immunogenicity.16 The strategy was subsequently used to regulate naked DNA-mediated gene transfer,
detarget oncolytic viral therapeutics from noncancer tissues to
reduce host toxicity, and, in another application, attenuate live,
attenuated virus-based viral vaccines to reduce toxicity in vaccine recipients.16–21 The use of miRNA detargeting poses special
challenges for systemic delivery of rAAV to transduce the CNS.
Intravascularly delivered rAAV for CNS-targeted transduction
requires suppressing high levels of rAAV expression in multiple
peripheral tissues even when transgene transcripts are successfully expressed in the brain.
Here, we report the use of miRNAs to detarget rAAV9 expression both separately and concurrently in the liver, heart, and skeletal muscle, the three tissues that are most efficiently targeted by
intravenously delivered rAAV9.7,8 Silencing of transgene expression in liver, heart, and muscle exploited the natural expression
of the abundant (≥60,000 copies/cell) miRNAs, miR-122, which is
expressed in hepatocytes, and miR-1, a miRNA found in the heart
and skeletal muscle of virtually all animals.22,23 miR-122-binding
sites have been successfully used to prevent hepatotoxicity of a
transgene from an adenovirus vector.18 Perfectly complementary
sites for miR-1, miR-122, or both were engineered into the 3′
untranslated region (UTR) of a nuclear-targeted, β-galactosidase
(nLacZ) reporter transgene whose expression was driven by a
cytomegalovirus-enhancer, chicken β-actin (CB) promoter. We
present multiple independent lines of evidence to show that the
miRNAs repress nLacZ expression by cleaving the transgene
mRNA at exactly the same site as by all Argonaute-bound small
RNAs in eukaryotic cells.24 When delivered systemically in vivo,
the miRNA-detargeted rAAV9 vector successfully expressed the
reporter transgene in the CNS, but not the liver or heart or skeletal
muscle.

miRNA Regulation for CNS-directed rAAV Expression

Tissue-specific endogenous miRNAs can
regulate expression of rAAV9 delivered
systemically in adult mice
To evaluate miRNA regulation of systemically delivered
AAV9CBnLacZ vectors in vivo, we produced AAV9CBnLacZ vectors carrying 0, 1, or 3 miRNA-binding sites perfectly complementary to either miR-122 or miR-1. The vectors were administered
by tail vein injection to adult male C56BL/6 mice at a dose of
5 × 1013 genome copies per kg (GC/kg) body weight. Four weeks
later, we examined the liver and heart of the transduced animals.
LacZ staining revealed that the nLacZ transgene was silenced by the
endogenous miRNAs in the cell type and organ in which they are
predominantly expressed: the transgene was specifically silenced by
miR-122 in the liver and by miR-1 in the heart (Figure 2a,b). While

nLacZ positive cells were reduced in the livers of the animals treated
with rAAV9CBnLacZ bearing one or three miR-122-binding sites,
nLacZ expression levels in the hearts of the same animals were similar to those in the animals treated with AAV9CBnLacZ bearing no
sites (Figure 2a). Similarly, nLacZ expression was not detected in the
hearts of the animals that received AAV9CBnLacZ containing one
or three miR-1-binding sites, but nLacZ expression in the livers of
the same animals was not affected as compared to that in the control
animal (Figure 2b). Our data suggest that the greater the number of
sites for a miRNA in rAAV, the lower the nLacZ expression in the
tissue where the corresponding miRNA is expressed (Figure 2a,b).
Next, we tested whether transgene silencing could be achieved
simultaneously in multiple tissues. We inserted different numbers of both miR-122- and miR-1-binding sites in the 3′ UTR
of the rAAV9CBnLacZ genome and examined their expression
in rAAV9 transduced mice. Histochemical staining of tissue sections showed that nLacZ expression was suppressed in both heart
and liver for rAAV9CBnLac containing one or three copies each
of the miR-1- and miR-122-binding sites, but nLacZ was readily
detectable in pancreas, where expression of both miR-122 and
miR-1 is low25 (Figure 2c). Quantitative, β-galactosidase assays
of homogenized liver tissue similarly showed that nLacZ expression was significantly lower when the transgene contained the
miRNA-binding sites (one miR-122-binding site: 7.8 ± 7.4%,
P value = 0.005; three miR-122-binding sites: 1.6 ± 1.0%,
P value = 0.005; one miR-1- plus one miR-122-binding site:
8.6 ± 5.7%, P value = 0.005; three miR-1- plus three miR-122binding sites: 3.1 ± 1.2%, P value = 0.005; three miR-1-binding
sites: 105.7 ± 11.6%) (Supplementary Figure S1).

miRNA repression of rAAV expression does not
perturb endogenous miRNA pathways
Highly expressed transgenes bearing miRNA-complementary
sites have been reported to promote degradation of the corresponding miRNA.26 We examined the levels of miR-122, miR-22,
miR-26a, and let-7 in rAAV transduced liver. We detected no difference in abundance of the four miRNAs among the three study
groups (Figure 3a). Moreover, our preliminary data from high
throughput sequencing analyses of small RNA from the livers of
one animal each from the three study groups show no change in
miRNA levels (data not shown).
Introducing miRNA-complementary sites into a highly
expressed transgene might also divert the corresponding miRNA
to the transgene mRNA from its natural targets, derepressing
them. We tested whether the miRNA-binding sites in the transgene transcripts would deregulate the expression of the known
endogenous target mRNAs of miR-122 or miR-1. We analyzed the
expression of cyclin G1, a miR-122 target in liver (Figure 3b,c)
and calmodulin, a miR-1 target in heart (Figure 3d). We detected
no significant alteration in cyclin G1 or calmodulin expression.
miR-122 regulates cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver, and agents
that block miR-122 function produce readily detectable changes in
serum cholesterol levels.27 We could detect no change in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, or low-density lipoprotein levels in mice 4 weeks after transduction with either control rAAV9
or rAAV9 expressing a transgene bearing miR-122-binding sites
(Figure 3e). We conclude that miRNA-mediated detargeting of

rAAV expression has no detectable effect on endogenous miRNA

Endogenous miRNAs silence rAAV transduction by
site-specific cleavage of transgene mRNA
To determine how miRNAs suppress expression of transgenes
delivered by rAAV in vivo, we characterized the transgene mRNA
in liver by conventional PCR (Figure 4b), quantitative reversetranscription PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 4c), Northern hybridization (Figure 4d,e), and rapid amplification of 5′ complimentary
DNA (cDNA) ends (5′ RACE; Figure 4f). When we used primers
that amplify the region between the 3′ end of nLacZ (A+F primer)
and the 5′ end of the poly(A) signal (A+R primer), an amplicon
that spans the miRNA-biding sites, we detected a 145 basepair
(bp) product after 26 cycles of amplification for the samples that

received control rAAV. An additional six cycles of amplification were required to detect a weak 220 bp band for the samples
transduced by rAAV containing three miR-122-binding sites.
These data are consistent with low levels of intact nLacZ mRNA
(Figure 4a,b).
To quantitatively assess the extent of the miRNA-directed
repression of the transgene transcripts, we performed qRTPCR using either oligo(dT) or random hexamer primers for
reverse-transcription and PCR primer pairs that span either a 5′
(nLacZ5′F/5′R), or 3′ (nLacZ 3′F/3′R) region of the nLacZ coding
sequence (Figure 4a). We examined the levels of nLacZ mRNA
with intact 5′ and 3′ ends in total liver RNA extracted from four
animals that received the control rAAV9CBnLacZ and four that
received rAAV9CBnLacZ containing three miR-122-binding
sites in the 3′ UTR. We observed reductions ranging from 3 ± 1

(random hexamer) to 7 ± 1 (oligo[dT])-fold in nLacZ mRNA
with an intact 3′ end in the animals that had received rAAV9
containing miR-122-binding sites, relative to the control. In contrast, we detected little or no decrease in nLacZ mRNA with an
intact 5′ end for the same samples using the 5′F/5′R primer pair
(Figure 4c). Our results suggest that the primary mode of turnover of the mRNA that has been cleaved by a miRNA is 3′-to-5′
exonucleolytic degradation.
To further characterize the fate of the transgene mRNA targeted by miR-1 or miR-122, we performed Northern blot analyses. A transgene probe binding to the 5′ end of nLacZ mRNA
detected a ~3.4 kb RNA in an animal injected with control
­rAAV9CbnLacZ, the expected size of the of the full-length nLacZ
transcript; a slightly larger band was detected in the liver sample
from a mouse treated with rAAV9CBnLacZ bearing three miR1-binding sites (Figure 4a,d). In contrast to the single transcript
detected for the rAAV9 expressing nLacZ bearing three miR-1binding sites, two RNAs of different sizes were detected for the
rAAV expressing nLacZ bearing three miR-122 sites (Figure 4d).

The lengths of these transcripts suggest that the longer transcript
likely represents the full-length mRNA, whereas the shorter, more
abundant transcript corresponds to 5′ fragments of nLacZ RNA
cleaved by miR-122 at the corresponding miR-122-binding sites
in the 3′ UTR (Figure 4d).
To confirm this finding, we repeated the Northern analysis
using an RNA probe spanning a portion of 3′ UTR of the transgene
mRNA. In addition to detecting full-length nLacZ transcripts in
the samples transduced by rAAV9 lacking miRNA-binding sites,
two closely migrating species smaller than the 281 nucleotide RNA
marker were detected. The size of these fragments is consistent
with miRNA-directed 3′ cleavage products of the nLacZ mRNA
(Figure 4e). These two 3′ cleavage products were also detected by
gel electrophoresis of the product from the 5′ RACE experiment
described below (Figure 4f).
To determine whether such target cleavage occurs in vivo when
the nLacZ transcript contained miR-1 or miR-122-binding sites, we
performed rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends (5′ RACE). Figure 5
presents the sequences of 21 clones recovered using 5′ RACE from

(Figure 5b) from the animals injected with rAAV9 in which the
nLacZ 3′ UTR contained three miR-1 and three miR-122-binding
sites. In liver, we detected the sequence signatures for miR-122­directed cleavage of the transgene mRNA at each miR-122-binding
site: 5% for the first binding site, 48% for the second binding site,
and 43% for the third binding site. All 5′ ends mapped to the phosphate that lies between the target nucleotides that pair with positions
10 and 11 of the sequence perfectly complementary to miR-122, the
precise site cleaved by small RNAs bound to Argonaute proteins in
all eukaryotes24 (Figure 5a). Similar results were obtained in the
heart for the miR-1 sites (Figure 5b).
Table 1 presents an expanded 5′ RACE analysis for additional vector groups. We note that none of the 5′ RACE products
sequenced corresponded to miR-1-directed site-specific cleavage in
liver or miR-122-directed site-specific cleavage in heart (Table 1).
Although no cleavage was detected within ­miR-1-binding sites

in the liver, some clones from heart were cleaved within the
­miR-122-binding sites, but not at the hallmark position for miRNAdirected cleavage.

Intravascularly delivered rAAV9 can be efficiently
controlled by endogenous miRNAs
Recent studies suggest that high doses of self-complementary AAV9
(scAAV9), delivered intravascularly efficiently transduce the CNS
in both mice and cats.11,12 However, intravenous administration of
such vectors also transduces liver, heart, and pancreas. We added
miRNA-1 and miRNA-122-binding sites into the scAAV9CB
enhanced GFP (EGFP) vector genome and injected 10-week-old
C57BL/6 male mice with 2 × 1014 GC/kg. After 3 weeks, we prepared 40 µm sections of brain and spinal cord and 8 µm sections
of liver, heart, and skeletal muscle and examined EGFP protein
expression. As reported previously,10–13 intravenously delivered
scAAV9CBEGFP efficiently transduced the CNS; EGFP was

readily detectable in the thalamus region of the brain and the cervical region of the spinal cord, but also in non-CNS tissues such as
liver, heart, and muscle (Figure 6a). In contrast, transgene expression in those non-CNS tissues was reduced when miR-1 and miR122-binding sites were included in the transgene; EGFP expression
was unaltered in the CNS, where miR-1 and miR-122 are not present (Figure 6a). We also used qRT-PCR to measure the differential
expression of the miRNA-repressed EGFP transgene in brain (41.2
± 7.7%), liver (3.0 ± 0.5%), heart (0.4 ± 0.1%), and muscle (1.3 ±
0.4%), relative to the EGFP transgene lacking miRNA-binding sites
(Figure 6b). To eliminate changes caused by variations in transduction efficiency between experiments, we normalized the data
to the number of vector genomes detected in the experimental
and control samples. Like the microscopic analyses of native EGFP
expression, the qRT-PCR data show that the presence of miR-122or miR-1-binding sites reduced transgene expression in liver (20fold), heart (100-fold), and muscle (50-fold), but did not detectably
alter transgene expression in brain.

Discussion
Discovery that rAAV9 can efficiently cross the blood–brain barrier
to deliver genes to the CNS represented a major advance toward
the goal of developing gene therapy for CNS disorders.12,14 Here,
we report that rAAV9 can be engineered so that endogenous miRNAs repress transgene expression outside the CNS. This strategy
532

provides another step toward the development of systematically
deliverable, CNS-targeted rAAV-based neurotherapeutics.
Recent advances in AAV vector development have substantially improved primate AAV vectors that achieve efficient and
stable transvascular transduction in multiple tissues simultaneously.6,7 For example, systemic delivery of rAAV9 achieves extensive and robust transduction of astrocytes throughout the CNS of
adult mice.11,12 This unique feature of rAAV9 promises to provide
a protective therapy for the degenerating neurons associated with
Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, by expressing neurotrophic growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor or glialderived neurotrophic factor in the transduced astrocytes.28 Yet,
non-CNS expression derived from the peripheral tissues transduced by systemically delivered rAAV9 could lead to long-term
circulation of super-physiological and potentially toxic levels of
those growth factors.29–31 Thus, in some applications, CNS-directed
gene transfer may also cause toxicity and immune responses if the
transgene is expressed outside the CNS.
Achieving transgene expression in only the target tissues is vital
for the clinical development of safe CNS gene delivery. Here, we
have shown that endogenous miRNAs can be harnessed to restrict
the tissue- and cell-type specificity of rAAV expression, as was
initially shown for lentiviral vectors.16 Our data demonstrate that
endogenous miRNAs can effectively repress transgene expression

brain, liver, heart and muscle to measure the amount of persistent vector
genome by qPCR and EGFP mRNA by qRT-PCR. (b) For each tissue, the
relative abundance of the EGFP mRNA containing miRNA-binding sites

miRNA-binding sites were designed based on the annotated miR-1 and

site in the 3′ UTR of the nLacZ expression cassette of the ubiquitously
expressed pAAVCB nuclear-targeted β-galactosidase (nLacZ) plasmid
using synthetic oligonucleotides (Figure 4a and Supplementary Table S1).
This vector uses a hybrid cytomegalovirus enhancer/CB promoter cassette
that is active in most cells and tissues. To express miR-122 and miR-1,
­pri-miR-122 and pri-miR-1 fragments were amplified by PCR from C57/
B6 mouse genomic DNA (Supplementary Table S1) and inserted into
the XbaI restriction site 3′ to a firefly luciferase cDNA in the pAAVCBFLuc plasmid. The identity of each pri-miRNA was verified by sequencing.
AAV9 vectors used in this study were generated, purified, and titered as
described.33

Cell culture and transfection. HEK-293 and HuH7 cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 100 mg/l of penicillin-streptomycin (Hyclone, South Logan,
UT). Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5%
CO2. Plasmids were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

in the periphery but not the CNS may enable the development of
safer, CNS-specific gene therapy vectors. In the future, validation

performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and

after rAAV9 injection and analyzed for total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein on a COBAS C 111 analyzer (Roche
Diagnostics, Lewes, UK). To evaluate endogenous miRNA-mediated,
CNS-restricted EGFP gene transfer, 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were
injected intravenously (tail vein) with AAV9CBnLacZ-[miR-122-binding

5 × 1013 GC/kg body weight) or scAAV9CBEGFP at 2 × 1014 GC/kg body
weight). Animals receiving nLacZ vectors were necropsied 4 weeks later;
8 µm cryosections of liver, heart, and pancreas tissues were prepared
for X-gal-histochemical staining. Animals that received EGFP vectors
were necropsied 3 weeks later and fixed by transcardial perfusion with
4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde. Brain, spinal cord, liver, heart, and muscle
were harvested for cryosectioning. Brain and cervical spinal cord tissue
were stained as floating sections in a 12-well plate using rabbit anti-EGFP
antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:500, followed by goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:400. Outside the CNS, EGFP expression
was detected directly by fluorescence. EGFP and antibody fluorescence was
recorded using a Nikon TE-2000S inverted microscope at ×10 magnification and an exposure time of 3 seconds for liver, heart, and muscle, and
5 seconds for thalamus (brain) and cervical spinal cord.
Vector genome quantification by qPCR. Genome DNA was extracted

from the selected tissues using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, West
Sussex, UK), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative
PCR were carried out in triplicate using 50 ng DNA and 0.3 µmol/l EGFPspecific primers (EGFP-F and EGFP-R) using GoTaq qPCR master mix
(Promega, Madison, WI) in a StepOne Plus real-time PCR instrument
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

qRT-PCR analysis. RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen), accord-

ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA (0.5–1.0 µg) was
primed with random hexamers or oligo(dT) and reverse-transcribed with
MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR
were performed in triplicate with 0.3 µmol/l gene-specific primer pairs
(nLacZ5′F/5′R, nLacZ 3′F/3′R, cyclinG1F/R and EGFP-F/EGFP-R) using
the GoTaq qPCR master mix in a StepOne Plus Real-time PCR device. The
specificity of qRT-PCR products derived from the 5′ and 3′ ends of nLacZ
mRNA was confirmed by gel electrophoresis.

Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was extracted from mouse liver
and analyzed by Northern hybridization.34 To detect nLacZ mRNA, a
618 bp fragment of nLacZ cDNA was isolated by NcoI and PciI digestion of pAAVCBnLacZ and labeled with α-32P dCTP by random priming (Takara, Shiga, Japan). To detect 3′ fragments of the cleaved nLacZ
mRNA, an 111 bp fragment of the poly(A) sequence in the vector genome
was cloned into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) for preparation of antisense
RNA probe labeled with α-32P CTP during in vitro transcription using the
Riboprobe System T7 kit (Promega). To detect miR-122, miR-26a, miR-22,
and let-7 or U6 in total liver RNA, small RNAs were resolved by denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Hybond N+ membrane
(Amersham BioSciences, Pittsburgh, PA), and crosslinked with 254 nm
light (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Synthetic oligonucleotides, 5′ end-labeled
with γ-32P ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs,
Beverly, MA), were used as DNA probes (Supplementary Table S1) and
hybridized in Church buffer (0.5 mol/l NaHPO4, pH 7.2, 1 mmol/l EDTA,
7% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate) at 37 °C. Membranes were washed
using 1× SSC (150 mM sodium chloride, 15 mM sodium citrate), 0.1%
sodium dodecyl sulphate buffer, and then visualized using an FLA-5100
Imager (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).
Western blot analysis. Proteins were extracted with radioimmunopre-

cipitation assay buffer [25 mmol/l Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mmol/l NaCl, 1%
(vol/vol) NP-40, 1% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) sodium
dodecyl sulphate] containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Boston BP,
Boston, MA). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford
method (Bio-Rad, Melville, NY). Protein samples, 50 µg each, were loaded
onto 12% polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham BioSciences). Briefly, membranes were
blocked with blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) at room

534

temperature for 2 hours, followed by incubation with either anti-GAPDH
(Millipore, Billerica, MA), anti-cyclin G1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA) or anti-calmodulin (Millipore) for 2 hours at room temperature.
After three washes with PBS containing 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween-20, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to LI-COR
IRDye for 1 hour at room temperature, and then antibodies detected using
the Odyssey Imager (LI-COR).
β-Galactosidase assay. Proteins were extracted with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and quantified as described above. Fifty micrograms of
protein was used for each β-galactosidase assay using the Galacto-Star System
(Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
5′ RACE. 5′ RACE was performed as described.35 The 5′ RACE Outer
Primer and the nLacZ gene-specific primer bGHpolyAR (Supplementary
Table S1) were used for the first round of nested PCR. The 5′ RACE Inner
Primer and the nLacZ gene-specific primer nLacZpolyR, which is located
near the stop codon of nLacZ cDNA, were used for the second round of
nested PCR (Supplementary Table S1). PCR products were TOPO-cloned
into pCR-4.0 (Invitrogen) and sequenced.
Statistical analysis. All results are reported as mean ± SD and compared
between groups using the two-tailed Student’s t-test.
