Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative
disorder with no proven neuroprotective or neurorestorative
therapies. During disease progression, degeneration of
dopaminergic neurons of the central nervous system occurs.
Therefore, therapies that either aim on the inhibition of this
degeneration or on the replacement of the degenerated
neurons are needed. On the one hand, arrest of degeneration
might be achievable through specific inhibition of disease
associated genes like α-Synuclein or Leucine rich repeat kinase
2 (LRRK2). On the other hand, based on neural stem cells
that bear the ability to generate new dopaminergic neurons,
replacement of degenerated cells could be accomplished.
Since both approaches can be regulated by micro-RNAs,
these molecules have an enormous therapeutic potential.
In this review, we will focus on the neurobiological and
neurodegenerative implications of miRNAs and highlight
their role in stem cell fate decisions. Finally, we will discuss
their potential as therapeutic agents and targets for Parkinson
disease.

tools. MiRNAs are found in multicellular as well as in unicellular organisms suggesting that these molecules and their regulatory function on gene expression are evolutionary conserved
elements.4 They are encoded by miRNA genes and transcribed as
“pri-miRNAs.” Processing of pri-miRNAs results in a 70-nucleotide hairpin termed “pre-miRNA”.5 Alternatively, pre-miRNAs
may be generated by splicing and debranching from introns of
protein encoding RNAs.6,7 Pre-miRNAs are processed by Dicer
into 20–25 nucleotide long duplexes. These mature miRNAs
bear a 6–8 nucleotide long sequence (called seed sequence) that
is fully or partially complementary to the mRNA transcript they
target (reviewed in ref. 8). The processing of pre-miRNAs by
Dicer is generally related to the recruitment of the Argonaute
(AGO) proteins9 leading to the formation of the RISC (miRNAinduced silencing complexes) and the downregulation of mRNAs
presenting the complementary seed sequence.10
This review will focus on the implication of miRNAs in the
physiological stem cell fate decisions as well as their role in the
pathophysiology and potential therapies of the neurodegenerative
disorder Parkinson disease (PD).

Introduction

Micro-RNAs in Brain Development

The central nervous system (CNS) is characterized by a high cellular diversity organized to form various anatomical regions with
different functions.1,2 During development nearly all brain cells
are generated by neural stem cells (NSCs). In the adult mammalian brain NSCs are located within the germinal regions of
the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the hippocampus.3
Since NSCs have the ability to generate any cell type of the
adult brain, they would be the ideal tool for regenerative cell
replacement therapies. This cell replacement may be mediated
either via transplantation of cells that have been expanded in
vitro or via utilization of endogenous adult NSCs. Alternatively,
strategies that do not lead to straight regeneration but block
neurodegeneration could be extremely beneficial. In principle,
considering both approaches—cellular regeneration and inhibition of degeneration—micro-RNAs (miRNAs), which function
as regulators of various cellular processes, are very promising

Through molecular profiling studies it became evident that certain miRNAs play specific roles in defined areas of the brain. In
particular, by microarray studies combined with RT-PCR and
LNA (locked nucleic acid)-based in situ hybridization techniques
the miRNAs miR-206 and miR-497 were demonstrated as being
enriched in the cerebellum, whereas miR-132, miR-212, miR-221
and miR-222 showed a strong enrichment in the forebrain.11,12
Additionally, several studies demonstrated that miRNAs may
further play an important role in defined subcellular compartments. For instance, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-204 and miR-221
are significantly enriched in the axons of superior cervical ganglia
neurons.13 On the other hand, it was demonstrated within the
E19 rat hippocampus that miR-26a is mainly located in the neural dendrites.14
Further evidence for miRNA implication in brain development was underlined by numerous studies where mice with a
brain-specific deficiency for the miRNA processing enzyme
Dicer display aberrant cortical, hippocampal and retinal development.15-20 Concomitantly, an embryonic Wnt1-cre mediated conditional knockout of Dicer leads to massive brain malformations,

Conditional knockout of Dicer within postnatal mouse brains
lead to abnormal mixed phenotypes such as hypoactivity,
decreased social behavior, ataxia and defects in rear limbs.22 The
brain of these knockout animals showed lowered weight and
decreased size of the cortex, the hippocampus and the cerebellum. In good agreement with these data, Kim and coworkers
demonstrated that post-natal loss of Dicer within postmitotic
midbrain dopaminergic neurons results in their progressive loss
and development of PD like symptoms.23 Taken together, these
studies show that particular miRNAs are indispensable for proper
brain development and may be involved in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative processes such as PD (summarized in
Table 1). Therefore, using miRNAs either to inhibit neurodegeneration or to foster stem cell based regeneration would be a very
promising therapeutic approach.
Micro-RNAs in Parkinson Disease
Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with an incidence of about 1% after the age of 65
y,24 increasing to 5.1% by the age of 85.25 The pathology of PD is
characterized by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons mainly in
the substantia nigra, which is usually accompanied by accumulation of protein inclusions called Lewy bodies. Loss of these neurons causes the typical PD associated clinical manifestations such
as bradykinesia, resting tremor and rigidity.24 Although PD was
first described by James Parkinson in 1817,26 the etiology of PD is
still incompletely understood. However, genetic studies led to the
identification of mutations in several genes that segregate with
the rare familial forms of the disease.27 For at least two of these
genes, α-Synuclein and Leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2),
interesting associations to miRNAs are described (summarized
in Table 1).
α-Synuclein—miR-7/miR-153/miR-433. α-Synuclein is a
140 amino acid protein that is widely expressed in the adult brain
with highest levels in the neocortex, hippocampus and substantia
nigra.28 There, it is mainly expressed in presynaptic terminals29
where it is speculated to associate with the plasma membrane30
and to be involved in the regulation of vesicle cycling and neuronal plasticity.31 Mutations within the α-Synuclein gene are associated with autosomal dominant familial PD. The three main
mutations are the A30P, E46K and A53T substitutions.32 The
overexpression of the human wild-type form (in addition to the
endogenous α-Synuclein) and the expression of these α-Synuclein
mutant forms are both characterized by a higher tendency to
form insoluble aggregates and thereby constitute the main structure of Lewy Bodies.33-37 Deposition of these aggregates results
in increased susceptibility of the affected neurons to oxidative
stress. However, the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon
is yet unclear.33,38-43 Furthermore, Bennett and coworkers demonstrated that mutant α-Synuclein is less efficiently degraded by the
proteasomal system than the wildtype form.44,45 Concomitantly,
the PD associated mutation A53T alters the ubiquitin proteasome
system.42,43

By utilizing several target prediction software tools, Junn and
coworkers searched for miRNAs that would target α-Synuclein
expression.46 MiR-7 was identified as promising candidate
especially because it is highly expressed in human, mouse and
zebrafish brains.11,47,48 This was further confirmed by the identification of potential miR-7 and miR-153 binding sites in the
3' UTR region of α-Synuclein.49 Accordingly, overexpression of
miR-7 and/or miR-153 resulted in a concentration dependant
decrease of α-Synuclein expression at the mRNA and protein
levels.46,49 MiR-7 and miR-153 directly interact with the 3' UTR
of α-Synuclein and genomic mutations within the seed sequence
abolish their post-transcriptional inhibitory effect. Moreover,
the effect of both miRNAs is synergistic; while miR-7 causes
a sustained translational inhibition, miR-153 exerts a transient
repression.49 However, these studies either used the neural cell
line SH-SY5Y or cultured cortical neurons but not dopaminergic
neurons. Therefore, in order to elucidate more clearly the effects
of miR-7 and miR-153 on PD, the exact role of both miRNAs in
dopaminergic neurons needs to be established.
In accordance with the observed effects of miR-7, its distribution in the mouse brain is significantly higher in the substantia
nigra, striatum and olfactory bulb when compared with brain
regions not involved in the pathogenesis of PD. In those regions,
its expression level is more than 40-fold higher in neurons than
in astrocytes. Similarly, miR-153 is mainly expressed in the midbrain region.49 Together, these data indicate that miR-7 and miR153 are preferentially expressed in cells where they can exert their
inhibitory action on α-Synuclein.28,46 This was further confirmed
by the observation that throughout brain development miR-7
and miR-153 have distribution patterns similar to α-Synuclein
mRNA and protein.49
As previously mentioned, both the expression of mutant
α-Synuclein or overexpression of wildtype α-Synuclein result
in Lewy Body formation, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and proteasome impairment.41-43,46 Through their
inhibitory action on α-Synuclein, miR-7 and miR-153 could
modulate α-Synuclein levels and hence protect cells against the
α-Synuclein induced deleterious events. Although inhibition of
α-Synuclein induced damages would not lead to regeneration,
treatment with miR-7/miR-153 could have a protective function
on the dopaminergic neurons of PD patients, at least by slowing
down disease progression. Consequently, miR-7 and miR-153 are
very promising therapeutic agents. An alternative way to counteract the deleterious effects of α-Synuclein could be via short
interfering (si) RNAs directed against the α-Synuclein mRNA.
Yet, off-target effects of the siRNAs should be taken into consideration. Furthermore, using miRNAs would probably modulate
several additional targets that might be as well involved in the
α-Synuclein induced pathology as well.
On the molecular level, it could be demonstrated that the
expression levels of α-Synuclein increase upon binding of FGF20
to the corresponding FGF-receptors.50-53 FGF20 is expressed
in midbrain dopaminergic neurons of rat brains50 as well as in
the substantia nigra of humans.54 Interestingly, FGF20 maps to
a PD linkage area located on chromosome 8.55 Concomitantly,

with this observation, inhibition of dLRRK by RNAi enhanced
Let-7 activity. The inability of an inactive kinase to inhibit Let-7
strongly suggested that the repressor activity of LRRK2 is mediated through its kinase function.62 In addition to Let-7, miR184* was also shown to be inhibited by pathogenic LRRK2. The
investigated target genes of these miRNAs are DP1 and E2F1
respectively. Consequently, LRRK2 transgenic flies showed an
upregulation of E2F1 and DP1 protein levels, which contributed
to the neuronal degeneration phenotype in the dLRRK (I1915T)
mutant flies. This provides possible insight on the use of Let-7
and miR-184* to counteract the function of mutant LRRK2 in
PD patients.
Transgenic hLRRK2 (G2019S) or dLRRK (I1915T) flies have
unchanged Let-7 expression levels. Therefore, LRRK2 is influencing miRNA activity not by changing the expression level but
by utilizing a different way of regulation. Strikingly, in the previously described flies, the expression level of the gene Brat was
affected. This is of prime importance because Brat, and its mammalian homolog TRIM32, have been described as activators of
certain miRNAs, including Let-7.63,64 Furthermore, TRIM32 is
an important regulator of stem cell differentiation.64,65 As will
be discussed below, stem cells and their differentiation into
dopaminergic neurons propose great potential for therapeutic
cell replacement strategies. Therefore it is necessary to establish
a solid link between miRNAs involved in PD pathology and
other factors that influence neural stem cell differentiation, as it
is the case with TRIM32 and Let-7. Thereby an interesting link
between PD pathology and potential stem cell based regenerative
approaches becomes evident (described below).
Other micro-RNAs. Screening for differentially regulated
miRNAs using microarray technology in the α-Synuclein (A30P)
transgenic mouse model for PD revealed significantly lower levels of the miRNAs miR-10a, miR-10b, miR-212, miR-132 and
miR-495. Additionally, using 2-D DIGE, expression levels of
two potential miR-132 target genes, namely sorting nexin-12
and an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, were elevated in the
mutant mice. The functional consequences of this observation
still remain open for investigation.66
Expression pattern analysis of miRNAs in the amygdala of
idiopathic PD patients showed more than 40% reduction of
miR-34c in 9 out of 11 patients.67 Also the expression of DJ1
and Parkin, two additional proteins associated with PD, was significantly decreased upon miR-34b/c depletion in these patients.
This indicates that miR-34b/c may indirectly regulate the levels
of both proteins. Interestingly, differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells
into dopamine like neurons correlate with increased miR-34b
and 34c expression, suggesting that they might also play a role in
the development and physiology of these neurons.67
In order to identify PD relevant miRNA-gene interactions
as well as novel genes or pathways implicated in PD development Santosh and coworkers performed a computational study
to create an interaction map between miRNAs and PD associated genes. Twenty-nine genes involved in PD pathogenesis
were selected from Parkinson disease pathways described in the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) as well as
in literature resources. Then the miRanda software was utilized

van der Walt and coworkers could show a correlation between
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FGF20 gene
and susceptibility to PD. Two of these SNPs (rs1721100 and
ss20399075) are located within the 3' UTR region of the FGF20
gene and could therefore play a role in differential binding abilities of regulatory miRNAs.55
Wang and coworkers examined samples from about 700 white
Caucasian families with both PD affected and unaffected individuals excluding all Parkin-mutation carriers from this study. In
addition to the previously detected SNPs, this study identified
four new 3' UTR SNPs which are located within the genomic
region of FGF20 and associated with increased risk for developing PD. One of these SNPs (rs12720208) lies within a possible
binding site for miR-433 of the FGF20 gene. This SNP results
in the exchange of one Cytosine moiety (C allele) to a Thymine
moiety (T allele). The differential binding of miR-433 either to
the C or to the T allele of this SNP results in inhibition or activation of FGF20 translation, respectively.53 Examining expression
levels of FGF20 in three human brains carrying either the C or
the T allele demonstrated that the T allele homozygous brains
had significantly higher levels of the FGF20 protein.53 Altogether,
mutations in the 3' UTR region of the FGF20 mRNA result in a
failure in miR-433 binding. Consequently, the expression levels
of FGF20 are increased and therefore the susceptibility to develop
PD is higher.53,55 However, it is important to note that other
studies failed to replicate this association. For instance, samples
from Greek, Finnish and Spanish populations could not relate
the described SNPs to an increased risk for developing PD.56,57
Additionally, even no nucleotide variations in the miR-433
sequence itself were identified among the Spanish patient samples.57 So it seems that effects and consequences of different SNPs
and the resulting interaction with miR-433 may differ between
groups of different ethnic origins or genetic backgrounds.
LRRK2—let-7/miR-184*. Leucine rich repeat kinase 2
(LRRK2) is the most commonly reported gene to be involved in
PD.36 The LRRK2 protein consists of several domains, including
leucine rich repeats, mitogen activated kinase and a Roc GTPase
domains. LRRK2 is highly expressed in the brain, with hippocampus and striatum showing the highest expression levels.58,59
The role of LRRK2 under physiological conditions is yet not
clear but mutations in the functional domains of this protein
have been strongly associated with PD. The main mutations,
I1122V, R1441C, R1441G, Y1699C, G2019S and I2020T are
linked to both autosomal dominant and sporadic forms of PD.
The G2019S mutation is the most commonly reported one and
lies within the kinase domain, leading to enhancement of the
kinase activity.60 This mutation results in inhibition of peroxidase phosphorylation leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and
oxidative damage.61
A comprehensive study conducted by Gehrke and coworkers utilized the Drosophila model to elucidate whether LRRK2
can influence miRNAs or vice versa. Indeed, LRRK2 was able
to decrease the activity of the miRNA Let-7. LRRK2 proteins
carrying the human G2019S [hLRRK2 (G2019S)] or the drosophila equivalent I1915T LRRK2 [dLRRK (I1915T)] mutation
showed even a higher inhibition of Let-7 activity. In correlation

that are lost in the course of neurodegenerative diseases.69,70
Additionally, with the advent of the induced pluripotent

replace degenerated cells.71 An imaginable strategy would be
to make use of patient specific fibroblasts, which can be reprogrammed into iPSCs and further differentiated into NSCs

alternative strategy it is conceivable
to employ endogenously present

are strongly expressed in hESCs and their expression level rapidly declines upon initiation of differentiation.85,86 Furthermore, a
regulatory circuit of the factors Oct4-Nr2f2-miR-302 in hESCs
controls the balance between pluripotency and neuronal differentiation.87 Under maintenance conditions Oct4 and its downstream
target miR-302 suppress the expression of Nr2f2 at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. However, upon induction of
differentiation, Nr2f2 inhibits expression of the pluripotency factor
Oct4 and induces neuronal commitment by increasing the expression of pro-neuronal factors such as Pax6, Six3, Zic1, N-cad and
Lhx2.88 This example demonstrates that, via regulation of numerous protein coding genes, miRNAs play an important role in the
maintenance of the pluripotent stem cell state.
Micro-RNAs in stem cell differentiation. ESCs have the
ability to give rise to NSCs, while NSCs can generate neurons.
During this commitment the cell type specific transcriptome has
to transit toward the transcriptome of a more differentiated cell
type. Various studies analyzed these transitions with regards to
miRNAs48,88-90 (Fig. 1 and Table 1). In the following section we
will focus on four miRNAs that are particularly well characterized in this context.
Micro-RNA-9. MiR-9 is an important control element in the
brain development of various species.91 In mice, miR-9 controls
the development of the telencephalon by repressing numerous transcription factors such as Nr2e1, REST, Gsh2, Meis2,
BAF53a and Islet1.92 Furthermore, by regulating Foxg1 expression levels miR-9 is important for the differentiation of CajalRetzius cells.93 In good agreement with its function during brain
development miR-9 levels increase dramatically during neuronal
differentiation of ESCs.94 Additionally, electroporation of miR-9
in NSCs of the embryonic mouse brain leads to abnormal neuronal differentiation.95

During neuronal differentiation NSCs that are characterized
by the neural-progenitor-specific BAF complex have to switch
toward the neuron-specific BAF complex.96 MiR-9, miR-9* and
miR-124 (see below) target BAF53a, an element of the neuralprogenitor-specific BAF complex, which is, after mitotic exit,
replaced by BAF53b an element of the neuron-specific BAF
complex.97 Interestingly, expression of these three miRNAs was
sufficient to reprogram human fibroblasts directly into neurons97
(Fig. 1). Collectively, these in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate the importance of miR-9 during neuronal differentiation.
Micro-RNA-124. The miR-124 is the most enriched miRNA
in the mouse brain and is associated with multiple neuron-specific
molecular functions.98 Strikingly, transfection of non-neuronal
HeLa cells only with miR-124 induces the switch toward a transcriptome that is highly similar to a typical neuronal expression
profile including high expression levels of neuronal genes and
simultaneous repression of transcription of non-neuronal genes.99
During brain development and with advancing neuronal
differentiation the expression levels of miR-124 are constantly
increasing.100 During adult neurogenesis NSCs (so called type
B-cells) have low levels of miR-124. While the cell progresses
toward a more fate-committed neuronal cell type, i.e., by transiting through the stages of transient amplifying cells (so called
type C-cells) and neuroblasts (so called type A-cells) the levels of
miR-124 continue to increase.101 To further evaluate the role of
miR-124 during neurogenesis, Cheng and coworkers performed
a knock-down experiment using modified miR-124 oligonucleotides. Such downregulation of miR-124 led to an increased
number of type C and A cells.102 At the molecular level miR124 induces neuronal differentiation by negatively regulating the
Notch pathway which is of importance for NSC maintenance.103
Additionally, miR-124 is also targeting the transcription factor

immature form of Let-7 miRNA. However, upon induction of
differentiation, Let-7 and lin-4 expression levels increase which
results in downregulation of their target gene lin-28 and thus in
the transition toward differentiated neurons.123
The fact that expression of Let-7 increases during neuronal differentiation is in good concordance with the findings that Let-7a
is activated through TRIM32, an inducer of neuronal differentiation.64,65 Furthermore, recent observations highlighted that
Let-7b, another member of the Let-7 miRNA family, targets the
stem cell regulator TLX and the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1.124
It was further demonstrated that Let-7b overexpression leads to
simultaneous repression of stem cell maintenance and activation
of neural differentiation. On the other hand, repression of Let-7b
strongly inhibited neuronal differentiation. Together, these data
show that members of the Let-7 miRNA family are, in collaboration with cell fate determinants such as TRIM32, of prime
importance for the induction of neuronal differentiation.
Micro-RNAs in dopaminergic fate specification. Therapeutic
approaches aiming on the replacement of neurons lost during PD
depend on the generation of dopaminergic neurons from neural
stem cells (Fig. 1). Also in this specific differentiation process
miRNAs play important roles.
In mice, the Wnt1-cre-mediated conditional knockout of
Dicer resulted in numerous developmental brain defects.21 More
specifically, this knockout led to a lack of miR-124, miR-9 and
miR-218 expression and a strong impairment of midbrain dopaminergic neuron development. Moreover, miRNA expression
profiles generated from PD patients show significantly lower levels
of miR-133b when compared with profiles established from unaffected individuals.23 In two mouse models for PD, i.e., the Pitx3
deficient “Aphakia mice” and the 6-OHDA injected PD model,
expression of miR-133b is dramatically reduced. In fact, within
dopaminergic neurons Pitx3 specifically induces transcription of
miR-133b which in turn downregulates Pitx3 expression at the
post-transcriptional level.23 Thereby a regulatory feedback loop is
established. These data suggest that maturation and maintenance
of dopaminergic neurons is controlled by miR-133b.
Together, the here discussed studies demonstrate that, beyond
others, miR-9, miR-124, miR-128, miR-133b and Let-7 are of
prime importance for governing NSC maintenance and neuronal
differentiation. By these means they could be used as basis for
setting-up a cell replacement strategy designed to cure neurodegenerative diseases such as PD (Fig. 1).
Micro-RNAs as Diagnostic Markers
Besides their use as therapeutic agents miRNAs could find a useful application as diagnostic markers. Indeed, their tissue specificity and dynamic expression in response to external stimuli
makes them promising biomarkers to monitor particular events
(summarized in Table 1). Additionally, their stability within
the blood plasma renders them even more applicable as common diagnostic markers in routine clinical tests. Nowadays with
the emergence of very sensitive analytical techniques even very

Sox9 and thereby facilitates cell cycle exit.102 Finally, by targeting Cdc4, and thus influencing the sub-cellular localization of
Rac1, miR-124 further stimulates neurite outgrowth.104 Together,
these data strongly suggest that miR-124 is a major control element in the regulation of adult neurogenesis within the subventricular zone.
This is further supported by the observations that after focal
cerebral ischemia miR-124 is downregulated and allows expression of the Notch ligand Jagged-1 as well as the Notch receptor.
Hence, proliferation of NSCs is supported.105 Also in spinal cord
contusions an implication of miRNAs in molecular repair mechanisms has been described. Microarray studies revealed that up to
32 miRNAs, including miR-124, were downregulated, whereas
SNORD2 (small nucleolar RNA, C/D box 2; predicted as being
important for ribosome-associated translation initiation106),
miR-223 and miR-21 showed increased expression levels.107
Interestingly, the repression of miR-21 was shown to cause apoptosis in NSCs.108-110 Thus the upregulation of miR-21 together
with activated neurogenesis probably allows an increased number
of newborn cells to survive and to induce regeneration.107
Micro-RNA-128. Besides miR-9 and miR-124 also miR-128
has been identified as a brain-specific miRNA.111 It is highly
expressed in neurons while this transcript is nearly absent in glial
cells.112,113
MiR-128 potentiates its impact on gene regulation by targeting the nonsense-mediated RNA decay machinery.112 Nonsensemediated RNA decay is a regulatory mechanism that targets
transcripts with premature termination codons and thus protects
the cell from deleterious effects that may result from truncated
proteins.114 The impact of nonsense-mediated RNA decay on
proper brain development is underlined by the fact that mutations of UPF3B, a core gene of this mechanism are causative of
various neurological disorders such as intellectual disability,115
schizophrenia and autism116 as well as mental retardation.117
Recently, miR-128 function was associated with nonsense-mediated RNA decay malfunction by targeting two of its key factors,
namely UPF1, an RNA helicase, and MLN51, a core protein of
the EJC (exon-junction complex).112 The ability of miR-128 to
repress nonsense-mediated RNA decay in a brain specific manner
may correlate to its brain specific expression pattern.111 Therefore,
it is highly suggestive that this “nonsense-mediated RNA decay
miR-128 circuit” acts specifically within the nervous system and
leads to upregulation of transcripts that are involved in processes
like neural differentiation, maturation and function.112
Let-7. The development of Caenorhabditis elegans is coordinated by a hierarchical and time dependent organization of
specific genes.118 Some elements of this gene cascade are tightly
controlled by the two regulatory miRNAs, namely lin-4 and
Let-7.119,120 In their study, Reinhart and coworkers120 showed that
aberrant expression of these miRNAs has a direct impact on the
expression levels of the protein coding genes lin-28, lin-14, lin41, lin-42, daf-12 and hbl-1 which in turn are important regulators that ensure the transition from early to later developmental
stages.120-122
In undifferentiated cells lin-28 binds the pre-Let-7 transcripts, inhibits the processing by Dicer and thereby stabilizes the

Perspectives—Therapeutic Approaches
and Applications
MiRNA based therapeutic treatments for PD may follow two
different strategies. The first one could be to use the miRNA

associated target-gene-specificity in order to downregulate the
expression of the aberrant gene within the cell of interest. The
second approach would be to use miRNAs to direct NSCs differentiation in the desired direction (e.g., in the case of PD toward
dopaminergic neurons) (Fig. 1). For both approaches miRNA
overexpression (gain-of-function) as well as repression (loss-offunction) are conceivable.
Gain of function of specific miRNAs may be achieved by using
“miRNA-mimics.”131 These molecules resemble pre-miRNAs
and lead to the downregulation of the desired gene. One challenge is to ensure that the miRNA-mimics are delivered to the
right cell. Another challenge of this approach is to avoid off-target
effects by downregulating unintended target genes. Additionally,
when considering treatment of neurological diseases, the bloodbrain-barrier has to be overcome. An interesting tool able to manage numerous of these obstacles are exosomes.132 Upon injection,
these vesicles may cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver the
cargo to the brain cell of interest.133 Furthermore, gain of function therapies may be confronted with the problem of finding the
right level of expression of the miRNA in order to avoid overloading the miRNA bio-processing machinery.
Loss of function of the miRNA of interest may be achieved
by different approaches. One approach consists of synthetic
sponge mRNAs containing a complementary sequence to the
seed sequence of the miRNA of interest. Expression of these
sponge mRNAs leads to sequestration of the miRNA.134 Another
approach directing the downregulation of endogenous miRNAs
is the use of antagomirs. These chemically engineered oligonucleotides have a specific, efficient and long-lasting effect on the
expression levels of the targeted miRNA.135 However, because
they couple to cholesterol they are unable to cross the blood brain
barrier. Nevertheless, direct injection into the brain region of
interest was able to attain the desired effect.136 Both approaches,
i.e., sponge mRNA and antagomirs, might be limited by the
fact that different miRNAs are characterized by the same seed
sequence and thus non-pathological miRNAs may be sequestered
as well. LNA (locked-nucleic acids)-antimiRs are an additional
way to inhibit the function of miRNAs. LNAs are conformational RNA analogs with the ability to exert high and specific
binding to complementary miRNAs. In a recent study, Elmén
and coworkers applied a LNA-antimiR antagonizing the liverexpressed miR-122 to African green monkeys. This resulted in
the formation of stable heteroduplexes between the LNA-antimiR
and miR-122 in the cytoplasm of primate hepatocytes causing
the depletion of mature miR-122 and yielding a dose-dependent
lowering of plasma cholesterol levels. Importantly, no evidence
for LNA-associated toxicities or histopathological effects were
observed.137 The use of various chemical compounds may block
expression of particular miRNAs as well. For example, a lowdose administration of Paclitaxel has been shown to downregulate expression of miR-192 and thereby attenuate renal fibrosis in
a rat model of remnant kidney disease.138
In conclusion, the discussed studies demonstrate the increasing knowledge of miRNA’s role in disease origin and progression as well as in stem cell fate specification. This understanding
opens numerous perspectives on how these molecules could

levels after different kinds of toxic treatments or within stroke
models.125 Interestingly, the brain specific miR-124 was undetectable in the plasma of healthy rats; however, shortly after induced
stroke miR-124 levels strongly increased in the plasma.126 In this
study, the authors could not identify a significant correlation
between the size of the induced infarcts and miR-124 expression levels in the plasma. Additionally, the reason why miR-124
concentration increases in the plasma while it is repressed in the
affected brain area105 remains to be elucidated. Nonetheless, this
observation might be of significant medical importance since
reliable and accessible blood markers for early diagnosis of brain
infarcts are missing.
A miRNA-microarray study performed on human brain traumata patients in comparison with healthy volunteers indicated that
the plasma levels of particular miRNAs are statistically different.127
In particular, it was shown that miR-16, miR-92a and miR-765
are reliable markers of severe traumatic brain injuries with perfect
specificity and sensitivity. However, within mild traumatic brain
injury patients the expression level of miR-765 were unchanged
whereas levels of miR-92a and miR-16 were significantly increased.
Studies analyzing the miRNA plasma levels of stroke patients demonstrated a statistically significant increase of miR-210 levels.128
Moreover, the plasma isolated miRNAs miR-34a, miR-449a, miR564, miR-432, miR-548d, miR-572 and miR-652 showed strong
upregulation in schizophrenia patients.129
A recent study confirmed that miRNAs may also be usable
as diagnostic markers for PD. It was shown that patients not
receiving any symptomatic therapy displayed decreased expression of miRNAs miR-1, miR-22* and miR-29a when compared
with healthy control individuals.130 In the course of this study
another cohort of PD patients received the Dopamine agonist
Levodopa. When treated and non-treated patients were compared, the increased expression of miR-16-2*, miR-26a2* and
miR-30a upon Levodopa uptake became evident. These results
would suggest that treatment with Levodopa not only improves
the motor-functions of patients, but also the miRNA expression
profile is changed. Based on these interesting results a better
understanding of the miRNA directed pathophysiology of PD as
well as of the molecular downstream effects of Levodopa treatment are probably within reach.
Together these data show that plasma levels of specific miRNAs may reflect pathological conditions. Specificity of these
miRNAs as diagnostic makers still has to be confirmed in differential analysis of various disease types and not only in comparison to the expression profiles of healthy individuals. Nevertheless,
the discovery that plasma levels of certain miRNAs can serve as
biomarkers for pathological conditions is very recent. Taking into
consideration the availability and stability of miRNAs as well as
the reliability of these early results, such approaches seem to be
extremely attractive as future diagnostic techniques.
