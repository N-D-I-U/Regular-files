Background: Although previous study has demonstrated that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in the
­antidepressant-like effect of oleanolic acid, there is little information regarding the details of the molecular mechanism involved in this effect. Methods: We used a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model to test the antidepressant-like effect of oleanolic acid on
­depressant-like behaviour, miR-132 expression and synaptic protein expression in the male mouse hippocampus. Furthermore, we explored the possible signalling pathways associated with miR-132 expression that mediate the effect of oleanolic acid on neuronal proliferation. Results: The results demonstrated that a 3-week treatment with oleanolic acid ameliorated CUMS-induced anhedonic and anxiogenic behaviours. Furthermore, we found that oleanolic acid led to the BDNF-related phosphorylation and activation of extracellular
signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB), which was associated
with the upregulation of miR-132 and hippocampal neuronal proliferation. Moreover, experiments with an miR-132 antagomir revealed
that targeting miR-132 led to inhibition of neuronal proliferation and the postsynaptic density protein 95, but did not affect presynaptic
protein synapsin I. Limitations: Several other stimuli can also induce CREB phosphorylation in the hippocampus. Thus, regulation of
miR-132 may not be restricted to neurotrophic signalling. Conclusion: Our results show that oleanolic acid induces the upregulation of
miR-132, which serves as an important regulator of neurotrophic actions, mainly through the activation of the hippocampal BDNF–ERK–
CREB signalling pathways.

Introduction
Depression has become an increasingly prevalent health
problem throughout the world. It is generally assumed that
multiple mechanisms are responsible for the development of
depression. Although clinical and experimental studies are
providing some insight into the pathophysiological processes
that may occur in depression, recent analyses have indicated
that approximately 30% of depressive patients failed to respond satisfactorily to commercially available antidepressants in monotherapy.1 A growing body of evidence supports
that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its
­tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) are involved in
the pathophysiology and treatment of depression.2,3 They
play a critical role in the modulation of some functions, such
as neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic responses to

neurotransmitters, which are closely related to antidepressant therapy.4 Either reduced BDNF availability or decreased
expression of the TrkB receptor could reduce BDNF–TrkB
signalling.5 In contrast, treatment with antidepressants could
upregulate BDNF or activate the TrkB receptor in the brain.6,7
In addition, in an animal model of depression, the results
demonstrate that antidepressant efficacy is mediated at least
in part through an elevation of BDNF levels or BDNF–TrkB
signalling in the hippocampus.8,9 In contrast, in transgenic
animals with decreased brain BDNF levels or inhibited
BDNF–TrkB signalling, antidepressant agents fail to exert behavioural responses.10,11 Collectively, these studies indicate
that stimulation of the BDNF–TrkB signalling pathway could
provide a novel approach to the treatment of depression.

ules (about 22 nucleotides) found in plants and animals that

function in the regulation of gene expression. Dysfunctional
microRNA-mediated regulation has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of many disorders, including diseases of the
central nervous system. Neural miRNAs are involved at various stages of synaptic development, including dendritogen­
esis, synapse formation and synapse maturation. In mammals, miR-132 is enriched in neurons. The role of miR-132 in
neuronal outgrowth and synaptic function is currently being
­studied. It has been suggested that the expression of miR-132
is induced by neurotrophins, such as BDNF,12,13 and this may
represent a mechanism of fine-tuning the protein expression
following neurotrophic stimulation. 14 Specifically, by decreasing the levels of p250GAP, a guanosine triphosphatase
activating protein linked to neuronal differentiation, miR-132
promotes neuronal outgrowth and brings about an increase
in synaptic protein levels.15,16
Oleanolic acid, a pentacyclic triterpene, has been reported
to induce serotonin (5-HT) secretion17 and alleviate cerebral
ischemic damage.18 Our previous study also demonstrated
that BDNF was involved in the antidepressant-like effect of
oleanolic acid.19 However, there is little information regarding the details of the molecular mechanism involved in these
effects. We therefore investigated whether the administration
of oleanolic acid would lead to enhanced BDNF-related miR132 expression in a mouse model of chronic unpredictable
mild stress (CUMS) and thereby explored the major intracellular pathways activated by oleanolic acid treatment.

Methods
Animals
Male ICR mice (24 ± 2 g; 5 weeks old) were purchased from
Shanghai Slac Animal Center, China. Animals were housed 8
per cage (320 × 180 × 160 cm) under a normal 12-hour light/
dark schedule with the lights on at 7 am. The animals were allowed 1 week to acclimatize to the housing conditions before
the beginning of the experiments. Ambient temperature and
relative humidity were maintained at 22 ± 2°C and at 55 ± 5%,
respectively, and the animals were given free access to standard chow and water for the duration of the study. All proced­
ures were performed in accordance with the published guidelines of the China Council on Animal Care (Regulations for the
Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals,
approved by the State Council on Oct. 31, 1988, and promulgated by Decree No. 2 of the State Science and Technology
Commission on Nov. 14, 1988). Each experimental group consisted of 8 mice, and the present study involved a total of
208 mice. All procedures were approved by the Institute for
Ex­peri­mental Animals of Huaqiao University.

Chemicals
We obtained oleanolic acid (purity = 98.4% by high-­
performance liquid chromatography) from Shanxi Huike Botanical Development Co., Ltd. Fluoxetine hydrochloride and
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were purchased from Sigma, and
K252a was purchased from Alomone Laboratories. The miR-

132, U6 primers and related miRNA reagents were purchased
from RiboBio Co., Ltd. The anti-BDNF antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The antibodies for
BrdU and synapsin I were purchased from Millipore. The
­inhibitor U0126, and the antibodies for extracellular
­signal-regulated kinases (ERK)-1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, cyclic
adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein
(CREB), phospho-CREB and postsynaptic density protein 95
(PSD95) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The
anti–glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
antibody was purchased from Kangcheng Biotech.

Drug administration
For the test of the behavioural and miR-132 regulations, the
mice were randomly divided into 14 groups: 7 control groups
and 7 CUMS groups that received vehicle (0.9% physiologic
­saline); 20 mg/kg of fluoxetine (20 mg/kg); or 2.5, 5, 10, 20 or
40 mg/kg of oleanolic acid, respectively. Oleanolic acid was
suspended in saline with 10% (v/v) Tween-80, and fluoxetine
was dissolved in 0.9% physiologic saline. Oleanolic acid and
fluoxetine were administered by oral gavage. The doses chosen
and the administration method were based on the behavioural
results and previous reports.19
To observe whether TrkB receptor activation is required
for miR-132, we randomly divided the mice into 4 groups:
the control-vehicle group, the CUMS-vehicle group, the
CUMS-oleanolic acid group (20 mg/kg) and the CUMS-­
oleanolic acid+K252a group (20 mg/kg+25 µg/kg). We dissolved K252a in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and saline
and injected it intraperitoneally in a volume of 10 mL/kg
body weight. The dose of K252a was selected based on previous studies.20–22
To ascertain whether ERK activation is a major contributor
to miR-132 regulation by oleanolic acid, we randomly div­
ided the mice into 4 groups: the control-vehicle group, the
CUMS-vehicle group, the CUMS-oleanolic acid group
(20 mg/kg) and the CUMS-oleanolic acid+U0126 group
(20 mg/kg + 0.4 mg/kg). We dissolved U0126 in 0.1% DMSO
and saline and injected it intravenously in a volume of
10 mL/kg body weight.23,24
The drug treatment was performed once daily for the last
3 weeks of the experiments.

Chronic unpredictable mild stress
We performed the CUMS procedure as described previously.25 Briefly, the weekly stress regime consisted of food
and water deprivation, exposure to an empty bottle, exposure to a soiled cage, light/dark succession every 2 hours,
space reduction, 45° cage tilt, overnight illumination and
predator sounds. All stressors were applied individually and
continuously, day and night. The control animals were
housed in a separate room and had no contact with the
stressed animals. To prevent habituation and ensure the unpredictability of the stressors, all the stressors were randomly
scheduled over a 1-week period and repeated throughout the
7-week experiment. On the basis of their sucrose preference

following 4 weeks of CUMS, both stressed and control mice
were divided into matched subgroups.

Sucrose preference test (SPT)
The SPT was carried out after 4 weeks and 7 weeks of CUMS
exposure. Briefly, before the test, the mice were trained to
adapt to sucrose solution (1%, w/v): 2 bottles of sucrose solution were placed in each cage for 24 hours, and then 1 bottle
of sucrose solution was replaced with water for 24 hours. After the adaptation, the mice were deprived of water and food
for 24 hours. The test was conducted at 9:30 am, and during
the test the mice were housed in individual cages and had
free access to 2 bottles containing sucrose solution and water,
respectively. After 24 hours, we recorded the volumes of the
sucrose solution and water that had been consumed.

Novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT)
The NSFT was conducted 24 hours after the last SPT. The
NSFT was performed during an 8-minute period, as previously described.26,27 Briefly, the testing apparatus consisted of
a plastic box (50 × 50 × 20 cm). Food was withheld from the
mice for 24 hours before the test. At the beginning of the test,
a single pellet of food was placed on a white paper platform
positioned at the centre of the box. We placed a mouse in a
corner of the maze and immediately started a stopwatch. The
scoring to measure interest began when the mouse reached
for the food with its forepaws and began eating. As a control
value, we measured the home-cage food consumption within
the 15 minutes immediately following the test.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
To detect the relative protein or miR-132 expression, 5 animals per group were anesthetized and sacrificed 24 hours after the NSFT. The whole hippocampus was carefully dissected from each hemisphere, frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at –80°C. We used 1 hemisphere for the PCR experiment and the other for a Western blot experiment. Four samples were randomly selected from 5 hippocampus tissues
and used for each ­experiment.
We extrated total RNA using the miRNeasy kit (QIAGEN).
We used Bulge-Loop miRNA primers for the mouse miR-132
(RiboBio), and real-time PCR reactions were performed using
a SYBR Premix Ex Taq Kit in the Applied Biosystems 7500
system. We analyzed the results using the 2−ΔΔCT method.
The expression of the U6 small nucleolar RNA gene was used
as an internal control.

miR-132 antagomir experiments
To study the potential function of miR-132 in mouse hippocampal neuronal proliferation, we adopted a miRNA antagomir strategy. We antagonized the expression of miR-132
in the hippocampus using an antagomir that specifically targets miR-132. Mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: the
control-vehicle group, the CUMS-vehicle group, the CUMS-

350

oleanolic acid+antagomir-control group and the CUMS-­
oleanolic acid+miR-132 antagomir group. A miR-132 antagomir or an antagomir-control was dissolved in artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (0.5 nmol for each mouse) and infused by
micro-syringe into the lateral ventricle.28,29 The repeated antagomir treatment was performed once per week during the
last 3 weeks of the experiment.

Western blot
Hippocampus samples were homogenized in a lysis buffer
and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The homogenates were
centrifuged at 14 000g for 20 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatants were collected. The protein concentration was determined by a bicinchoninic acid assay. The proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane. After blocking in 3% bovine serum albumin/trisbuffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature
for 1 hour, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies at 4°C overnight (anti-BDNF 1:500,
anti-synapsin I 1:1000, anti-PSD95 1:1000, anti-ERK 1:1000,
anti-pERK 1:2000, anti-CREB 1:1000, anti-pCREB 1:1000, antiGAPDH 1:5000). After washing with TBST 3 times, the membranes were incubated with an horseradish peroxidase–
labelled secondary antibody (1:2000). The blots were washed
again 3 times with TBST buffer, and the immunoreactive
bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence
method. The results were normalized to the protein expression level of GAPDH in each sample.

Brain extraction and immunohistochemistry
For the test of the hippocampal neuronal proliferation, 3 mice
were injected with BrdU (50 mg/kg, twice daily for 2 successive days). Twenty-four hours after the last BrdU injection, the
mice were immediately anesthetized with chloral hydrate
(0.35 g/kg) and then sacrificed by intracardial perfusion with
heparinized 0.9% saline followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed and postfixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde overnight and incubated with 30% sucrose
solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4°C for 2 days.
To determine the number of BrdU-incorporating cells in
the hippocampus, 6 coronal sections (40 µm) were randomly selected throughout the hippocampus 1.70–2.57 mm
posterior to the bregma, as defined in the mouse brain atlas,
and the sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.30
Free-floating brain sections were incubated for 15 minutes
in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide at room temperature to eliminate endogenous peroxidase. To detect BrdU-incorporated
cells, the free-floating sections were rinsed extensively with
PBS (0.05 M), and the sections were incubated for 30 minutes in hydrogen chloride at 37 °C to denature the DNA.
The sections were neutralized by incubating them for
10 minutes in borate buffer. Then we used the anti-BrdU
­antibody as a primary antibody (1:5000) overnight at room
temperature. Subsequently, the sections were intermittently
rinsed with PBS and incubated with a biotinylated anti-rat

Oleanolic acid restores the behavioural dysfunctions
­induced by CUMS

Fig. 1: Oleanolic acid produces antidepressant-like effect in the
chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model. The behavioural
tests were conducted 1 hour after the last injection. (A) Oleanolic
acid increased the sucrose preference in the CUMS groups (F6,49 =
5.698, p < 0.001). (B) Oleanolic acid decreased the latency period
until feeding in the novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT; F6,49 =
7.322, p < 0.001). (C) Oleanolic acid had no effect on the home-cage
feed consumption within 15 minutes following the NSFT (F6,49 = 0.44,
p = 0.85) Oleanolic acid did not affect sucrose preference (F6,49 =
0.26, p = 0.95), latency period until feeding (F6,49 = 0.24, p = 0.96) or
home-cage feed consumption (F6,49 = 0.35, p = 0.91) in control animals. The data represent the means ± standard errors of the mean

After a 4-week CUMS procedure, the sucrose preference in
the CUMS groups was significantly lower than that in the
control groups for the first SPT (77.03 ± 2.44 in the control
groups v. 52.71 ± 2.40 in the CUMS groups, F1,110 = 50.214,
p < 0.001). Treatment with oleanolic acid for 3 weeks at concentrations of 5–40 mg/kg significantly increased the sucrose
preference in the SPT and decreased the latency period until
feeding in the NSFT; the change at a concentration of 2.5 mg/
kg was not significant (Fig. 1A and B). The largest effect was
obtained at a concentration of 20 mg/kg, when the sucrose
preference increased by 72.8% (81.76 v. 47.32) and the latency
period until feeding decreased by 40.4% (223.25 v. 386.87)
rela­tive to the CUMS-vehicle group. On the other hand, there
was no difference in the home-cage feed consumption within
15 minutes (Fig. 1C) conducted immediately after the NSFT,
indicating that the effects of oleanolic acid were not due to a
general increase in feeding.
Further behavioural experiments revealed that treatment
with oleanolic acid for 3 weeks had no significant effects on
sucrose preference (Fig. 1A) and latency period until feeding
(Fig. 1B) in naive mice, indicating that the effect of oleanolic
acid was limited to stressed animals.

BDNF-related miR-132 upregulation mediates
­antidepressant-like effects of oleanolic acid
To further determine whether BDNF-TrkB signalling is necessary for the antidepressant-like effects of oleanolic acid, mice in
the CUMS groups were cotreated for 3 weeks with oleanolic
acid (20 mg/kg) and K252a, a selective inhibitor of the tyrosine
protein kinase activity of the trk family of neurotrophin receptors. The behavioural changes were examined 24–48 hours after
the last injection. As shown in Figure 3, the K252a injections
abolished the antidepressant-like effects of oleanolic acid.
Because miR-132 is regulated by BDNF, we next examined
whether K252a injection blocked the neurogenic effect of oleanolic acid. To this end, we either administered BrdU injections
or sacrificed the mice immediately after the NSFT. We found
that K252a pretreatment dramatically prevented the oleanolic
acid–induced elevation of miR-132 expression. Moreover, as
miR-132 has a positive effect on the increase in neuronal outgrowth and synaptic protein levels, we measured the presynaptic protein synapsin I, postsynaptic protein PSD95 and neur­
onal cell proliferation. Oleanolic acid significantly increased
synapsin I, PSD95 and neuronal cell proliferation. Interestingly, these increases were weakened by K252a injection. Together, these results suggest that BDNF signalling is necessary
for the regulation of miR-132 by oleanolic acid.
In addition, since the ERK pathway is a key downstream
signalling pathway of BDNF and upstream signalling pathway of miR-132, we also examined the BDNF–TrkB–ERK
downstream signalling pathway induced by oleanolic acid in
combination with K252a. There was a significant difference
in pERK between the control and CUMS groups. Oleanolic
acid counteracted the pERK deficiency induced by CUMS.
More importantly, this regulation of oleanolic acid was fully
blocked by K252a injections.

ERK signalling mediates miR-132 regulation
of oleanolic acid
To further investigate the possibility that the ERK pathway is
involved in the oleanolic acid–potentiated miR-132 and neur­
onal proliferation, we examined the effects of U0126 in our system. In the presence of U0126 (0.4 mg/kg/day), the oleanolic
acid–induced behavioural improvement was completely
blocked (Fig. 4). In addition, we examined the effects of U0126
on the oleanolic acid–induced neurogenic improvement. We

To further investigate the possible mechanisms that underlie
the oleanolic acid–induced neurogenic effects, we measured
the expression of BDNF, which is important for synaptic
protein and neuronal proliferation in the brain. Our results
showed that oleanolic acid markedly reversed the BDNF
downregulation induced by CUMS (Fig. 2).
In parallel, miR-132 expression, which was significantly inhibited by CUMS, was increased by treatment with both oleanolic acid and fluoxetine.

found that miR-132, presynaptic protein synapsin I, PSD95
and neuronal cell proliferation were abolished by pretreatment
with the inhibitor.

miR-132 regulated by oleanolic acid

Next, because miR-132 is regulated by CREB, we also
evaluated the CREB levels after oleanolic acid treatment or
cotreatment with U0126. We found reduced CREB phosphorylation in the CUMS groups compared with the control
groups. Chronic oleanolic acid administration totally counteracted this stress-induced abnormality. This role of oleanolic acid was fully blocked by U0126 coinjections. These
results suggest that ERK-CREB is required for the oleanolic
acid–potentiated miR-132.

miR-132 expression is necessary for neuronal cell
­proliferation by oleanolic acid
To verify the possible involvement of miR-132 in the regulation of synaptic protein expression and neuronal cell proliferation, we examined the effect of an antagomir to inhibit the
miR-132 function. Treatment with an miR-132 antagomir significantly reduced the expression of miR-132 in the hippocampus induced by oleanolic acid compared with the miR-132 antagomir control and the oleanolic acid cotreated groups
(Fig. 5). Similarly, the miR-132 antagomir also abolished the effect of oleanolic acid on behaviours, neuronal cell proliferation
and postsynaptic protein PSD95. However, as shown in
Fig. 5E, in contrast to postsynaptic protein PSD95, no change
in the levels of the presynaptic protein synapsin I was caused
by the miR-132 antagomir with or without oleanolic acid.

Discussion
The present study provides in vivo evidence that silencing
miR-132 in mice using antagomirs prevents behavioural improvement and neurotrophic signalling induced by oleanolic acid and shows that oleanolic acid administration prevents chronic stress-impaired neuronal proliferation
through TrkB receptor–mediated modulation of hippocampus BDNF–ERK–CREB–miR-132 signalling. To our know­
ledge, this study is the first to analyze miR-132 expression
in a ­depression-like model of CUMS.
Oleanolic acid is a natural pentacyclic triterpene that is
widely distributed in food and medicinal plants. It can be
found in Prunus mume, Vitis vinifera, Sambucus chinesis,
Panax ginseng, Oldenlandia diffusa and Rabdosia rubescens.31–33
We recently reported that oleanolic acid increased BDNF
levels and produced antidepressant behavioural effects in
stressed animals.19 In the present study, we used another efficacious CUMS procedure to mimic stress in daily life in
animals. A decreased sucrose preference and a prolonged
latency to feed induced by the CUMS procedure were significantly restored by a 3-week regimen of oleanolic acid
administration, which confirmed the antidepressant-like effect of oleanolic acid. In addition to behavioural deficits,
one widespread feature of major depression is the inhibition
of neurotrophic system regulation.3 Consistent with the results of our previous study, the present results also indicated that oleanolic acid ameliorated the deficits in hippocampal BDNF expression induced by CUMS.19
Within the central nervous system, microRNAs have
emerged as important effectors of an array of developmental,

physiologic, and cognitive processes.34 We focused on the enhancement of BDNF-induced miR-132 by treatment with oleanolic acid because miR-132 can promote neural growth,35
synaptic function16,36 and cognitive deficits,37 which were associated with antidepressant action. In addition, miR-132 was
significantly upregulated in nonlearned, helpless rats compared with learned helpless ones.38 We therefore detected
this microRNA expression in a depression-like model of
CUMS. The data provided from PCR indicated that CUMS
suppressed the levels of miR-132 in the hippocampus. Previous studies have shown that BDNF upregulated the levels of
miR-132 in cortical cultures and dopamine neurons,39,40 that
miR-132 overexpression enhanced neurite outgrowth in PC12
cells35 and that miR-132 knockdown impaired the integration
of newborn neurons into the excitatory synaptic circuitry of
the adult brain.41 Moreover, decreased expression of miR-132
after glucocorticoid treatment in vitro has also been reported.16 Chronic constriction injury steadily decreased the
relative expression of miR-132 in the rat hippocampus.42
Thus, findings on this particular miRNA using CUMS may
be extrapolated to other depression models. On the other
hand, the finding that miR-132 was restored by fluoxetine
and oleanolic acid suggests that miR-132 may serve as a hippocampal target of antidepressant treatments. In addition,
the finding of decreased PSD95 expression and neuronal cell
proliferation resulting from CUMS is consistent with the
findings of a previous study demonstrating that chronic
stress causes dendritic atrophy of neurons in the brain.43 Oleanolic acid administration for 3 weeks significantly attenuated these deficits.
The present work also showed that the CUMS-induced
reductions of sucrose preference and BDNF expression
were attenuated by chronic fluoxetine treatment, which is
consistent with reults of a previous study.7 At the same
time, fluoxetine also upregulated miR-132 expression in
hippocampus. Previous researches have demonstrated that
fluoxetine possessed the ability to increase miR-598 and
miR-451 expression in the rat hippocampus44 and down­
regu­late miR-16 levels in the mouse hippocampus. 45 Our
finding supplies additional evidence to demonstrate the involvement of hippocampal miR-132 in fluoxetine treatment.
In addition, it should be noted that treatment with oleanolic
acid and fluoxetine elevated miR-132 above control levels.
In fact, the increase of miR-132 outweighed that of BDNF
during neuronal differentiation.40 In addition, the expression of miR-132 increased up to 4-fold the sensitivity induced by BDNF.39 Some potent antidepressant agents, such
as luteolin increased miR-132 levels 2-fold above control
levels. We speculate that this elevation may be attributed to
the additional elevation of BDNF levels by oleanolic acid
and fluoxetine treatments.
In an attempt to move beyond receptor/ligand-based
­theories of pathology, signalling transduction pathways
have become a new focus in depression research.46 The
BDNF–TrkB–ERK downstream signalling pathway has been
proposed as an intracellular signalling mechanism mediating antidepressant efficacy and miR-132 regulation.14 Therefore, mice were coinjected with oleanolic acid (20 mg/kg)

miR-132 regulated by oleanolic acid

and K252a (25 µg/kg), a potent pharmacological inhibitor of
the BDNF receptor TrkB, for 3 weeks. The results indicated
that K252a abolished the antidepressant-like effects of oleanolic acid in the SPT and NSFT and inhibited hippocampal
miR-132, synapsin I, PSD95 and neuronal cell proliferation.
Combined with previous findings that upregulation of miR132 was caused by BNDF,16 these results confirmed that oleanolic acid, through BDNF–miR-132, positively regulated synaptic protein levels and neural growth.
As the activation of p-ERK induced by oleanolic acid was
suppressed by K252a, to further investigate the possibility
that the ERK pathway is involved in the oleanolic acid–
potentiated miR-132 and neuronal proliferation, we examined the effects of U0126, an ERK inhibitor, in our system. In
addition to miR-132, we also examined the changes in CREB
activity, because CREB is a downstream regulator of the ERK
cascade and CREB phosphorylation has also been proposed
as an intracellular signalling mechanism that mediates
neur­on proliferation and cognitive deficits.20 On the other
hand, CREB could regulate the transcription of miR-132.12
The effect of oleanolic acid on CREB phosphorylation was
abolished using the ERK inhibitor U0126, and it inhibited
miR-132, PSD95 expression and neuronal cell proliferation,
suggesting that the hippocampal ERK–CREB signalling pathway is necessary for upregulation of miR-132 and the
­antidepressant-like effect of oleanolic acid. Consistent with
our study, a recent study also demonstrated that the transcription of miR-132 is strongly regulated by the ERK signalling pathway in neurons.14 Therefore, the BDNF–ERK–CREB
signalling pathway is involved in the antidepressant-like effect of oleanolic acid and regulation of miR-132.
We next used antagomirs to reduce hippocampal miR-132
levels, thereby modelling the oleanolic acid-induced miR-132
profile. Antagomirs are known to function by complementary binding, leading to non–RNAi-mediated degradation of
the miRNA.47 Because a previous study confirmed that antagomirs efficiently silence target miRNAs in the central nervous system when they are only injected locally into the
mouse brain,48 the miR-132 antagomir was infused into the
lateral ventricle in the present study. The results demonstrated that miR-132 antagomir profoundly abolished oleanolic acid–induced neuronal cell proliferation. Very recently,
Luikart and colleagues41 reported that knockdown of miR132 impaired the integration of newborn neurons, a biomarker that can be enhanced by antidepressants.49 Together,
our findings suggest that miR-132 plays an important role in
the effects of oleanolic acid on neuronal growth in vivo.
Interestingly, we found that antagomirs targeting miR-132
attenuated only oleanolic acid–induced postsynaptic protein
PSD95. On the contrary, presynaptic protein synapsin I was
not influenced by the miR-132 antagomir. Previous studies
also suggest a model in which enhanced levels of BDNF lead
to changes in the neuronal transcriptome directly via the repression of target gene expression and indirectly via the
regu­lation of neuronal miRNA expression.50,51 In addition,
­Kawashima and colleagues16 found that the transfection of
antisense RNA to inhibit miR-132 function decreased the
BDNF-dependent increase in the expression of postsynaptic

proteins, but did not affect the expression of presynaptic proteins. Moreover, considering that ERK is able to regulate
transcription both by the direct phosphorylation of specific
transcription factors and by the indirect activation of downstream kinases or miRNAs,14 it is possible that oleanolic acid
regulates postsynaptic protein via miR-132-dependent mechanisms and regulates presynaptic protein via miR-132-­
independent mechanisms.

Limitations
It should be noted that our study did not have a vehicle control group with K252a or U0126, thus an antagonist or inhibitor effect may have contributed to our results. This is one of
the limitations of the present study. In our previous study,
25 µg/kg of K252a did not alter animal behaviours.22 In addition, in our preliminary study, neither sucrose preference nor
latency period until feeding was affected by U0126 in mice
exposed to CUMS. Moreover, previous studies also found
that treatment with U0126 alone did not induce any alteration in miR-132 expression.35,39 A control experiment in a
­future study will be helpful to show that an antagonist or inhibitor at the dose tested does not induced related actions.
It is generally accepted that several other stimuli can also
induce CREB phosphorylation in the hippocampus. Thus,
regulation of miR-132 may not be restricted to neurotrophic
signalling. Another signalling pathway, such as protein kin­
ase A, could have contributed to miR-132 regulation. In addition, it is not entirely clear how miR-132 levels could be
used as a hippocampal target of antidepressant treatments,
as other depression-like models and clinical antidepressants
were not evaluated in the present study.

Conclusion
Our results provide direct evidence that oleanolic acid exerts
antidepressant-like properties in an animal model of depression, and these effects appear to be partly mediated through
upregulation of the hippocampal BDNF–TrkB–ERK–CREB–
miR-132 signalling pathway. In addition, we have demonstrated that miR-132 is inhibited in CUMS-induced depression, and it is critical for the antidepressant-like effect of
oleanolic acid. Our study provides a future direction for the
examination of mechanisms of depression related to miR-132
as well as further insight into the possible therapeutic use of
oleanolic acid for treating major depression.
