Tolerability among Ten Drugs for
Treatment of Parkinson’s Disease:
A Network Meta-Analysis

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a long term disorder affects the central nervous system and we aim to
determine the relative efficacy of the current available drugs used in PD. Firstly, we performed a
systematic review in current literature and eligible studies were retrieved from online databases,
relevant data were extracted. Efficacy of these medications was assessed by different Unified
Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scales (UPDRS). Mean difference (MD) and odds ratio (OR) were produced
by pairwise or network meta-analysis (NMA). Finally, we performed a cluster analysis for the included
medications with respect to their surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). Pairwise metaanalysis suggests that selegiline had a higher ranking in UPDRS II, UPDRS III and UPDRS total than
bromocriptine and levodopa. Selegiline was more tolerable than bromocriptine (OR = 0.62, CI: 0.39 to
0.98) and pramipexole was less tolerable than levodopa (OR = 1.43, CI = 1.00 to 2.04). Results of NMA
indicate that patients with levodopa, pramipexole, ropinirole and selegiline exhibited a significantly
improved UPDRS III than those with lazabemide. To sum up, levodopa, selegiline, ropinirole and
rotigotine were recommended for PD patients as they appeared relatively high efficacy and tolerability.
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder accompanied with several cardinal motor characteristic symptoms including resting tremor, postural instability, rigidity and bradykinesia. Previous studies have
proved that PD was a result of the depletion of dopaminergic neurons in substantianigra1. In addition, age per se
is a key factor that affects PD’s pathogenesis and progression by changing cellular processes and functions that
related with neurodegeneration2.
PD is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases ranking only second to Alzheimer’s disease3.
According to a rough estimation performed by Twelves et al., incidence of PD around the world was around
16–19 per 100,000 people per year, with highest incidence in males aging between 70 and 79 years4. Since population worldwide is aging gradually, it is predicted by Dorsey et al. that the population of patients affected by
PD will double in 20305. Apart from the high prevalence rate among elder males, PD is also characterized with a
high mortality. In a 20 years follow-up of 136 patients diagnosed with new-onset PD, a high mortality of 74% was
observed and dementia occurred in 83% of the remaining survivors6.
So far, all treatments for PD were aimed at alleviating its clinical symptoms and improving the life quality
of patients and no curative therapy has been developed to reverse the underlying neurodegenerative process7.
Levodopa, dopamine agonists (DA) and monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors (MAOBI) are mainstream drugs
that are widely used as first-line treatments of PD. Among them, levodopa performed best in symptomatic control

nodes represents the number of people involved and the number between two nodes represents the number of
study involved in the head-to-head comparison.

represents a group of treatments that belong to the same cluster. Treatments lying in the upper right corner are
more effective and safe than the other treatments.

and it guaranteed at least 50% improvement in symptomatic for a period of 2 to 3 years8. However, levodopa
would cause increased dyskinesia, motor fluctuations and other adverse effects in the long term9,10. To prolong
the beneficial effect of motor symptomatic control, levodopa is often combined with DA or MAOBI as adjunctive
therapy for all-stage PD patients. DA, such as bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole and
rotigotine, is a class of drugs that act on D2 receptors and work well in controlling motor fluctuations7. Apart
from acting as an adjunct therapy to levodopa, it’s also widely used as monotherapy for PD in early stages to

delay the utilization of levodopa therapy11. Monoamine oxidase type B (MAOB) is the leading enzyme regulating
concentrations of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine that are related with emotion, movement and cognition in human brain12. In clinical trials, its inhibitor has been used to down-regulate the degree of
on-off motor fluctuations13. Rasagiline and selegiline are both selective and irreversible MAOBI and now used as
anti-Parkinson drug or adjunct to levodopa, wherein former one is more potent in vivo13,14. Besides, lazabemide
is also a drug of MAOBI. Similarly, their adverse motor effects such as dizziness, wearing-off, on-off phenomena
and insomnia also raised concerns.
Tough numerous placebo-controlled trails have been implemented to assess efficacy of anti-Parkinson drugs,
no comprehensive comparisons for efficacy and tolerability among all available treatments were conducted. As
such, present study was designed to make comparisons of monotherapy’s efficacy and tolerability among ten
drugs mentioned above by combining evidence from previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Results

Study characteristics. As presented in Figure S1, 110 publications involving 24,864 participants were finally

included in the present study after screening 1,154 publications according to the inclusion criteria13,15–123. Baseline

characteristics were shown in Table 1. As we can see, all these studies were designed as RCTs and most of them
were double-blind RCTs. Patients were diagnosed as either early or advanced PD and most of them were male
above 60. Besides, we draw a network of included trials in Fig. 1, from which we observed that most RCTs had
taken placebo as the control group. Among all interventions, Pramipexole, Ropinirole, Levodopa and Rasagiline
were involved in most studies and had relative bigger sample sizes.

Meta-analysis results for pair-wise comparisons. Meta-analysis results for pair-wise comparisons were
shown in Table 2. We found that lazabemide exhibited a worse efficacy with respect to UPDRS II compared with

Scale.

placebo (MD =​ 0.82, CI: 0.29 to 1.34). Patients with levodopa, pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine and selegiline
all functioned better with respect to UPDRS II and III than those with placebo. With respect to UPDRS total,
lazabemide also functioned worse than placebo (MD =​ 1.88, CI: 0.57 to 3.19) while bromocriptine, levodopa,
rasagiline and selegiline functioned better. Besides, selegiline had a higher score in UPDRS II, UPDRS III and
UPDRS total than bromocriptine and levodopa. As for withdrawal, only rotigotine had a significant lower withdrawal rate than placebo. Besides, selegiline was more tolerable than bromocriptine (OR =​ 0.62, CI: 0.39 to 0.98)
and pramipexole had a higher withdraw rate than levodopa (OR =​  1.43, CI =​ 1.00 to 2.04).

Network meta-analysis results. As we can see in Table 3 and Figures S2–5, for UPDRS II, levodopa,
pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine and selegiline exhibited increased efficacy compared to placebo and lazabemide All interventions except for cabergoline, lazabemide, pergolide and rasagiline exhibited an increased efficacy
compared to the placebo with respect to UPDRS III. Patients with levodopa, pramipexole, ropinirole and selegiline exhibited a significantly improved UPDRS III than those with lazabemide. Our NMA suggests that only
patients with selegiline exhibited significantly improved UPDRS total than those with placebo (MD =​  −6​ .04, CrI:
−​11.07 to −​0.83). On the other hand, patients with levodopa or ropinirole exhibited a lower risk of withdrawals
compared to those with placebo and bromocriptine (ORs <​ 1). Finally, selegiline appeared to have higher withdraw rate than levodopa, ropinirole and rotigotine with respect to the likelihood of withdrawals (OR =​  2.43, CrI:
1.42 to 4.23; OR =​ 2.17, CrI: 1.27 to 3.84; OR =​ 1.93, CrI: 1.08 to 3.51).
Cumulative ranking probability as a ranking scheme. Table 4 and Figure S6 showed the cumulative
ranking probability of all interventions based on each outcome. Three drugs including ropinirole, pramipexole,
and selegiline ranked first in UPDRS II, III and total (with the value of 0.773, 0.777 and 0.918 respectively, and
levodopa had the highest rank in withdraw rate. Besides, selegiline ranked the first in UPDRS total but the last in
withdrawal. Levodopa and ropinirole had a high ranking when taking withdrawals into consideration. Besides,
lazabemide was a mild intervention with both low efficacy rank and withdrawal rate. Cluster analysis presented
results above in a more intuitional way (Fig. 2). Interventions with the same level of SUCRA values are displayed
in the same color. Levodopa, ropinirole and rotigotine fall into the group with both the most favorable SUCRA
values and tolerability as well.
Consistency. In node-splitting plot (Figure S7), all P-values are higher than 0.05, which indicated a relatively
satisfactory consistency between direct and indirect evidence. In heat map (Fig. 3), consistency between direct

significant inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence in UPDRS III and UPDRS total.

Discussion

This study made a comprehensive comparison for the tolerability and efficacy among anti-Parkinson drugs by
using a network meta-analysis. Interventions were grouped into placebo, DA (Pramipexole, Ropinirole and
Rotigotine), MAOBI (- Rasagiline and Selegiline) and Levodopa. Efficacy outcomes included unified PD rating
scale (UPDRS) II, UPDRS III and UPDRS total. Taking tolerability, efficacy and adverse effect into consideration,
we also examined withdraw rate, treatments with high withdraw rate means lacking of efficacy, safety or easy to
become tolerant. To our knowledge, this is the first study that well explored the efficacy and tolerability ranking
of these three types of drugs for Parkinson with a great range of outcomes included.
Levodopa is an intervention that is widely used in clinical trials with good control of symptoms of PD.
Noticeably, levodopa is one of the best tolerated treatments for PD, particularly in the elderly patients124. Our
research indicated the same result that levodopa ranked high in UPDRS II and III, and maintained a very low
withdraw rate, which possessed a very favorable balance between efficacy and tolerability and worthy of recommendation. However, it may still cause several long-term adverse events including motor complications and
dyskinesia125.
The efficiency of DA in reducing motor fluctuations and dyskinesias has been reported by previous studies126,127. For instance, Rascol et al. found that patients with early PD can be well controlled with a low risk of
dyskinesia by an initial therapy of ropinirole, an agent of DA, alone. Also, a levodopa-controlled trial conducted
by FulvioBracco et al. suggested that patients with PD were in a lower risk of motor fluctuations when treated
with cabergoline, another agent of DA, though the relative safety was at the expense of a mildly improved clinical
symptom24. Thus, these drugs were usually added into levodopa to weaken its adverse effects in clinical trials.
Compared to levodopa, MAOBI was found to decrease the incidence of disability during the treatment and
motor fluctuations without any notable mortality rate or adverse effects128. Whereas, this meta-analysis conducted
by Ives N.J. et al. was short of direct comparisons between MAOBIs and other types of anti-Parkinson drugs and
thus was not sufficient.
Though our results were consistent with most previous trials, there still exist several flaws. One of the limitations in this study is that we only research on the monotherapy for PD. However, in clinical trials, it’s common
that these drugs were applied together to offset the corresponding adverse effects or the low efficacy rate raised
by monotherapy. Besides, some other influence factors such as dosages, design and sample size may affect the
accuracy and reliability of our results. For this, more clinical trials in comparisons of these interventions are in
desperate need.
In our results, according to SUCRA, four drugs including levodopa, pramipexole, ropinirole and selegiline all
had a well performance in UPDRS II and UPDRS III. And among them, selegiline had a highest UPDRS total and
highest withdraw rate. Levodopa and ropinirole had a higher ranking when withdrawals were taken into consideration. Although lazabemide was a mild intervention with low efficacy rank and withdrawal rate, it has not been
introduced in the market and not available for the patients. Besides, in cluster analysis, levodopa, ropinirole and
rotigotine steadily ranked first in view of three endpoints including UPDRS II, UPDRS III and withdrawal. The
network meta-analysis integrated evidence from 110 independent RCTs and thus provided an accurate results
and smaller random errors.
In conclusion, levodopa, selegiline, ropinirole and rotigotine were recommended for PD patients for their
relatively high efficacy and tolerability. If necessary, an appropriate composition of these drugs will perform well
with a relative low risk of adverse effects and a high efficacy.

Methods and Materials
Search strategy.

Publications in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were retrieved without language
restrictions. Keywords included Parkinson disease, bromocriptine, cabergoline, lazabemide, levodopa, pergolide,
pramipexole, rasagiline, ropinirole, rotigotine, selegiline and RCTs. Publications were first screened by reviewing

www.nature.com/scientificreports/
their titles and abstracts and further reviewed by scanning full texts. In addition, cited references attached to the
included documents were also retrieved.

Inclusion criteria. Studies were included when they met the following criteria:
(1) Experiments were designed as RCTs comparing the efficacy of treatments for PD.
(2) Patients or participants were adults diagnosed with PD.
(3) Outcomes in studies included at least one of the following endpoints: Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating
Scale (UPDRS) II, UPDRS III, UPDRS total and withdrawals.
(4) Interventions included at least one of the following drugs: bromocriptine, cabergoline, lazabemide, levodopa,
pergolide, pramipexole, rasagiline, ropinirole, rotigotine and selegiline.

Data extraction.

After reading through the full text, the following information was extracted from each
independent study: author, publication year, sample size, gender ratio, design, blind, follow-up, age, condition
of PD, intervention and dosage. As for outcomes, several unified PD rating scales (UPDRS) including UPDRS
II, UPDRS III and UPDRS total were extracted if available, which has been considered as the primary efficacy
outcomes in this analysis; meanwhile the rate of withdraw during the treatment was adopted as an endpoint integrating tolerability, efficacy and adverse effect as a whole.

Statistical analysis. STATA version 12.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) software was applied in
traditional meta-analysis. Firstly, the heterogeneity was examined by using Cochran’s Q-statistic or I2 test. When
significant heterogeneity did not exist (P >​  0.05 or I2 <50%), a fixed-effects model (Mantel-Haenszel method)
was performed. Otherwise, we tried to find out the source of heterogeneity and eliminate the potential source of
heterogeneity. Alternatively, a random-effects model (Der Simonian-Laird method) would be applied. For count
data such as withdrawal, odd ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. For
measurement data including UPDRS II, UPDRS III, UPDRS total, withdrawals, the mean difference (MD) and
the corresponding 95% CI were calculated.
WinBUGS (MRC Bio-statistics Unit, Cambridge, UK) software was applied in network meta-analysis (NMA).
To combine both direct and indirect evidence, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method and Bayesian networks were
built. Similar with cases in traditional meta-analysis, OR and MD were separately used in count data and measurement data. Meanwhile, the corresponding 95% credential interval (CrI) was also calculated. To illustrate the
results from NMA more directly, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was drawn and presented the ranking according to different endpoints. SUCRA enable us to identify the best treatment overall.
The value of SUCRA would be 1 (i.e. 100%) for the best and 0 for the worst. In addition, a cluster analysis was
conducted to combine the ranking under two independent endpoints and divide the interventions into several
levels in view of their performan
Consistency between direct and indirect evidence was assessed by P-value and P >​ 0.05 exhibited a significant
consistency. A heat map was plotted to present the consistency between direct evidence and NMA results, in
which red indicates significant inconsistency while blue indicates significant consistency.
