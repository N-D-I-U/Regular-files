Neurotrophins are growth factors that are important in neuronal
development and survival as well as synapse formation and
plasticity. Many of the effects of neurotrophins are mediated by
changes in protein expression as a result of altered transcription
or translation. To determine whether neurotrophins regulate
the production of microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNA species
that modulate protein translation or mRNA stability, we used
deep sequencing to identify BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic
factor)-induced miRNAs in cultured primary cortical mouse
neurons. This revealed that the miR-212/132 cluster contained
the miRNAs most responsive to BDNF treatment. This cluster
was found to produce four miRNAs: miR-132, miR-132*, miR-

212 and miR-212*. Using specific inhibitors, mouse models and
promoter analysis we have shown that the regulation of the
transcription of the miR-212/132 miRNA cluster and the miRNAs
derived from it are regulated by the ERK1/2 (extracellular-signalregulated kinase 1/2) pathway, via both MSK (mitogen and stressactivated kinase)-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION

mediating the downstream effect of neurotrophins. To date, most
studies have focused on the neurotrophin-induced expression of
protein-encoding genes; however, the gene encoding the miRNA
(microRNA) miR-132 has been shown to be transcriptionally
induced by neurotrophins [6].
miRNAs are small (21–24 nt) regulatory RNAs that regulate
gene expression post-transcriptionally by altering the translation
of their target mRNAs. In the genome, miRNAs can be located in
either the introns of protein-coding and non-coding genes, exons
of non-coding genes or in intragenic regions [7]. The first step
in miRNA production is the transcription and processing of a primiRNA (primary miRNA). The majority of pri-miRNAs are first
processed by the Microprocessor complex in the nucleus releasing
a hairpin-structured pre-miRNA [8–10]. The pre-miRNAs are
then exported into the cytoplasm where they are processed further
by Dicer into a small double-stranded intermediate [10–12]. One
strand of a miRNA is loaded into RISC (RNA-induced silencing
complex) of which a key component is an Argonaute protein
[13–16]. Activated miRNA complexes can either cleave their
target mRNA or regulate its translation, through a variety of
mechanisms [17]. In vivo, miRNAs have been shown to modulate
several processes, including development, immunity and neuronal
function. In addition miRNAs may have pathological roles, for
instance in cancer and tumorigenesis [18].
It is possible that neurotrophins may induce other miRNAs in
addition to miR-132 and that this could represent a mechanism

Neurotrophins comprise a family of growth factors that are
important for both neuronal development and survival as well as
synapse formation and plasticity. Four neurotrophins have been
identified in mammalian cells: NGF (nerve growth factor), BDNF
(brain-derived neurotrophic factor), NT3 (neurotrophin 3) and
NT4 (neurotrophin 4) (reviewed in [1–5]). NGF functions by
activating the TrkA receptor, whereas BDNF and NT4 act via
TrkB. NT3 binds most strongly to TrkC; however, under some
circumstances, it may also be able to act via TrkA and TrkB. In
addition, all four neurotrophins may be able to stimulate cells
via p75NTR (p75 neurotrophin receptor), a member of the TNF
(tumour necrosis factor) receptor superfamily.
Binding of neurotrophins to Trk receptors results in the
activation of the tyrosine kinase domain in the receptor. This
leads to activation of several intracellular signalling pathways,
including the ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2),
PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and PLC (phospholipase C)
pathways [1–5]. These signalling cascades promote the effects of
neurotrophins via multiple mechanisms; however, an important
aspect of their function is to regulate specific changes in
gene transcription. These transcriptional changes are critical for
many of the effects of neurotrophins. Although neurotrophic
stimulation can affect the expression of hundreds of genes, less
is understood about the roles of many of the individual genes in

of fine-tuning the protein expression following neurotrophic
stimulation. We therefore looked to see what effect BDNF stimulation had on the overall expression of miRNAs in cultured
cortical neurons. We have found that only the miR-212/132 cluster
reproducibly produces miRNAs upon BDNF induction. Analysis
of the signalling cascades required for the induction of the miR212/132 cluster revealed a critical role for the ERK1/2 pathway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Oligonucleotides

The following RNA oligonucleotides (Dharmacon) were used
in the present study: mmu-miR-132, UAACAGUCUACAGCCAUGGUCG; mmu-miR-132 complementary sequence (used
as a probe for Northern hybridization), CGACCAUGGCUGUAGACUGUUA; mmu-miR-212, UAACAGUCUCCAGUCACGGCC; and mmu-miR-212 complementary sequence (used
as a probe for Northern hybridization), GGCCGUGACUGGAGACUGUUA.
Mice and cell culture

MSK (mitogen- and stress-activated kinase) 1- and MSK2knockout and nestin-Cre transgenic mice have been described
previously [19–21]. Conditional knockin of CREB (cAMPresponse-element-binding protein) has been described previously
[22], and, to generate the neuronal-specific knockin, CREB
S133A mice were crossed on to a nestin-Cre background. All
mice lines used had been back-crossed on to C57Bl/6 for at least
six generations. All experiments involving mice were subject to
local ethical review and were carried out in accordance with U.K.
Home Office regulations.
Cortical cultures were isolated as described previously [23],
and were cultured in Neurobasal A medium supplemented with
2 % (v/v) B27, 1 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and
0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and plated on to poly-D-lysine-coated
plates (100 μg/ml). HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM
(Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium) supplemented with 10 %
(v/v) FBS (fetal bovine serum), 5 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml
penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. HeLa cells were serumstarved for 16 h before stimulation.
Where indicated, cells were incubated with PD184352 (2 μM),
SB203580 (5 μM), Kn93 (30 μM), PI103 (10 μM) Bi-D1870
(5 μM) or MK 801 (10 μM) for 1 h before stimulation. Cells
were stimulated with BNDF (50 ng/ml), PMA (400 ng/ml) or
anisomycin (10 mg/ml). For RNA isolation, cells were lysed and
RNA was isolated using microRNeasy mini kits (Qiagen) in line
with the manufacturer’s protocol. For immunoblotting, neurons
were lysed directly into SDS sample buffer, whereas HeLa
cells were lysed into 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EGTA,
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM sodium
fluoride, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27 M sucrose, 1 % (v/v)
Triton X-100 and 0.1 % 2-mercaptoethanol and centrifuged at
13 000 g for 5 min at 4 ◦C to remove insoluble material.
Sequencing and analysis

Purified total RNA from unstimulated primary cortical neurons
or neurons stimulated with 50 ng/ml BDNF was separated
on polyacrylamide gels and the band corresponding to small
RNAs was excised. cDNA libraries were generated containing
small RNA sequences by ligation of adapters attached to both
ends, and sequencing was carried out using Solexa technology.
A total of 2 217 376 and 3 696 184 raw sequence reads were


obtained for the unstimulated and BDNF-stimulated samples.
The native RNA sequences were retrieved by removing the 3
‘TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG’ adaptor tag. Removal of the
adaptor tag was performed with a perl script allowing for inexact
matching. Searching from the 5 end of each read, a minimum
length match of four bases was required which was then extended
to the end of the reads allowing for up to three correctly matched
tag bases for every one mismatched. Any reads containing A13
poly-A bases or unknown bases were removed.
Quality filtering was then performed similar to that previously
described [24], where, starting from the 5 end of each read,
a minimum quality score of 20 was required over a sliding
window of four bases. Sequence reads were clipped at the first
position where the mean quality fell below 20. The qualityfiltered reads were then collated to their unique examples, but
only including those longer than 16 bases in length and with an
abundance count of >1. This filtering resulted in 62 613 unique
sequences totaling 2 213 730 reads for the control dataset, and
127 734 unique sequences totaling 3 692 981 reads for the BDNFstimulated dataset.
Sequence matching the collated reads was performed with the
Vmatch algorithm [25] against annotated ncRNAs (non-coding
RNAs) (Ensembl release 52) [26] and annotated miRNA hairpin
sequences (miRBase release 12) [27]. The full complement of
tRNA sequences were added to the downloadable ncRNA dataset
from Ensembl via a perl script accessing the Ensembl API. All
Vmatch runs were performed allowing for up to two mismatches
and only matches with the fewest mismatches were retained for
each read.
The read abundance for the two samples is significantly
different making comparisons problematical. Therefore the
absolute read numbers were normalized relative to the total
abundance of pre-miRNA sequences in each dataset, thus
making comparisons of changes between the samples more
straightforward. Simple counts of sequence reads have an
1
estimated error of n 2 [28] and the control and BDNF errors were
propagated through to the BDNF/Control ratio (see Tables 2 and
3) with the following formula:

αr =

r2

αC 2
α B2
+
C
B

where r, B and C are the values for BDNF/Control ratio, BDNF
and Control data respectively. αr, αB and αC are the errors for
BDNF/Control ratio, BDNF and Control results respectively.

Q-PCR (quantitative PCR)

For PCR of mRNA or intron sequences, total RNA was
reverse-transcribed with iScript (Bio-Rad Laboratories) in line
with the manufacturer’s protocols. Q-PCR was carried out
using SYBR green detection. The PCR programme consisted
of an initial activation step of 3 min at 95 ◦C, followed by
40 cycles of 20 s at 95 ◦C and 45 s at 58 ◦C. Fold induction
was calculated relative to the unstimulated control (wild-type)
sample, using 18S levels to correct for loading [29]. The
primer sequences used are given in Supplementary Table S2 (at
http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/428/bj4280281add.htm).
Q-PCR for mature miRNA was carried out using TaqMan
MicroRNA assays from Applied Biosystems, according to the
manufacturer’s protocols. miR-16 levels were used to correct for
total RNA levels.

Mir-212/132 promoter luciferase reporter constructs

Table 1

A total of 4.553 kb of the mouse miR212/132 promoter was
amplified from a mouse BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome)
clone (RP23-142A14) in two halves using oligonucleotides 5 -gaggatccggaaggttctgtcttcaaatgaggaactc-3 and 5 -catgcggccgcggctcctacac-3 for the 5 portion and oligonucleotides 5 -gccgcggccgcatgaatgagc-3 and 5 -ctaagcttctcgccaccttaggcagcgatac-3
for the 3 portion using KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase
(Novagen). The purified PCR products were cloned into
BglII/HindIII of pGL4.11(luc2P) (Promega) in a three-way
ligation using BamHI/NotI/HindIII. The resulting full-length
clone was fully sequenced.
5 Truncations of the promoter were created by introducing an
XhoI site within the promoter sequence by PCR mutagenesis
using KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen). The
resulting XhoI fragment was then removed by digestion and
gel purification, followed by re-ligation of the vector. A 3
truncated promoter was made by re-amplifying the shorter
promoter sequence from the full-length clone and cloning as a
BamHI/HindIII fragment into BglII/HindIII of pGL4.11(luc2P).
Mutations of the consensus Cre sites were also generated
by PCR mutagenesis and changed the GCAG core region of
the Cre consensus to TAAA. Primer sequences used for mutagenesis are given in Supplementary Table S3 (at http://www.
BiochemJ.org/bj/428/bj4280281add.htm).

RNA species were identified by matching sequence reads to miRBase and Ensembl non-coding
RNA data. Matching was performed with Vmatch allowing for up to two mismatches per read.

reverse transcriptase at 50 ◦C for 1 h. First and nested PCRs were
carried out with KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen).
Amplified DNA sequences were cloned and transformed using
the StratacloneTM Blunt PCR Cloning Kit (Stratagene). A total
of 88 positive clones were sequenced and the sequences were
analysed with Vector NTI software (Invitrogen).

Transfection

Cortical cultures were transfected with promoter-firefly
(0.25 μg/well) and control Renilla (pRL-TK; Promega) luciferase
plasmids (0.1 μg/well) using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen)
transfection reagent. At 2 days after transfection, the cells were
stimulated with BDNF (50 ng/ml) for 3 h, then the cells were lysed
with 1× passive lysis buffer. The luminescence of the samples was
measured using a luminometer (Microlumat plus LB96; Berthold
Technologies).
Immunoblotting

Samples were run on 10 % (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and
transfered on to nitrocellulose membranes using standard
protocols. The antibodies against total ERK1/2 was from
Cell Signaling Technology, and the anti-phospho-CREB
(Ser133 ) monoclonal antobody was from Millipore. Detection
was achieved using HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Pierce) and chemiluminescent substrate
(Amersham Biosciences).
Northern hybridizations

A portion (10 μg) of total RNA was separated on 15 % (w/v)
polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea and 20 mM Mops/NaCl
(pH 7.0). The RNAs were transferred on to a Hybond N
(Amersham Biosciences) nylon membrane by semi-dry blotting.
For the detection of the small RNAs, we followed the published
protocol for sensitive Northern blotting using chemical crosslinking [30] with the only modification being that the filters were
washed for twice for 1 h at 65 ◦C with 0.1 % SDS and 2× SSC
(1× SSC is 0.15 M NaCl/0.015 M sodium citrate). Detection and
quantification of the signals were carried out as described above.
3 RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) analysis

A portion (1 μg) of Qiazol (Qiagen)-extracted total RNA was
subjected to first-strand synthesis with Superscript III (Invitrogen)

RESULTS
miRNA expression in cortical neurons

Primary cortical neuronal cultures were established from C57Bl/6
mice. Total RNA was isolated from both unstimulated cells
and cells that had been stimulated with BDNF for 24 h, and
miRNA expression was analysed by Solexa sequencing. The
output from the sequencing was filtered and collated into unique
examples and then searched against known pre-miRNAs as well
as other known RNAs as detailed in Table 1. This showed that
the vast majority of the isolated RNA matched pre-miRNA
sequences in both samples. In the unstimulated sample, the
matches corresponded to 330 individual pre-miRNA sequences
from the 547 mouse pre-miRNAs annotated in miRBase [27].
Of these, 202 were represented by ten or more hits. For
the BDNF-stimulated sample, there were 373 individual premiRNA matches with 243 having an abundance of at least ten
reads. In both samples, the vast majority of sequences (>90 %)
corresponded to let-7 isoforms. The detailed breakdown of the
pre-miRNA matches can be found in Supplementary Table S1 (at
http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/428/bj4280281add.htm).
Analysis of the normalized expression changes between the
control and BDNF-stimulated results showed that the expression
of most of the miRNAs was similar between the two samples
(Figure 1A and Supplementary Table S1). Twelve pre-miRNAs
had absolute fold changes of >4 and are shown in Table 2.
However, most had fewer than five reads in the control sample,
meaning that the changes were unlikely to be statistically
meaningful. Consistent with this, Q-PCR for miR-712 and miR194-1 showed no up-regulation of these miRNAs following BNDF
treatment (results not shown). Filtering out pre-miRNAs with
fewer than five reads left four pre-miRNAs with a fold change of
>4: miR-98, miR-146a, miR-212 and miR-132 (Table 2).
To confirm the sequencing results, the expression of miR98, miR-146a, miR-212 and miR-132, along with several other
miRNAs that were not expected to change, was examined by
Q-PCR in a second set of samples, independent of those used

for sequencing (Table 3 and Figure 1B). For each of the
selected miRNAs, alignments of the sequencing hits to the
hairpin sequence were examined to determine whether the 5p or
3p sequences were expressed. In most cases, the sequences found
matched the main species annotated in miRBase; however, not
all of the annotated star sequences were observed (Table 3). The
exceptions to this were miR-132 and miR-212, where in addition
to the annotated 3p sequence, the 5p sequence (star sequence) was
also observed. In addition, for miR-132 a sequence corresponding
to the hairpin loop region was also sequenced (Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/428/bj4280281add.htm).
Comparison between the Q-PCR and sequencing results showed
that, although there was reasonable agreement between the two
methods for the non-induced miRNAs (Figure 1A and Table 3),
only two of the four up-regulated miRNAs from the sequencing
results were reproduced in the Q-PCR analysis. Using Q
c The Authors Journal compilation 

PCR, miR-98 and miR-146a were not significantly up-regulated
(P>0.01) after 4 or 24 h of BDNF treatment (Table 1 and
results not shown). The lack of miR-98 up-regulation in the
Q-PCR was unexpected, given the high abundance (up to 74 250
reads) in the sequencing experiment would suggest that this should
be one of the more reproducible results. miR-98 is part of the
let-7 family and, given the very high expression of other let7 isoforms in the neurons, it is possible that either the Q-PCR
was not sufficiently specific for miR-98 relative to the other let-7
isoforms or that the read matching the sequencing results, which
allowed up to two mismatches, could not always differentiate
between miR-98 and other let-7 isoforms. To examine this, the
sequencing results was re-analysed allowing for zero mismatches.
Under this more stringent analysis, the number of miR-98 matches
fell, whereas the fold change between the control and BDNF
sample decreased to 1.22, a value similar to that obtained by

cortical neurons

miRNA profiling following BDNF stimulation.

(A) miRNAs were sequenced from unstimulated and BDNF (50 ng/ml, 24 h)-stimulated cortical
neurons. The sequencing results were analysed as described in the Materials and methods
section, and the numbers of sequences that mapped to each pre-miRNA were plotted. miRNAs
present in only one sample were excluded from the plot. (B) Comparison of Q-PCR and
sequencing results of selected miRNAs (listed in Table 3). Error bars for Q-PCR represents
the S.E.M. for three independent stimulations. Error bars for sequencing results represent
the estimated errors that were calculated as described in the Materials and methods section.
(C) Primary cortical neuronal cultures were left unstimulated or stimulated with 50 ng/ml BDNF
for the indicated times and miR-132 and miR-212 levels were analysed by Northern blotting as
described in the Materials and methods section. Fold induction of the mature miRNAs is given
above the blots. Sizes are indicated in bases to the left of the blots.

Q-PCR. Both miR-132 and miR-212 were still induced using this
analysis method.
Of the miRNAs tested, only miR-132 and miR-212 were upregulated consistently by BDNF in both the sequencing and
Q-PCR results (Figure 1B). Up-regulation of both miR-132
and miR-212 by BNDF could also be demonstrated by Northern
blotting (Figure 1C). Interestingly, both miR-132 and miR-212
map to the same genomic locus, suggesting that their expression
may be co-regulated. miR-132 has been shown previously to be
up-regulated in neuronal cells following neurotrophic stimulation
[6], and has been suggested to be involved in the regulation of
MeCP2 (methyl CpG-binding protein 2) and p250GAP (GTPaseactivating protein) in neurons [31,32]. The regulation of miR-212
expression has not, however, been studied previously in neuronal

In mice, both miR-132 and miR-212 localize to the same
region of chromosome 11. Both miRNAs are also found in an
equivalent localization in other species, including the human and
rat genomes. In rats, miR-132 has been shown to be processed
from the intron of a small non-coding RNA gene [6]. Analysis
of mouse ESTs (expressed sequence tags) revealed evidence for
a similar non-coding gene in mice, consisting of three exons
with miR-132 and miR-212 located in intron 1 (Figure 2A). To
examine the transcription of this gene, PCRs were designed
to amplify regions from intron 1, exon 2, intron 2 and exon 3.
In addition, primers were also made to amplify PCR products
from exons 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3. Using Q-PCR, it was
found that stimulation of primary cortical neurons with BDNF
was able to induce the transcription of this non-coding mRNA
using primer sets that amplified either the exon 1/2 or exon 2/3
fragments (Figure 2B). Cloning of these PCR products confirmed
that the splicing predicted from the ESTs had occurred (results
not shown).
The induction of exons 2 and 3 as well as introns 1 and 2 was also
examined by Q-PCR using the primer sets internal to these regions
(Figure 2). In this case, the absolute amounts of the products were
determined for each PCR using a standard curve prepared from a
plasmid containing a subclone of the miR-212/132 genomic locus.
All four regions were induced by BDNF; however, the absolute
levels of intron 1 were lower than exon 2, consistent with the rapid
processing of this intron by the microprocessor pathway [33].
Unexpectedly, the absolute levels of exon 3 were much lower than
exon 2 (Figure 2C). Analysis of the intron 2 sequence revealed
three potential polyadenylation sites. 3 RACE confirmed that
termination could occur in at least two of these sites in addition
to the polyadenylation site 3 to exon 3 (Supplementary Figure S2 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/428/bj4280281add.htm).
This would suggest that an alternative transcript, with a longer
version of exon 2 but lacking exon 3, was also produced.
Consistent with this, Q-PCR using primers in the 5 region of
intron 2 gave similar results to primers for exon 2 (Figure 2C). This
would suggest that the predominant form expressed following
BDNF stimulation corresponded to termination at the polyadenylation signals in intron 2.
ERK1/2 regulates pri-miR-212/132 transcription

BDNF is known to stimulate a number of intracellular signalling
cascades, leading to the activation of the ERK1/2, CaMK
(Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase) and PI3K pathways.
To determine which of these pathways were involved in miR212/132 transcription, small-molecule inhibitors of these proteins
were used. Profiling of the specificity of these inhibitors has
been reported previously [34]. PI103, a specific PI3K inhibitor,
and Kn93, a CaMK inhibitor, did not affect the transcription
of pri-miR-212/132 in response to BDNF (Figure 3A). In
some experiments, SB203580, a p38α/β MAPK (mitogenactivated protein kinase) inhibitor, resulted in an increase in
pri-miR-212/132 transcription; however, this did not reach
statistical significance (P = 0.056 in Figure 3A) and was not
reproduced with Birb 0796, a structurally unrelated p38 MAPK
inhibitor (Supplementary Figure S3A at http://www.BiochemJ.
org/bj/428/bj4280281add.htm). In contrast PD184352, a MEK1/2

BDNF regulates the miR-212/132 genomic locus

(A) miR-132 and miR-212 map to the first intron of a non-coding mRNA gene on chromosome
11 in the mouse genome. The presence of the three exons predicted from mouse ESTs are
indicated (white boxes). The positions of miR-132 and miR-212 in the first intron of this gene
(vertical lines) and potential poly-adenylation sites (AATAAA) (grey vertical lines) are shown.
The position of the various primer sets used for Q-PCR are marked. Sequences for these primers
are given in Supplementary Table S2 (at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/428/bj4280281add.htm).
(B) Primary cortical neuronal cultures were stimulated for the indicated times with 50 ng/ml
BDNF. Total RNA was isolated, and the fold induction of the processed non-coding transcript
was determined by Q-PCR. Primers amplifying mRNA derived from splicing at the exon
1/2 (ex1/ex2) boundary are shown in the left-hand panel; primers detecting splicing at the
exon 2/3 (ex2/ex3) boundary are shown in the right-hand panel. 18S RNA levels were used
to correct for total RNA concentrations. Error bars represent the S.D. for three independent
stimulations. (C) As in (B), but Q-PCR was used to determine the absolute levels of sequences
from intron 1, exon 2, intron 2 and exon 3. All four Q-PCRs were quantified relative to a standard
curve derived from a plasmid that contained a subclone of miR-212/132 genomic region. 18S
RNA levels were used to correct for total RNA concentrations. Error bars represent the S.D. for

(MAPK/ERK kinase 1/2) inhibitor, that blocks the activation
of ERK1/2, completely blocked the induction of pri-miR212/132 in response to BDNF (Figure 3A). The up-regulation
of the mature miRNA was also determined using a TaqManbased PCR system. As star sequences were also identified
in the sequencing results for both miR-132 and miR-212,
the induction of these sequences was also examined by
Q-PCR. Both miR-132 and miR-212 were up-regulated by BNDF
stimulation and, consistent with the results on the pri-miR212/132, PD184352 blocked the accumulation of the mature
sequences in response to BNDF (Figure 3B). In line with what
was observed for miR-132 and miR-212, the star sequences of
both miRNAs were also up-regulated by BDNF in an ERK1/
2-dependent manner (Figure 3B). To determine absolute levels
for each miRNA, Q-PCR was carried out and levels were
determined relative to a standard curve prepared using a synthetic
oligonucleotide corresponding to each miRNA sequence. This

ERK1/2 signalling is required for pri-miR-212/132 transcription

(A) Primary cortical neurons were incubated for 1 h in the presence of 2 μM PD184352,
5 μM SB203580, 10 μM Kn93, 10 μM PI103 or 5 μM Bi-D1870 as indicated. Cells were
then stimulated for 1 h with 50 ng/ml BDNF and pri-miR-212/132 levels were determined by
Q-PCR. Error bars represent the S.E.M. for three independent stimulations. (B) Primary cortical

to the miRNA sequences. Quantification was carried out for the 4 h (grey bars) and 24 h (black
bars) BDNF-stimulated samples described in (B).

showed that miR-132 was expressed at much higher levels than
miR-132*. Both the miR-212 and miR-212* sequences were
found at similar levels; however, these levels were significantly
lower than that found for miR-132 (Figure 3C). This was
in contrast with the sequencing results which suggested that
miR-212* might be expressed at a higher level than miR-212.
This difference could possibly be due to a ligation bias in the
sequencing library that could result in an over-representation of
miR-212* in the library.

MSK1/2 regulate pri-miR-212/132 transcription via the
phosphorylation of CREB

ERK1/2 is able to regulate transcription both by the direct
phosphorylation of specific transcription factors and by the
activation of downstream kinases, such as RSK (ribosomal S6
kinase) and MSK, that can in turn phosphorylate both transcription
factors and chromatin [22,35]. Bi-D1870, a specific RSK inhibitor

MSKs regulate miR-212/132 transcription

(A) Primary cortical neurons were cultured from wild-type (black bars) or MSK1/2-knockout
(grey bars) mice. Cells were stimulated for the indicated times with 50 ng/ml BDNF and the
fold induction of pri-miR-212/132 was determined by Q-PCR. For both wild-type and knockout
samples, the fold change was calculated relative to the wild-type control samples. Error bars

sequences for both miR-132 and miR-212 were measured.

[36], did not affect the induction in pri-miR-212/132 transcription
in response to BDNF, indicating that ERK1/2 controlled primiR-212/132 induction independently of RSK (Figure 3A).
Analysis of cortical cultures from MSK1/2-double-knockout mice
showed that, although BDNF was able to induce pri-miR-212/132
transcription in these cells, the levels were consistently lower than
those seen in wild-type cells (Figure 4A), suggesting that MSKs
were partially, but not completely, responsible for regulating primiR-212/132 transcription downstream of ERK1/2. Consistent
with this, MSK1/2 knockout also reduced the induction of
the mature and star sequences for both miR-132 and miR-212
(Figure 4B). MSKs have been shown previously to phosphorylate
CREB on Ser133 downstream of ERK1/2 [19,23], and CREB has
been suggested previously to regulate miR-132 transcription [6].
Previous studies in primary cortical neuronal cultures have shown
that CREB phosphorylation in response to BDNF is blocked by the
MEK1/2 inhibitor PD184352 and is greatly reduced by MSK1/2
knockout [23]. Analysis of the genomic sequence around miR132 and miR-212 revealed a 500 bp region upstream of exon 1
that was conserved in mouse and humans, suggesting that this
may contain the critical promoter elements. This 500 bp region
contains a potential Cre site and, in addition, three further potential
Cre consensus sites could be identified in intron 1. To analyse
this further, the region from 3105 bp upstream of exon 1 to the
start of exon 2 was cloned into a luciferase reporter (Figure 5A).
This reporter was induced by BDNF in primary cortical neurons
and, similar to the endogenous gene, its induction was blocked
by PD184352 (Figure 5B). In addition, two truncations of this
promoter were also generated (Figure 5A). These showed that,
although the long form of the promoter had the highest activity,
a short form starting 475 bp 5 to exon 1 also showed significant
induction by BDNF (Figure 5C). This sequence contains all four
of the potential Cre sites (Figure 5A). Deletion of the intron 1

Where indicated, cells were pre-treated for 1 h with 2 μM PD184352. Cells were then stimulated

region (which contains three of the four Cre sites) was sufficient
to greatly reduce expression of the luciferase vector (Figure 4C).
Mutation of the three intronic Cre sequences, however, was not
enough to abolish promoter activity. In contrast, mutation of the 5
Cre site did reduce the induction of the reporter, whereas mutation
of all four Cre sites resulted in an even greater reduction in the
induction of the reporter by BDNF (Figure 5D). The requirement
for these Cre sites is consistent with a previous report showing that
A-CREB, a dominant-negative inhibitor of CREB, could block
miR-132 induction and that CREB could bind to this region as
judged by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) [6]. Classically,
CREB is regulated by phosphorylation on Ser133 , which creates
a binding site for the co-activator proteins CBP (CREB-binding
protein) or p300 [37,38]. We therefore also examined the role
of CREB in miR-212/132 transcription using mice with an
inducible S133A mutation in the endogenous CREB gene [39].
In this system, a S133A mutation in the CREB gene is induced by
the excision of a wild-type floxed minigene from the endogenous
CREB gene by Cre recombinase. To specifically induce this
mutation in neuronal cells, Cre expression was driven from a

nestin promoter sequence that has been shown previously to
express Cre in neuronal progenitor cells during development [21].
Previous studies have confirmed that primary cortical neuronal
cultures from these mice express the mutated CREB S133A, but
not the wild-type protein [39]. BDNF-induced pri-miR-212/132
transcription was reduced in CREB S133A-knockin neuronal
cultures compared with wild-type cells (Figure 6A). The reduction
in pri-miR-212/132 transcription in CREB S133A-knockin cells
is in line with that seen in the MSK1/2-double-knockout cells, the
kinases responsible for BDNF-induced CREB phosphorylation
(compare Figure 6A with Figure 4A). It is, however, in contrast
with the effect of the MEK inhibitor PD184352 on miR-212/132
transcription, as the inhibitor completely blocked the induction
of this gene by BDNF. This suggests that ERK1/2 may also
regulate miR-212/132 transcription via a second mechanism
independent of MSK1/2 and CREB phosphorylation. To confirm
this, MSK1/2-knockout cells were treated with PD184352. The
residual induction of pri-miR-212/132 seen in these cells was
blocked by PD184352 (Figure 6B).
Regulation of pri-miR-212/132 transcription is not restricted to
neurotrophic signalling

Several other stimuli are known to induce CREB phosphorylation
in neurons. Forskolin elevates cAMP levels, resulting in PKA
(protein kinase A) activation and CREB phosphorylation in a
number of cell types, including cortical neurons, independently
of ERK1/2 and MSK1/2 [22]. Forskolin stimulation resulted
in a sustained increase in pri-miR-212/132 in cortical neurons
(Figure 7A). Consistent with this, forskolin was able to stimulate
the induction of the miR-212/132 promoter construct. Mutation
of the four Cre sites in this construct blocked induction
(Figure 7B). NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), a mimic of the

c The Authors Journal compilation 

neurotransmitter glutamate, could also stimulate pri-miR-212/132
transcription (Figure 7C). Similar to BDNF and forskolin,
NMDA was able to stimulate the wild-type but not Cre
mutant miR-212/132 promoter construct (Figure 7D). NMDA
stimulates CREB phosphorylation via both the CaMK and
ERK1/2 pathways. Inhibition of either of these pathways reduced
NMDA-induced CREB phosphorylation, whereas inhibition of
both pathways had an additive effect (Figure 7E). In line with
this, inhibition of either the ERK1/2 or CaMK signalling cascades
partially blocked pri-miR-212/132 induction by NMDA, whereas
a combination of both inhibitors had an additive effect on pri-miR212/132 transcription (Figure 7F). Both CREB phosphorylation
and pri-miR-212/132 induction by NDMA were blocked by MK801, an NDMA receptor antagonist (Figures 7E and 7F). Induction
of miR-132 and miR-212 was not restricted to neuronal lineages.
Treatment of HeLa cells with either PMA or anisomycin was
able to induce pri-miR-212/132 transcription via the ERK1/2
or p38α MAPK pathway respectively, whereas pri-miR-212/132
transcription was also induced by LPS (lipopolysaccharide) which
activates both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, in THP-1, a human
monocyte cells line, although unexpectedly not by LPS in primary
murine macrophages (Supplementary Figures 3B–3E).

DISCUSSION

The transcriptional up-regulation of specific miRNA genes is
a potential mechanism by which signal transduction cascades
could mediate their cellular functions. Some examples of this
have already been reported; for instance, the induction of the
miR-17/92 cluster by IL-6 (interleukin-6) is reported to be
responsible for the effect of IL-6 on BMPR2 (bone morphogenetic
protein receptor 2) expression [40], whereas the up-regulation
of miR-146a by TLRs (Toll-like receptors) is suggested to
play a role in negative-feedback loops involved in controlling
TLR signalling [41]. BDNF has been shown previously to upregulate miR-132 expression; however, the effect of BDNF on the
expression of other miRNAs has not been addressed previously
[6]. Using Solexa sequencing, BDNF was found to up-regulate
four miRNAs with significant abundances, of which two, miR-132
and miR-212, could be confirmed by TaqMan-based Q-PCR.
Both miR-132 and miR-212 are encoded by a single non-coding
gene. The transcription of pri-miR-212/132 in response to BDNF
was dependent on the activation of ERK1/2. In addition, it was
found that the phosphorylation of CREB by MSKs downstream
of ERK1/2 was also involved in pri-miR-212/132 transcription.
Consistent with a role for CREB, ChIP experiments have shown
previously the binding of CREB to the miR-212/132 locus
[6]. In addition, ERK1/2 also regulated pri-miR-212/132 via
a MSK/CREB Ser133 -phosphorylation-independent mechanism.
The identity of this mechanism is not clear. It is possible
that ERK1/2 could affect the activity of CREB in a manner
independent of Ser133 phosphorylation, for instance by affecting
the recruitment of the CREB co-activator TORC (transducer of
regulated CREB-binding protein). This would be consistent with
the observation that A-CREB, a dominant-negative form of CREB
that prevents CREB binding to DNA, inhibits pri-miR-212/132
transcription in response to BDNF [38]. However, it is also
possible that ERK1/2 may regulate pri-miR-212/132 transcription
via the phosphorylation of a different transcription factor that
has not yet been found to be associated with the miR-212/132
promoter.
The processing and maturation of the miR-212/132 cluster also
bear some remarkable characteristics. The intron that encodes
the miRNA cluster is processed independently and faster than

the rest of the pri-miRNA. This finding supports the view
that intronic miRNAs are processed by the Microprocessor cotranscriptionally a priori to splicing [33]. Additionally, it is
very unusual that miRNAs like miR-212 and miR-132 with
such a low basal expression (judging from the number of the
reads obtained from the sequencing results and the intensity
of Northern hybridizations) show the accumulation of star
sequences. Moreover, all strands derived from this miRNA
cluster respond to BDNF treatment. This may suggest that
there is an active mechanism that facilitates the processing
of all strands from the miR-212/132 cluster generating four
functional miRNAs. In addition, a 19 nt sequence corresponding
to the loop sequence of pre-miR-132 was shown to be increased
upon BDNF treatment. It is unlikely that this sequence is an
additional ‘miRNA’ product from pre-miR-132, but it may
accumulate because it is protected by protein that binds to the loop

when miR-132 is processed. miRNA processing could be posttranscriptionally regulated and proteins that modulate pri- and
pre-miRNA processing have been identified [42–45]. hnRNPA1
(heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1) was shown to
be required for the processing of miR-18 by binding to the
terminal loop of the miRNA [46,47]. In addition, common RNAbinding proteins have been shown to bind to the loops of distinct
miRNAs and are predicted to have similar functions to hnRNPA1
[46]. The common characteristic of these miRNAs is that their
loop sequences are extremely conserved throughout vertebrates,
suggesting that it plays important role in miRNA biogenesis. The
terminal loops of miR-212 and miR-132 are also extremely well
conserved throughout vertebrates, suggesting that they may bind
proteins that regulate their processing. This could explain the
accumulation of the star sequences of both miRNAs and the loop
sequence of the pre-miR-132.

Alignment of miR-132 and miR-212

The mature and star sequences for murine m0069R-212 and niR-132 were aligned. Seed regions
are highlighted.

The miR-212/132 cluster produces four miRNAs; however,
only the function of miR-132 has been studied in neurons.
miR-132 has been implicated previously in regulating neuronal
morphogenesis, in part via the regulation of p250GAP [6,31,48].
Overexpression of miR-132 was found to promote neurite
outgrowth and spine formation, whereas miR-132 inhibitors
reduced these processes [6,31,48,49]. In addition MeCP2 and
SirT1 (sirtuin 1), both of which can act as transcriptional
regulators, have been suggested as targets for miR-132 [50,51].
The seed regions of miR-132 and miR-212 are identical (Figure 8),
suggesting that the two miRNAs will target similar mRNAs.
Analysis of the top 35 hits for miR-132 showed that 33 were
also predicted as miR-212 targets, whereas 32 of the top 35 hits
for miR-212 were also predicted as miR-132 targets. However,
although it is widely considered that miRNAs with identical seed
sequences regulate similar targets, there is increasing evidence
suggesting that perfect seed sequence complementarity is not
always a good predictor for miRNA target recognition [52,53].
In addition, some studies have now shown that complementarity
in the 3 region could also play role in target specificity [54].
It is therefore possible that miR-132 and miR-212 may have
some distinct targets in vivo; however, it is likely that miR-212,
like miR-132, plays a role in regulating neuronal morphology or
transcription in response to neurotrophins or synaptic activity. The
two star sequences carry a mismatch in their seed region and are
also diverse in the 3 region. No experimentally validated targets
have been reported for miR-132* or miR-212*. Predictions using
seed sequences in TargetScan suggest that the two star sequences
will target different mRNAs, although experimental validation
would be required for these targets before predictions could be
made about the functions of these miRNAs.
In summary, we show in the present study that pri-miR-212/132
is produced from the intron of a non-coding immediate early
gene and gives rise to four distinct miRNAs. The transcription
is strongly regulated by ERK1/2 signalling in neurons, in part
through the downstream kinase MSK1 and the phosphorylation
of CREB. Previous studies have suggested roles for both ERK1/2
and miR-132 in the regulation of neuronal morphology [6,31,48].
It will therefore be of interest in future studies to examine the
in vivo roles of both miR-132 and miR-212 in neuronal
development.

Judit Remenyi and Christopher Hunter carried out all of the experimental work, with the
exception of the miRNA sequencing (Hideaki Ando and Soren Impey), bioinformatics
analysis (Christian Cole and Geoffrey Barton), CREB knockins (Kristy Martin), and HeLa
and THP-1 cell work (Claire Monk). Gyorgy Hutvaagner and Simon Arthur helped to plan
the study. All authors were involved in writing the manuscript.
