Dorsey and colleagues estimated that the number of
persons with Parkinson’s disease (PD) in the United
States was approximately 340,000 in 2005 and projected
that number to reach approximately 610,000 in 2030 as
a result of population aging.1 These projections were
made under the simple assumption that the age- and sexspecific prevalence would remain stable over 25 years.
However, the burden of diseases may be modified over
time by human practices, including public health interventions and medicine.2 Rossi and colleagues have suggested that the successful implementation of smoking
cessation interventions in the United States may lead to
an increase in the projected number of persons who will
suffer from PD by 2040.3 Their revised projections were
based on a projected 46.2% increase in the population  50 years old and a 59.8% reduction in the percentage of smokers  50 years old between 2000 and
2040. They also made the fundamental assumption that
smoking has a preventive effect on PD. Based on their
assumptions and on the relatively conservative prevalence estimates published by Dorsey et al for 2005,1 they
projected for 2040 a total of 700,000 patients with PD
because of population aging and an additional 70,000
patients (10% increase) because of the reduced frequency
of smoking (total of 770,000 patients). Overall, they projected a 56% increase in the number of patients between
2005 and 2040. Rossi and colleagues argued that these
revised projections are important to adequately plan for
future cost and care needs related to PD.3
Whether or not smoking has a preventive effect on
the risk of PD, the number of patients with PD is
likely to increase by 2040 above and beyond the simple effect of population aging. There are now 3 studies

from 3 continents showing an increase in the risk of
PD over time (from the United States, Finland, and
Taiwan).4-6 However, there are also 3 studies showing
a possible decline in risk over time (from the United
Kingdom, Taiwan, and the Netherlands).7-9 Assuming
that all 6 studies have adequate methods (no major
biases) and comparable study design, these discrepant
findings may suggest that the risk factors for PD vary
across countries, by sex, and over time. Our study in
Olmsted County, Minnesota, showed an approximately 50% increase in the incidence of PD in men
and women combined over 30 years (1976-2005; relative risk increase). The increase was more sizable in
men age  70 years (approximate relative risk increase
of 100%), and there was a significantly higher risk for
men born between 1915 and 1924 (birth cohort
effect).4 If the increasing trend in the risk of PD
observed in our study is confirmed in other US populations, the impact on prevalence projections for 2040
may be greater than predicted by Rossi et al.3
As recognized by Rossi and colleagues, the association between smoking and reduced risk for PD may be
to some degree noncausal.3 Avoidance of smoking initiation early in life or ease of smoking cessation later
in life may be markers of a preexisting predisposition
to PD (cause-effect inversion).10 This predisposition
may have genetic causes (eg, inherited genetic variants
or epigenetic modifications), intrauterine causes (eg,
infectious, toxic, or dietary exposures), or early developmental causes (eg, early-life infectious, toxic, or dietary exposures). Therefore, other environmental risk
factors (eg, pesticides, infectious agents, and air,
water, or soil pollutants) or other behavioral risk
factors (eg, alcohol, coffee, diet, exercise, or head
trauma) may be more important.11 Interestingly, most
of these environmental or behavioral risk factors have
a different frequency or a different effect in men and
women.12,13
The birth cohort effect observed in the Olmsted
County study may help in establishing the chronology
of etiologic exposures. Men born in the decade from
1915 to 1924 experienced an increased risk for PD
compared with men born in other birth decades, both
before and after. A similar trend was also observed
for women, but the analyses did not reach statistical

significance.4 This birth cohort effect suggests that
exposures that took place during intrauterine life or in
early childhood (eg, infectious, toxic, or dietary exposures) may be more important than cigarette smoking
during adult life.14
A group of Finnish investigators tested a different
etiologic hypothesis. Instead of focusing on the reduction in smoking over time, they correlated the risk of
PD with trends in rural environmental factors, primarily the use of pesticides and the consumption of well
water. Because there has been a trend of reduced use
of pesticides in agriculture and increased access to
clean water (ie, piped water with contamination control) in Finland, they expected to observe a decline in
the incidence of PD and a narrowing of the rural-tourban incidence rate ratio. By contrast, they found an
increase in the risk of PD from 1997 to 2014 in both
rural and urban regions and no reduction in the ruralto-urban incidence risk ratio.6 They suggested that the
effects of rural environmental factors may have a long
latency, and many decades may be required before an
environmental change will modify the risk of PD. The
time frame may be particularly long if the most
important environmental exposures take place during
intrauterine life or in the first years of life.
In conclusion, I agree with Rossi and colleagues that
the projections published by Dorsey and colleagues in
2007 should be revised. However, I think that the
increase in the number of patients with PD projected
for 2040 may not be simply due to a change in smoking patterns, but rather to a number of more complex
environmental and behavioral changes. If the trends
observed in Olmsted County for 1976 to 2005 continue after 2005 and are confirmed in other US populations, the projected number of persons affected by
PD in the United States by 2040 may be much higher
than predicted by Rossi et al.3 The number of persons
affected by PD in 2040 will depend on changes over
time in the age- and sex-specific prevalence of PD
(number of patients per 100 persons in the population) and on changes in the demographic structure of
the population (population aging because of the
increase in life expectancy). In turn, the changes in

prevalence percentages will depend on changes in incidence rates or risk of PD and on the length of survival
of patients after they develop PD. Any change in incidence rates and survival in PD patients or changes in
the demographic structure of the population in the
coming decades may modify the projections. There is
an urgent need for additional studies of the risk and
protective factors for PD that may prompt preventive
interventions to reduce the future burden of PD.
