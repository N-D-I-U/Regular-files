Nurr1 is a transcription factor essential for the genesis of
ventral dopaminergic neurons. In this study, we investigated the expression of Nurr1 protein and mRNA in the
adult rat brain by using immunohistochemistry and in situ
hybridization, respectively. Another aim of our study was
to investigate Nurr1 expression in substantia nigra after
dopamine depletion induced by the injection of
6-hydroxydopamine in the striatum. We observed that
Nurr1 mRNA and protein are expressed in several brain
regions, including cortex, hippocampus, substantia
nigra, and ventral tegmental area, in agreement with
previous reports using in situ hybridization. Additionally,
we found that Nurr1 is expressed in brain regions that
have not been previously reported, such as striatum,
septum, and superior colliculus. Highest levels of expression were found in cortex, medial septum, dentate gyrus,
some hypothalamic nuclei, and substantia nigra. Interestingly, we observed that, in the superior colliculus,
Nurr1 protein is localized in the cytoplasm of cells,
whereas, in other regions, it was localized mainly in the
nuclei, suggesting that Nurr1 subcellular localization is
regulated and may have functional implications. Dopamine
depletion induced by an injection of 6-hydroxydopamine
into the striatum produced an increase in the number of
cells expressing Nurr1 mRNA and protein in both substantia nigra compacta and substantia nigra reticulata, ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesioned side, measured 24 hr
after the 6-hydroxydopamine injection. These results suggest that Nurr1 may be involved in many neuronal functions
in the adult central nervous system and, in particular, might
be related to the compensation processes that take place in
dopaminergic cells in order to normalize extracellular dopamine levels in the striatum. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Nurr1 (for nuclear receptor-related factor 1,
NR4A2) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor
superfamily (Law et al., 1992; Peña de Ortiz and Jamieson,
1996). Nurr1, together with the orphan receptors Nur77
and Nor-1, conforms the NUR subfamily, in which all
members bind the same cis-acting consensus sequence

(NBRE, NGFI-B-response element) to regulate the expression of target genes. NUR subfamily members are
products of immediate-early genes, whose expression can
be rapidly induced in response to a variety of stimuli,
including growth factors, neurotransmitters, and depolarization (Law et al., 1992; Honkaniemi et al., 1995, 2000;
Honkaniemi and Sharp, 1996; Nakki et al., 1996; Peña de
Ortiz et al., 1996; Xing et al., 1997).
Nurr1 is expressed in several regions of the developing and adult central nervous system (CNS; SaucedoCardenas and Conneely, 1996; Xiao et al., 1996; Zetterström et al., 1996a,b). Expression of Nurr1 in mice is
detected at embryonic day 10.5 in ventral midbrain, the
region where mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons develop (Zetterström et al., 1996b). Various studies have
revealed that Nurr1 is absolutely essential for the induction
of dopaminergic neurons in mice midbrain (Zetterström et
al., 1997; Castillo et al., 1998a;Saucedo-Cardenas et al.,
1998). Mice lacking Nurr1 fail to generate dopaminergic
neurons in midbrain and die soon after birth. Some reports
have suggested that, in addition to the demonstrated role of
Nurr1 in the acquisition of ventral dopaminergic phenotype,
Nurr1 is important in the regulation of the ventral dopaminergic system in the adult. In fact, heterozygous Nurr1⫹/–
mice are more vulnerable to the dopaminergic neurotoxin
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
than controls, showing a diminished capacity to recover
dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum (CS) after the damage
induced by MPTP (Le et al., 1999). On other hand, Tseng
and coworkers (2000) reported that Nurr1 mRNA expression increases signiﬁcantly in mesencephalic dopaminergic
neurons in mice null for D2 receptors, suggesting a regulatory
interaction between Nurr1 and this dopaminergic system. In

Increased Nurr1 After Dopamine Depletion

addition, a recent report showed a signiﬁcant decrease of
Nurr1 expression associated with a reduced expression of DA
transporter (DAT) in ventral dopaminergic neurons of cocaine abusers (Bannon et al., 2002). It is unknown which
processes are regulated by Nurr1 in vivo. However, several
studies with cell cultures suggest that Nurr1 could regulate
the expression of dopaminergic-speciﬁc genes, such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and DAT. In this regard, it has been
shown that forced Nurr1 expression in hippocampal neuronal precursors induces TH expression (Sakurada et al., 1999).
Also, recombinant Nurr1 overexpressed in cell lines induces
the expression of reporters coupled to TH and DAT promoters (Iwawaki et al., 2000; Sacchetti et al., 2001). Interestingly, mutations in the NR4A2 gene found in individuals
affected with Parkinson’s disease decrease both Nurr1 and
TH mRNA levels (Le et al., 2003).
Various reports have suggested, in addition to the
role of Nurr1 in the induction and regulation of ventral
dopaminergic neurons in the brain, a wider functional
inﬂuence of this transcription factor in other systems. Peña
de Ortiz and her group (2000) found that Nurr1 expression increases in CA1 and CA3 subregions of the dorsal
hippocampus during spatial discrimination learning, suggesting an important role for Nurr1 in long-term information storage. Also, it has been reported that Nurr1
expression increases transiently in the hippocampus after
electroconvulsive seizures (Xing et al., 1997) and kainic
acid-induced seizures (Crispino et al., 1998).
We were interested, in view of the important functions of Nurr1 in the ventral dopaminergic system, in
studying the expression of Nurr1 mRNA and protein after
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) dopaminergic-terminal
lesion in the CS of the rat. To this end, ﬁrst, we characterized the regional and subcellular localization of Nurr1
mRNA and protein in the CNS of the rat. Second, we
characterized the effect of 6-OHDA injections in the CS
by measuring time-dependent changes in DA extracellular
levels in the CS with microdialysis. Here we report that
the injection of 6-OHDA in the CS induces a massive and
rapid efﬂux of DA, followed by a continual decrease until
the extracellular levels of DA become undetectable. This
effect was associated with a bilateral increase of Nurr1
mRNA and protein expression in the substantia nigra
(SN), measured 24 hr after the 6-OHDA injection. These
results suggest that DA extracellular levels in the CS regulate the expression of Nurr1 in the SN of the rat and that
the augmented expression of Nurr1 could be related to the
compensation processes that occur in order to normalize
DA extracellular levels in the CS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Rats were obtained from the Animal Service Unit, Catholic University of Chile, and were handled according to the
regulations stipulated by the Catholic University of Chile and by
The Animal Care and Use Committee of FONDECYT.
Animal Studies
Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (weighing 250 –300 g)
were deeply anesthetized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with chloral

687

hydrate (400 mg/kg) and mounted in a stereotaxic apparatus
(Stoelting). Twenty micrograms per four milliliters of 6-OHDA
prepared in 0.02% ascorbic acid were injected in the right CS at
a rate of 1 ␮l/min using a Hamilton microsyringe. Coordinates
for the placement of the Hamilton syringe tip with regard to
Bregma were A 1.2 mm, L 2.8 mm, and V 4.5 mm, according
to the Paxinos and Watson atlas (1986). Sham-operated rats
were stereotaxically injected with 0.02% ascorbic acid under the
same conditions. Twenty-four hours after the lesion, rats were
processed for histochemical studies as follows. Rats were deeply
anesthetized with chloral hydrate and then killed by perfusion
through the left cardiac ventricle with 0.9% NaCl, followed by
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), pH 9.5.
Brains were then removed from the skull, cut into blocks,
postﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr, and ﬁnally maintained in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB containing 0.9% NaCl (PBS)
during 48 hr at 4°C. Vibratome or cryostat serial brain coronal
sections (30 ␮m) were collected and washed three times in
0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4, to be processed for in situ hybridization
(ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Microdialysis and DA Detection
Microdialysis and DA detection were performed essentially as described by Andrés and collaborators (1998). Brieﬂy,
rats were deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg
i.p.), and supplemental doses were administered as needed to
maintain anesthesia during the experiment. A concentric microdialysis probe (MD-2262; CMA, Acton, MA) was implanted
into the right CS. The probe was continuously perfused at a rate
of 2 ␮l/min with a Krebs Ringer phosphate buffer (in mM: 120
NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 1.2 CaCl, 0.9 NaH2PO4, 1.4 Na2HPO4, pH
7.4) using a Harvard infusion pump (model 22). After a 30-min
stabilization period, perfusion samples were collected every
5 min in 3 ␮l of 0.2 N perchloric acid and maintained on ice
until DA determination by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to electrochemical detection (EC).
Then, 20 ␮g of 6-OHDA dissolved in 4 ␮l of 0.01% ascorbic
acid were injected in CS through the lateral infusion tube of the
microdialysis probe. After 1 hr, when the interfering signal of
6-OHDA was not detected in the HPLC-EC system, again
5-min perfusion samples were taken and assayed for DA content
during the next 2 hr. The HPLC-EC system was conﬁgured
with one piston pump (Shimadzu), a SepStick microbore column (BAS), and an amperometric detector LC4C (BAS). The
mobile phase contained 0.1 M NaH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
1-decanesulfonic acid, pH 3.2, and it was pumped at a ﬂow rate
of 70 ␮l/min. The potential of the amperometric detector was
set at 650 mV. Under these experimental conditions, the retention time was 7 min for 6-OHDA and 13 min for DA. The
routine limit of detection was 0.05 pg for DA.
ISH
ISH was performed according to Andrés and collaborators
(1996). In brief, an oligonucleotide, “Nurr-44” (5⬘-gac ctc acc
aac act gaa att act gcc acc act tct ctc cc-3⬘), complementary to
nucleotides 133–173 of rat Nurr1 cDNA, that also recognizes
Nurr1a but not Nurr2 cDNAs, was 3⬘-end labeled with digoxigenin (DIG)-dUTP using terminal transferase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Free-ﬂoating brain sections were prehybridized

688

Ojeda et al.

during 1 hr at 62°C in 5⫻ SSC (1⫻ SSC ⫽ 0.15 M NaCl,
0.015 M sodium citrate) and Denhardt’s solution [Denhart’s
100⫻: 2% ﬁcoll; 2% polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and 2% bovine
serum albumin (BSA)]. The hybridization was performed overnight at 38°C with 10 pmol/ml of the labeled probe in a
solution containing 50% formamide, 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), 12 mM Tris HCl, 0.12 M NaCl, 0.8 mM EDTA, and
0.02 g/ml Sarcosyl, pH 7.5. After hybridization, tissue slices
were rinsed with SSC (2⫻, 1⫻, 0.5⫻, and 0.1⫻ for 10 min
each) at 50°C. The presence of DIG oligonucleotide was detected with an anti-DIG antibody conjugated with alkaline
phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN). Nitroblue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl
phosphate (Gibco-BRL, Grand Island, NY) were used as enzyme substrates. Finally, sections were mounted on glass slides
with gelatin (0.1%), dried, and coverslipped.
IHC
Endogenous peroxydase activity was exhausted by incubating the free-ﬂoating tissue sections in 0.5% H2O2 for 10 min.
Tissue sections were then incubated in blocking solution (1.5%
normal goat serum; 0.1% BSA, and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS)
for 30 min, followed by incubation for 72 hr at 4°C with either
of two rabbit polyclonal anti-Nurr1 antibodies (N-20 1:500 and
M-196 1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).
Tissue sections were washed in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100
(3 ⫻ 10 min), incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG
(Vectastain ABC method) in 1.5% normal goat serum in PBS for
2 hr, and washed in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (3 ⫻ 10 min).
The immunoreactivity was visualized with a standard ABC
method (Vector Elite kit, 2 ␮l of avidin, 2 ␮l of biotin in 1 ml
of PBS for 2 hr). Peroxidase was reacted with 0.05% diaminobenzidine (DAB; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 0.01% H2O2 for
5–10 min. Finally, the sections were mounted on gelatin-coated
slides, air dried, and coverslipped. Photomicrographs were taken
with a camera connected to a light microscope (Nikon
Labophot-2).
Data Analysis
Brain sections from ISH and IHC were examined in a
light microscope (Nikon Labophot-2) equipped with a video
camera (Sony CCD-Iris) and coupled to a Macintosh computer.
Quantiﬁcation analyses were performed using a ﬁnal magniﬁcation of 200⫻. Positive cells for immunostaining and hybridization signals were counted using NIH Image/ppc 1.61. From
each animal, three independent areas of 0.9 mm2 for the CS
(Bregma: 0.48) and 0.15 mm2 for SN compacta (SNc) and SN
reticulata (SNr; Bregma: – 6.04) of each of three coronal slides
were counted. Data are presented as mean ⫾ SEM of at least
three independent experiments. Groups were compared using
an unpaired Student’s t-test. The null hypothesis was rejected at
P ⬍ .05. Photomicrographs were taken with a camera (Nikon
FDX-35) coupled to the Labophot-2 microscope.
Western Blot
The speciﬁcity of anti-Nurr1 antibody (N20; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) was evaluated on Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts from brain nuclei and HEK-293 cells transfected
with a recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged Nurr1

expression vector. The nuclear extracts were obtained essentially
as described elsewhere (Dignam et al., 1983). Brieﬂy, dissected
brain nuclei or cultured cells were homogenized by syringe
passing in buffer A [20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
10 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
ﬂuoride (PMSF)]. After 2 min of centrifugation at 14,000g, the
supernatant was saved as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was
then resuspended in buffer C (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 20% glycerol, 0.42 M KCl, 1 mM
DTT, and 1 mM PMSF) and kept on ice for 30 min with
agitation. Finally, the suspention was centrifuged at 14,000g for
20 min, and the supernatant was saved as the nuclear fraction.
The anti-Nurr1 antibody speciﬁcity was further evaluated on
Western blot and IHC analysis using anti-Nurr1 antibody in the
presence of equimolar amounts of the N-20 blocking peptide
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). HA-Nurr1 expression vector was
generated by cloning a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product containing the full-length Nurr1 cDNA (generously donated by Dr. G. Xing, National Institute of Mental Health,
NIH) into pCGN vector (kindly donated by Dr. Jim Trimmer,
SUNY Stony Brook). The construct was fully sequenced to
check frame and ﬁdelity of the sequence.
Reverse Transription-PCR
Total RNA from CS and SN was isolated with Trizol
reagent (Gibco-BRL). One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo-dT12–18 by MMLV reverse transcriptase, following the manufacturer’s protocol (Gibco-BRL).
PCR was performed using Nurr1 primers (390F: 5⬘-CCTGACTATCAGATGAGTGG-3⬘; 548R: 5⬘-CAGTTTGGACAGGTAGTTGG-3⬘) as follows: 35 cycles for 30 sec at 94°C, 30 sec
at 50°C, 30 sec at 72°C, and a ﬁnal extension at 72°C for
10 min. Primers were designed to amplify a region containing an
alternative splice site, allowing us to distinguish Nurr1 of spliced
variants Nurr1a/Nurr2 cDNAs by size.

RESULTS
Localization of Nurr1 Expression in the Brain
In situ localization of Nurr1 mRNA. Results
from ISH studies using a DIG-oligonucleotide probe
complementary to Nurr1 and to the spliced variant
Nurr1a mRNAs showed that the distribution pattern of
Nurr1 mRNA in adult rat brain is wider than previously
reported. In fact, hybridization was detected in scattered
cells with intense signal in the CS (Fig. 1D,F). Also, many
cells with moderate signal were seen in the septum (Fig.
2C). Moderate intensity of the hybridization signal was
seen in a high number of cells in SNr (Fig. 3D,F). Few
cells with weak hybridization signal were detected in
superior colliculus (Fig. 2D). Positive cells were also observed in areas already described (see Table I) as cerebral
cortex and in scattered cells through CA1–CA3 and dentate gyrus of hippocampus, and many cells with moderate
intensity signal were observed in SNc (Fig. 3D,E) and few
cells in VTA (Table I). The speciﬁcity of the hybridization
signal observed for the DIG-labeled Nurr1 probe was
veriﬁed by tissue section hybridization with the corresponding DIG-oligonucleotide sense Nurr1 probe. As

the DIG-oligonucleotide probe together with a 100-fold
excess of unlabelled probe (data not shown).

polyclonal anti-Nurr1 antibodies (N-20 and M-196; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) to evaluate the distribution of

Nurr1-like immunoreactivity in the rat brain. Both antibodies gave similar results, although at different concentrations (see Materials and Methods). Because most of the
experiments were carried out with N-20 antibody, the
full-proof speciﬁcity tests were performed for N-20 antibody. The speciﬁcity of N-20 anti-Nurr1 antibody was
tested by two approaches. First, anti-Nurr1 antibody recognized the recombinant HA-Nurr1 from transfected

HEK293 nuclear extracts as well as a faint signal of endogenous protein (compare Fig. 4A and B). Second, on
Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasm extracts
from CS, Nurr1 antibody recognized two bands. One of
the bands corresponded to the expected molecular mass of
Nurr1 of 66 kDa; we suggest that the other band of higher
molecular mass could correspond to a posttranslational
modiﬁed form of Nurr1. It is noteworthy that Nur77,
which shares high homology with Nurr1, is detected as a
wide signal in Western blots because of heavy phosphorylation (Woronicz et al., 1995; Cheng et al., 1997). Both
signals were efﬁciently blocked by the presence of
equimolar amounts of the respective immunizing peptide
(Fig. 4C). Moreover, Nurr1-like immunoreactive signal in
brain was totally blocked when tissue slices were incubated
with anti-Nurr1 antibody together with equimolar
amounts of the immunizing peptide (Fig. 1B). The results
of these studies revealed that the Nurr1 antibody used

speciﬁcally recognizes Nurr1 protein. Because this antibody was developed using a peptide corresponding to the
N-terminal of Nurr1 protein, it should recognize both
Nurr1 and the reported spliced variant Nurr1a (Castillo et

Increased Nurr1 After Dopamine Depletion

Fig. 5. Nurr1 and the spliced variants of Nurr1 are expressed in CS and
SN. RT-PCR was performed on total RNA extracted from CS and
SN. One microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed using
oligo-dT. Primer pair speciﬁc for Nurr1 was designed to amplify a
region containing an alternative splice site, allowing us to discriminate
between Nurr1 and the combination of the spliced variants Nurr1a/
Nurr2 cDNAs by size. The expected bands of 494 bp for Nurr1
fragment and 374 bp for Nurr1a/Nurr2 fragment were detected in both

al., 1998b). We did not detect bands of lower molecular
weight on Western blot analysis, suggesting that this isoform of Nurr1 is less expressed and undetectable by this
technique. However, by RT-PCR, we detected a product
corresponding to the expected size for the spliced variants
of Nurr1, Nurr1a, and/or Nurr2 (Castillo et al., 1998b;
Ohkura et al., 1999). To analyze whether Nurr1 spliced
variants are expressed in rat brain, we designed primers
across the alternative splicing site to distinguish by molecular weight the products in a PCR. As shown in Figure 5,
two products were detected by RT-PCR: Nurr1, represented by a more abundant band of 494 bp, and a second,
slighter product of 374 bp corresponding to the presence
of Nurr1a and/or Nurr2 mRNAs in both SN and CS.
This result indicates that the spliced variants of Nurr1 are
less expressed in rat brain and suggests that the Nurr1-like
immunostaining corresponds mostly to Nurr1 protein.
IHC studies of Nurr1 expression in rat brain revealed
a pattern of staining similar to that seen on ISH. Nurr1like immunostaining was localized into the nuclei of scattered but intensely labeled cells in the CS (Fig. 1A,C), in
medial and lateral septum (Fig. 2A,E), and in several cells
throughout SNc and SNr (Fig. 3A–C). A high level of
staining was also seen in cortex, CA1–CA3 and dentate
gyrus of hippocampus, and other areas (see Table I).
Unexpectedly, in superior colliculus, staining was present
in the cytoplasm and processes (Fig. 3B,F), but absent from
the nuclei of the cells (compare Fig. 3E, septum, with F,
superior colliculus). A similar pattern of staining was also
seen in periductal central gray (data not shown). These

results show that Nurr1 is widely expressed in the CNS of
the adult rat, mostly in the nuclei of cells. The different
subcellular distribution seen in other regions may have
functional implications.

the maintenance of the ventral dopaminergic phenotype in
the adult, we have analyzed the expression of Nurr1
mRNA and protein in SN 24 hr after the injection of
6-OHDA in the CS. This model allowed us to study the
early events after the decay of DA in the CS, before cell
degeneration in SN. The DA extracellular levels in the
CS, measured by in vivo brain microdialysis, showed a
massive increase after injection of 6-OHDA, followed by
a continual decrease. DA extracellular levels were undetectable at about 16 hr after the injection of 6-OHDA
(Fig. 6). Twenty-four hours after the injection of
6-OHDA in the CS, a signiﬁcant increase in the number
of cells expressing Nurr1 mRNA was observed in both
SNc and SNr contralateral and ipsilateral to the lesion,
compared with sham rats (Fig. 7A,B). This increase in the
number of cells expressing Nurr1 mRNA was accompanied by a signiﬁcant increase in the number of cells positive for Nurr1-like immunostaining in the ipsilateral and
contralateral SNr, as well as in contralateral SNc, compared with sham condition (Fig. 7C,D). Although not
statistically signiﬁcant, a substantial increase in the number
of Nurr1-like immunoreactive cells was observed in the
ipsilateral side of SNc of 6-OHDA-treated rats (Fig. 7C).

DISCUSSION
Nurr1 Expression in Rat Brain
We observed high Nurr1 protein expression in
areas previously described as positive for Nurr1 mRNA,
including cortex, CA1–CA3 and the dentate gyrus of
the hippocampus, and SNc (Xiao et al., 1996; Zetterström et al., 1996b;Bäckman et al., 1999; Bafﬁ et al.,
1999). Moreover, we observed Nurr1 mRNA and protein expression in CS and SNr, which have also been
reported as positive for Nurr1 mRNA (Xiao et al.,
1996). It is worthwhile noting that Xiao and collaborators also used a DIG-labeled probe to detect Nurr1
mRNA, suggesting that this type of signal gives a better
signal/noise ratio, allowing the detection of ISHpositive cells with lower mRNA expression levels. Interestingly, we observed a high Nurr1 expression in
lateral and medial areas of the septum, a limbic nucleus,

and in the superﬁcial gray layer of the superior colliculus,
an important area in visual-motor integration. The wide
distribution of Nurr1 in the CNS suggests an ample role
for this transcription factor beyond the ventral dopaminergic system. In fact, it has been reported that Nurr1 is
strongly overexpressed following seizure activity (Xing et
al., 1997; Crispino et al., 1998; Honkaniemi and Sharp,
1999) and during spatial discrimination learning (Peña de
Ortiz et al., 2000) in the hippocampus, suggesting that
Nurr1 may play a role in plastic changes in the CNS. In
general, most Nurr1-immunopositive cells were strongly
stained in the nuclei, whereas staining in the cytoplasm
was weak or absent. Cytoplasmic expression of Nurr1 was
observed in the superior colliculus and in the periacueductal gray nuclei. This cytoplasmic localization suggests
that speciﬁc signals could regulate the trafﬁc of Nurr1 to
the nuclei of the cells in these regions of the CNS. It is
tempting to suggest that Nurr1 could behave like a type I
class of nuclear receptor in some areas and to be strictly
nuclear in other areas, responding to different signals in
distinct tissues.

Increased Nurr1 After Dopamine Depletion

DA Terminal Damage Increases Nurr1 Expression
In this work, we evaluated the early events induced
by a rapid and massive decrease of DA in the CS. We
found that, 24 hr after a unilateral 6-OHDA injection in
the CS, a signiﬁcant increase in the number of cells expressing Nurr1 occurs bilaterally in the SNc and SNr of
the rat. The intrastriatal 6-OHDA injection induced an
initial massive efﬂux of DA, followed by a continual
decrease until DA extracellular levels were undetectable.
The number of cells in the SNc remained normal 3 days
after the injection of 6-OHDA in the CS, as assessed by
Nissl staining (Iwata et al., 2001). Also, the number of
neurons expressing TH in the SN showed no alteration
24 hr (Martı́ et al., 2002) or 3 days (Iwata et al., 2001) after
the injection of 6-OHDA in the CS. Indeed, it has been
reported that DA neuronal degeneration in the ipsilateral
SN begins only 1 week after 6-OHDA intrastriatal injection (Sauer and Oertel, 1994; Lee et al., 1996). Therefore,
we can exclude neuronal loss in the SN in the moment
when positive cells for Nurr1-like immunoreactive and
Nurr1 mRNA were counted. Our results support the
hypothesis that DA levels in the CS could regulate the
expression of Nurr1 in the ventral dopaminergic system,
proposed initially by Tseng and coworkers (2000). In fact,
these authors showed that Nurr1 mRNA is overexpressed
in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons in mice null for
D2 class DA receptor. The decrease in DA extracellular
levels in the CS induced by 6-OHDA resembles the
incapacity of the dopaminergic terminals to detect extracellular levels of DA because of the absence of D2 class DA
autoreceptors. In addition, a decrease of Nurr1 immunoreactivity has been shown in ventral neurons of cocaine
abusers (Bannon et al., 2002). It is well documented that
chronic treatment with cocaine or other abused drugs
induces an increase of DA extracellular levels in the nucleus accumbens and in the CS (Di Chiara and Imperato,
1988). Taken together, these results argue in favor of the
idea that DA extracellular levels in the CS may regulate
Nurr1 expression in ventral dopaminergic neurons.
One interesting observation is the bilateral increase
of Nurr1 expression in the SN after unilateral striatal DA
decrease. Although unilateral lesions with 6-OHDA in the
CS do not change the DA storage in the contralateral side
(Matsuura et al, 1997), it has been reported that the
stimulation of one nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway inﬂuences the activity in the contralateral pathway (Nieoullon et al., 1977). Other authors have also reported bilateral
changes in response to unilateral DA depletion. For instance, Delfs and coworkers (1996) have reported a bilateral increase of glutamate decarboxylase mRNA in the
reticular thalamic nucleus. Porter and coworkers (1994)
observed a bilateral decrease of MK-801 binding in CS,
whereas our group showed a bilateral increase in
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) NR1 mRNA in the CS
(Andrés et al., 1996) after unilateral middle forebrain bundle lesion. Rodrı́guez-Puerta and coworkers (1999) have
shown a bilateral increase in the levels of metabotropic
glutamate receptor subtype 4 mRNA in both neocortex

695

and neostriatum. Steiner and Kitai (2001) reported a bilateral reduction in cortical zif 268 expression 2 days after
unilateral infusion of 6-OHDA into the midbrain. Electrophysiological, biochemical, and behavioral evidence
supports the idea that these bilateral effects might be
mediated through interhemispheric connections (Nieoullon et al., 1977; Leviel et al., 1979; Rodrı́guez et al., 1990;
Roedter et al., 2001). The connection between one cerebral cortex and the contralateral CS and SN could thus
be the ﬁnal pathway by which changes in the activity of
one dopaminergic system induce variations in the contralateral hemisphere.
The mechanism by which endogenous DA would
regulate Nurr1 expression is not known. One possibility is
an up-regulation of Nurr1 expression mediated by a CRE
element located at the NR4A2 promoter (Castillo et al.,
1997; Saucedo-Cardenas et al., 1997; Torii et al., 1999;
Ichinose et al., 1999). D2 autoreceptors are coupled to
Gi/Go and decrease cAMP. An increase in cAMP levels in
the surviving dopaminergic terminals induced by a decreased DA level can activate protein kinase A, which
phosphorylates the transcription factor cAMP response
element-binding protein (CREB). Another possibility is
that the increase of Nurr1 expression results from an
increased dopaminergic cell ﬁring produced by the decrease of DA extracellular levels. In fact, chronic K⫹ and
electrical stimulation of dissociated primary sensory neurons (Brosenitsch and Katz, 2001) and PC-12 cells (Law et
al., 1992) induces a rapid increase of Nurr1 expression.
How might the increase in Nurr1 expression affect
the dopaminergic system? It has already been demonstrated that Nurr1 is an essential factor in the acquisition of
the ventral dopaminergic neuronal phenotype. In adults,
Nurr1 may play a critical role in phenotype maintenance
and survival of ventral dopaminergic neurons by regulating the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), DA
transporter (DAT), and Ret, one component of the glialderived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptors. The characterization of TH (Shimmel et al., 1999; Iwawaki et al.,
2000) and DAT (Sacchetti et al., 1999) promoters showed
the presence of NBRE elements, and, in fact, a body of
evidence suggests that Nurr1 regulates the transcription of
these dopaminergic genes (Sakurada et al., 1999; Iwawaki
et al., 2000; Sacchetti et al., 2001). On the other hand,
mice null for the Nurr1 gene showed deﬁcient Ret
mRNA expression in midbrain dopaminergic neurons
(Wallen et al., 2001). It has been proposed that compensation mechanisms operate to maintain DA extracellular
levels in the CS of animals with dopaminergic system
damage (for review see Zigmond and Hastings, 1998).
Increased discharge of dopaminergic neurons and increased DA synthesis and release are among the mechanisms proposed to play a role in compensation. Several
authors have reported an increase in TH (Wolf et al.,
1989; Blanchard et al., 1995) and in Ret expression
(Noriega et al., 2000) in the SN of animals with nigrostriatal system damage. Marco and collaborators (2002)
showed that mRNA levels of Ret and GFR␣1 increase

696

Ojeda et al.

transiently in SNc shortly after intrastiatal 6-OHDA injection, suggesting that the GFR␣1/Ret complex is involved in the regulation of dopaminergic neuron survival.
Our results support the hypothesis that a reciprocal regulation between Nurr1 and endogenous DA levels may
exist in the ventral dopaminergic system. A decrease in DA
levels induces an increase in Nurr1 expression (this study),
which could result in a compensatory increase of TH
transcription and a protective increase in Ret expression to
compensate for the diminution of DA extracellular levels
in CS. Le and coworkers (1999) have shown, in support of
this hypothesis, an increased vulnerability to MPTP in
Nurr1⫹/– mice. The increased Nurr1 expression in SN
may be related to the increased TH and Ret expression
observed after nigrostriatal denervation. Whether the increase in Nurr1 expression lasts longer in dopaminergic
surviving neurons awaits clariﬁcation.
