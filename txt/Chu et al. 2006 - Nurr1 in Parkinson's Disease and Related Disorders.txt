ABSTRACT
In mammals, the transcription factor Nurr1 is expressed early in development and
continues to be detectable throughout the organism’s lifetime. Nurr1 is involved in the
establishment and maintenance of the dopaminergic phenotype within speciﬁc central nervous system neuronal subpopulations including the nigrostriatal dopamine system. This
protein is reduced over the course of normal aging, which is a major risk factor for Parkinson’s
disease (PD). However, whether Nurr1 expression is affected by PD has not been documented. The present study examined the role of Nurr1 in the maintenance of the dopaminergic phenotype within neurons in substantia nigra in PD compared with patients with
diagnoses of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or agematched-matched controls. In PD, the optical density (OD) of Nurr1 immunoﬂuorescence was
signiﬁcantly decreased in nigral neurons containing ␣-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions.
Similarly, the OD of Nurr1 immunoﬂuorescence intensity in the nigra of AD cases was
decreased in neurons with neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs). In contrast to PD and AD, the OD
of Nurr1 immunoﬂuorescence intensity was severely decreased in the neurons with or
without NFTs in PSP cases. Decline of Nurr1-ir neuronal number and OD was observed
within substantia nigra (SN) neurons in PD but not within hippocampal neurons. The decline
in Nurr1-ir expression was correlated with loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoﬂuorescence
across the four groups. These data demonstrate that Nurr1 deﬁciency in dopaminergic
neurons is associated with the intracellular pathology in both synucleinopathies and tauopathies. J. Comp. Neurol. 494:495–514, 2006. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Nurr1, an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is highly expressed in the developing and adult
ventral midbrain and is required for the acquisition and
maintenance of the dopaminergic phenotype in nigrostriatal neurons (Zetterstrom et al., 1997; Saucedo-Cardenas
et al., 1998; Sacchetti et al., 2001; Chu et al., 2002; Hermanson et al., 2003). In the absence of Nurr1, developing
ventral midbrain neurons fail to express the dopaminergic
(DA) neuronal markers tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and
dopamine transporter (DAT), as well as the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling subunit Ret (Zetterstrom et al.,
1997; Saucedo-Cardenas et al., 1998; Wallen et al., 2001;
Sacchetti et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2002, 2003). Moreover,
Nurr1-deﬁcient embryonic ventral midbrain neurons are
unable to innervate their striatal target area (SaucedoCardenas et al., 1998; Zetterstrom et al., 1997). Newborn

ridine (MPTP) than their wild-type littermates (Le et al.,
1999), indicating that Nurr1 inﬂuences the ability of DA
neurons to resist MPTP toxicity. Conversely, a dopaminergic phenotype can be generated in embryonic stem cells
following ex vivo transfection with the Nurr1 gene (Kim et
al., 2002).
Recent studies indicate that Nurr1 expression is decreased during the course of normal human aging (Chu et
al., 2002). Aging is the single most powerful risk factor for
developing Parkinson’s disease (PD). Loss of striatal dopamine and degeneration of DA neurons in the substantia
nigra (SN) are the neurochemical signatures of this disease and occur early in the disease process (Kastner et al.,
1993; Ross et al., 2004). We hypothesize that decreased
Nurr1 expression within individual nigral neurons is a
critical molecular event underlying decreased production
of dopamine and DA neuronal degeneration. Although
decreases in nigral neuronal number and dopamine were
established long ago in PD (Braak et al., 2003), it is essential to determine whether transcription factors such as
Nurr1 contribute to these changes.
In this regard, the purpose of this study was to determine 1) whether Nurr1 immunoreactivity is altered in the
remaining SN neuromelanin (NM)-containing neurons in
PD; and 2) whether a decrease in Nurr1 is associated with
␣-synuclein inclusions. To accomplish these aims, the relative level of Nurr1 protein was analyzed by using quantitative immunoﬂuorescence intensity measurements
within the SN of PD cases. These data were compared
with ﬁndings seen in age-matched controls as well as the
related disorders progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)
and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Because PD is a synucleopathy and PSP and AD are tauopathies, we also compared Nurr1 changes in both categories of neurodegenerative diseases. In our cohort we found that Nurr1 was
altered in neurons undergoing disease-related pathology,
as deﬁned by the presence of ␣-synuclein inclusions or
neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs), in contrast to cells without
inclusions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Tissue from 41 subjects with a clinical and neuropathological diagnosis of PD (n ⫽ 15), PSP (n ⫽ 8), and AD (n ⫽
8), as well as age-matched controls (n ⫽ 10) were analyzed. There were no differences in age at the time of
death (P ⬎ 0.05) or postmortem interval (P ⬎ 0.20) among
the four groups examined (Table 1).
All patients with PD and PSP were diagnosed by neurologists in the Section of Movement Disorders in the
Department of Neurological Sciences at Rush University
Medical Center. Post mortem, the clinical diagnosis was
conﬁrmed neuropathologically by neuropathologists at
Rush University Medical Center. For PD, inclusion criteria included a history compatible with idiopathic PD and
at least two of the four cardinal signs (rest tremor, rigidity, akinesia/bradykinesia, and gait disturbance/postural
reﬂex impairment). The Uniﬁed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS “on”) and Hoehn and Yahr staging
(H&Y “on”) were recorded. PD was classiﬁed clinically as
early (H&Y stages 1–2), moderate (H&Y stage 3), or advanced (H&Y stage 4 –5). The pathological diagnosis was
based on ﬁnding Lewy bodies in catecholamine nuclei such

as the SN. Exclusion criteria included familial PD, dementia with Lewy bodies, the Lewy body variant of AD, or the
combination of PD and AD. PSP was characterized clinically by parkinsonism associated with supranuclear ophthalmoplegia and postural reﬂex impairment falling
within 1 year of onset of the clinical syndrome. Neuropathological diagnosis was based on the characterizations
of neuronal loss, gliosis, and NFTs.
AD and age-matched control subjects were all participants in the Religious Order Study, a longitudinal clinicalpathological study of aging and AD, composed of older
Catholic nuns, priests, and brothers. Each participant received a clinical evaluation that included an assessment
for movement disorders. Details of the clinical evaluation
have been reported previously (Chu et al., 2001; Kordower
et al., 2001). A team of investigators led by a neurologist
performed a complete clinical evaluation annually. The
pathological diagnosis in these cases was made by a neuropathologist at Rush University Medical Center. Subjects
without neurological or psychiatric illnesses were included in the control group. AD was diagnosed clinically
by the examining neurologist and by demonstration of
impairment on neuropsychological testing (Chu et al.,
2001). The study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee at Rush University Medical Center. All
cases were neuropathologically evaluated for AD Pathology according to National Institute on Aging/Reagan Institute Criteria.

Tissue preparation
At autopsy, the brains were removed from the calvarium and processed as described previously (Chu et al.,
2001, 2002; Kordower et al., 2001). Brieﬂy, each brain was
cut into 1-cm-thick coronal slabs, by using a Plexiglas
brain slice apparatus, and then hemisected. The left side
brain slabs were frozen and stored at ⫺80°C. The right
side brain slabs were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48
hours at 4°C and cryoprotected in 0.1 M phosphatebuffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) containing 2% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), 10% glycerol for 24 hours followed by
2% DMSO, 20% glycerol in PBS for at least 2 days prior to
sectioning. The ﬁxed slabs containing the SN and hippocampus were cut into 18 adjacent series of 40-␮m-thick
sections on a freezing sliding microtome for this study. All
sections were collected and stored in a cryoprotectant solution prior to processing.

Immunohistochemical procedures
An immunoperoxidase labeling method was used to visualize Nurr1, TH, ␣-synuclein, and paired helical
ﬁlament-1 (PHF-1) in neurons. Nurr1 (E-20, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) is an afﬁnity-puriﬁed rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against amino acids 579 –
598 (P03354). This antibody recognizes a 66-kDa band of
Nurr1 protein in human tissue using immunoblot (Luo et
al., 2003). The ␣-synuclein (LB 509, Zymed, San Francisco, CA), a monoclonal antibody, directly recognizes
amino acids 115–122 of human ␣-synuclein (P37840;
Jakes et al., 1999) and does not react to ␤-synuclein (Spillantini et al., 1997). Reactivity has not been observed with
␥-synuclein. On Western blots, it has been detected as a
⬃18-kDa band corresponding to human ␣-synuclein
(Deepak et al., 2003). The TH antibody (ImmunoStar,
Hudson, WI) is a mouse monoclonal antibody generated

against TH that has been isolated and puriﬁed from rat
PC12 cells. This antibody recognizes an epitope on the outside of the regulatory N-terminus, a protein of 60 kDa by
Western blot. PHF-1 (Ser396/404, gift from Dr. Peter Davies,
Albert Einstein School of Medicine) is a monoclonal antibody
that recognizes the 58-, 55-, and 53-kDa phosphorylated
epitopes of tau proteins (Chiang et al., 1993).
Endogenous peroxidase-containing elements were eliminated by a 20-minute incubation in 0.1 M sodium peroxidate, and background staining was blocked by a 1-hour
incubation in a solution containing 2% bovine serum albumin and either 5% normal goat serum (for Nurr1) or 5%
normal horse serum (for TH, ␣-synuclein, and PHF-1).
Four series of sections through the rostrocaudal SN were
immunostained for Nurr1 (1:1,000), TH (1:10,000),
␣-synuclein (1:5,000), and PHF-1 (1:5,000). As a positive
control, an additional series of sections through the hip-

pocampus from PD and age-matched controls were immunostained for Nurr1 and processed as above. All immunohistochemical reactions were completed with 0.05% 3⬘⬘3diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 0.005% H2O2. Sections were
mounted on gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated through
graded alcohol, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped with
Cytoseal (Richard-Allan Scientiﬁc, Kalamazoo, MI).

Double-label immunoﬂuorescence
A double-label immunoﬂuorescence procedure was employed to determine whether Nurr1 expression within nigral neurons in PD was altered in neurons that coexpressed TH, ␣-synuclein, or PHF-1. To assess the intensity
of Nurr1 and TH within SN neurons, the immunoﬂuorescence was performed with Cy5, a ﬂuorophore in the infrared range. The autoﬂuorescence from lipofuscin is minimized within this range of the visual spectrum. Sections

through the SN from each brain were incubated in the
ﬁrst primary antibody Nurr1 (1:500) or TH (1:500; polyclonal antibody; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) overnight at
room temperature. This rabbit polyclonal TH antibody
recognizes a 59-kDa band of TH protein in human tissue
under sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) reducing conditions,
using immunoblot (Zhu et al., 1999).
Following six washes in TBS, the sections were sequentially incubated with goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to
Cy5 (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA)
for 1 hour. After six washes in TBS, the sections were
blocked again for 1 hour in a solution containing 5% goat
serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.3 % Triton X-100
in TBS. Sections were then incubated in the second primary ␣-synuclein (1:2,500) or PHF-1 (1:2,500) monoclonal
antibody overnight, separately, at room temperature. After six washes, the sections were incubated sequentially in
goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to cy2 (1:200; Jackson
ImmunoResearch) for 1 hour. The sections were mounted
on gelatin-coated slides, dehydrated through graded alcohol, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped with DPX. The
double labeling of Nurr1 and NeuN (1:1,000 monoclonal
antibody; Chemicon) in the hippocampal neurons or TH
(1:5,000; monoclonal antibody) in the SN neurons was
performed separately using the same method.

STEREOLOGY
The number of Nurr1-immunoreactive (Nurr1-ir) and
TH-ir positive or Nurr1-ir and TH-ir negative neuromelanin
(NM) neurons within the substantia nigra was estimated
stereologically by using an optical fractionator unbiased
sampling design (West et al., 1991; Kordower et al., 2001;
Chu et al., 2002). An investigator blinded to the clinical and
pathological data performed all analyses. In each case, we
evaluated a major portion of the SN that extended from the
caudal level of the mammillary bodies to the decussation of
the superior cerebellar peduncle. The rostral portion of the
SN was not included in the stereological analysis, because it
was detached from the brainstem block.
Approximately seven equispaced sections for each
marker along the SN were sampled from each brain. The
section sampling fraction (ssf) was 1/0.055. The distance
between sections was approximately 0.72 mm. In cross
section, the SN is located in the ventral midbrain. It has
an ellipsoid shape oriented diagonally from ventromedial
to lateral and is deﬁned ventrally by the cerebral peduncle
and medially by the third cranial nerve rootlets. The SN
was outlined using a 1.25⫻ objective. A systematic sample
of the area occupied by the SN was made from a random
starting point (StereoInvestigator 2000 software; MicroBrightField, Colchester, VT). Counts were made at regular predetermined intervals (x ⫽ 313 ␮m; y ⫽ 313 ␮m),
and a counting frame (70 ⫻ 70 ␮m ⫽4,900 ␮m2) was
superimposed on the image of the tissue sections. The area
sampling fraction (asf) was 1/0.05. These sections were
then analyzed by using a 100⫻ Planapo oil immersion
objective with a 1.4 numerical aperture.
The section thickness was empirically determined.
Brieﬂy, as the top of the section was ﬁrst brought into
focus, the stage was zeroed at the z-axis by software. The
stage was then stepped through the z-axis until the bottom of the section was in focus. Section thickness averaged
20.21 ⫾ 2.3 ␮m in the midbrain. The disector height
(counting frame thickness) was 11 ␮m. This method al-

lowed for a 3-␮m top guard zone and at least a 3-␮m
bottom guard zone. The thickness sampling fraction (tsf)
was 1/0.54 in the SN. Care was taken to ensure that the
top and bottom forbidden planes were never included in
the cell counting. The Nurr1-ir, TH-ir, or NM-containing
nigral neurons were only counted if the ﬁrst recognizable
labeled proﬁles came into focus within the counting box.
By using stereological principles, Nurr1-ir, TH-ir, or NM
neurons in each case were sampled using a uniform, systematic, and random design procedure.
The total number of Nurr1-ir, TH-ir, or NM neurons
within the SN was calculated by using the following formula: N ⫽ Q⫺ 䡠 1/ssf 䡠 1/asf 䡠 1/tsf. Q was the total number
of raw counts. The coefﬁcients of error (CEs) were calculated according to the procedure of Schmitz and Hof (2000)
as estimates of precision. The CE values were about 0.05–
0.07 in age-matched controls and AD groups and 0.07–
0.13 in PD and PSP groups. The volume of the SN was
estimated according to Cavalieri’s (1966) principle (Gundersen and Jensen, 1987).

Fluorescence intensity measurements
All immunoﬂuorescence double-labeled images were
scanned with the Olympus Confocal Fluoroview microscope
equipped with argon and krypton lasers. To maintain consistency of the scanned image for each slide, the laser intensity, confocal aperture, PMT voltage, offset, electronic gain,
scan speed, image size, ﬁlter, and zoom were set for the
background level with a control section and maintained
throughout the entire experiment (Chu et al., 2002). Imaging
was performed with a 20⫻ objective and a 488- or 647-nm
excitation source. All optical density (OD) measurements
were performed by using stereological principles of random
and systematic sampling. The intensity mapping sliders
ranged from 0 to 4,095; 0 represented a maximum black
image, and 4,095 represented a maximum bright image. The
Nurr1-ir positive neurons with or without ␣-synuclein-ir inclusions or PHF-1-ir tangles were identiﬁed and outlined
separately by an investigator blinded to the clinical and
pathological data. Quantitative OD of immunoﬂuorescence
intensity was performed on individual Nurr1-ir nuclei with
or without ␣-synuclein-ir inclusions or PHF-1-ir tangles using FLUOVIEW software.
The same methods described above were employed for the
quantitative OD of TH-ir ﬂuorescence intensity measurements. For each marker, ﬁve equispaced sections across the
entire length of the SN were sampled and evaluated. To
account for differences in background staining intensity, ﬁve
background intensity measurements lacking immunoﬂuorescent proﬁles were taken from each section. The mean of
these ﬁve measurements constituted the background intensity. The background intensity was then subtracted from the
measured immunoﬂuorescence intensity of each individual
neuron to provide a ﬁnal immunoﬂuorescence intensity value.
To conﬁrm colocalization of Nurr1 and TH, ␣-synuclein,
or PHF-1 immunoﬂuorescence, optical scanning through
the neuron’s z-axis was performed at 1 ␮m thicknesses,
and neurons suspected of being double labeled were rotated to ensure the accuracy of this observation.

Immunohistochemical controls
Immunohistochemical control experiments included
omission of the primary antibodies (which control for the
speciﬁcity of the staining procedure and the secondary antibody) and replacement of the primary antibodies with irrel-

evant IgG matched for protein concentration. The control
sections were processed in a manner identical to that described above. The adsorption control experiment for Nurr1
antibody was reported previously (Chu et al., 2002). Brieﬂy,
the Nurr1 antibody was combined with a ﬁvefold volume (by
weight) of blocking peptide (sc-990P, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in TBS and incubated overnight at 4°C. The immune
complexes with the antibody and blocking peptide were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 minutes. The adsorbed protein/
antibody complex was then used in lieu of the primary antibody. This resulted in a total absence of staining.
Additionally, the staining patterns for TH (Kitahama et al.,
1990), and ␣-synuclein (Spillantini et al., 1997) were similar
to what has been reported. All control experiments resulted
in the absence of speciﬁc staining.

were performed by using Spearman’s rank correlation. All
signiﬁcance tests used ␣ level set at 0.05 (two-tailed).

Data analysis
The neuronal counts and OD measurements were analyzed by using a factorial analysis of variance model
(ANOVA). When appropriate, post hoc comparisons between groups were performed by using the method of

human midbrain DA neurons contain NM. NM provides an
easily discernible endogenous marker for DA neurons, allowing for an easy assessment of colocalization for Nurr1 in DA
neurons. In the present study, we found that Nurr1 immunoreactivity extensively colocalized with NM-containing

neurons in the SN (Fig. 1). There were only rare Nurr1-ir
nuclei seen in non-NM-containing nigral cells. Confocal microscopic analysis conﬁrmed that Nurr1-ir nuclei colocalized
with TH immunoreactivity in the SN (Fig. 3) and NeuN
immunoreactivity in the hippocampus (Fig. 4).

Alteration of Nurr1-ir neurons in the SN:
qualitative observations

majority of NM neurons were Nurr1-ir, although a few were
Nurr1-ir negative (Fig. 1B). Intense Nurr1-ir granules labeled the entire nucleus but not in the cytoplasm.
A decrease in the number of Nurr1-ir neurons was observed in all PD cases, a fact that is not surprising because

In age-matched control cases, Nurr1-ir neurons were seen
in both the dorsal and ventral tiers of the SN (Fig. 1A). The

Nurr1 extensively colocalizes within nigral neurons. The
extent of Nurr1-ir neuronal loss was dependent on the clinical stage of PD. Qualitative observations indicated that the
loss of Nurr1-ir/NM positive neurons was preferentially seen
within the ventral tier of the SN (Figs. 1C, 5C,E). Additionally there was an obvious diminution in the intensity of
Nurr1 immunoreactivity in moderate stage PD (H and Y
stage 3 “on,” Figs. 1D, 5D). Nurr1 immunoreactivity was
undetectable in many NM-containing cells in PD, indicating
a loss of Nurr1 expression in previously immunopositive
cells (Figs.1D, 5D). In advanced PD, numerous NM neurons
were lost, as expected, regardless of whether they expressed
Nurr1 or not (Fig. 5E,F).
In PSP, qualitative observations indicate an extensive
loss of NM-containing cells, and there was extensive loss
of Nurr1 immunoreactivity within remaining NMcontaining nigral neurons (Fig. 1E,F). In contrast to PD
and PSP, most NM neurons were Nurr1 positive in AD
(Fig. 1G,H).

Alteration of Nurr1-ir neurons in the SN:
quantitative observations
Stereologic estimates of Nurr1-ir/NM positive neurons
in the SN revealed a signiﬁcant loss of cells in the PD and
PSP groups but not in the AD group compared with agematched controls (Table 2). A factorial ANOVA revealed a
statistically signiﬁcant difference in the number of Nurr1ir/NM positive neurons within the SN across the four
groups (F [3, 36] ⫽ 8.89; P ⬍ 0.001). Post hoc analyses
revealed a signiﬁcant difference in the number of Nurr1ir/NM positive neurons between the PD and age-matched
controls (P ⬍ 0.001), PD and AD (P ⬍ 0.01), PSP and
age-matched controls (P ⬍ 0.001), and PSP and AD (P ⬍
0.001). There were no differences between PD and PSP
(P ⬎ 0.05) and AD and age-matched controls (P ⬎ 0.05).
Although the number of Nurr1-ir/NM positive neurons
was signiﬁcantly decreased, the percentage of Nurr1-ir/
negative NM positive neurons was increased in PD
(56.05%), PSP (57.38%) but not in AD (34.79%) relative to
age-matched controls (35.94%), indicating a loss of Nurr1
expression in previously immunopositive neurons.

␣-Synuclein inclusions and neuroﬁbrillary
tangles in SN
␣-Synuclein-ir inclusions and swollen neurites were
seen in all PD cases (Fig. 6D,F). The ␣-synuclein-ir inclusions colocalized with NM-containing nigral perikarya
(Fig. 6D,F). There were two distinct morphological types
of ␣-synuclein-ir inclusions: type I was characterized by
round dark deposits in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6D,F), and type
II was characterized by lightly stained diffuse

␣-synuclein-ir deposits distributed around nigral nuclei
(Fig. 6D). Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that
Nurr1-ir nuclei were barely detected in NM neurons with
type I ␣-synuclein-ir inclusions (Fig. 7D). NM-containing
neurons with type II ␣-synuclein-ir inclusions had minimal levels of Nurr1 immunoreactivity within the nucleus
(Fig. 7D). In contrast to PD, there were no ␣-synuclein-ir
inclusions within the NM-containing perikarya in agematched control cases (Fig. 7A), PSP, and AD. Although
they did not exhibit ␣-synuclein inclusions, PSP and AD
cases did display PHF-1-ir neuroﬁbrillary tangles in the
SN (Figs. 8C–H, 9B,C, 10B,C). There were no PHF-1-ir
NM neurons detected in the SN of age-matched controls
(Figs. 8A,B, 9A, 10A) and PD cases.

Decreased Nurr1 immunoﬂuorescence in
nigral neurons in PD, PSP, and AD
Quantitative ﬂuorescence intensity measurements, performed on individual Nurr1-ir neurons from all cases,
demonstrated that the OD of Nurr1 immunoﬂuorescence
was signiﬁcantly decreased in PD and PSP but not in AD
relative to age-matched controls (F[3,36] ⫽ 41.64; P ⬍
0.001; Fig. 11A). Post hoc analyses revealed a signiﬁcant
difference in the OD of Nurr1-ir neurons between the PD
and age-matched controls (P ⬍ 0.001), PD and AD (P ⬍
0.001), PD and PSP (P ⬍ 0.05), PSP and age-matched
controls (P ⬍ 0.001), and PSP and AD (P ⬍ 0.001), but not
between AD and age-matched controls (P ⬎ 0.05).
We examined the hippocampus as a positive control for
Nurr1 expression. The Nurr1-ir neurons were homogeneously distributed in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus proper and granular cell layer of the dentate
gyrus in PD and age-matched controls (Figs. 2, 4). Qualitative observations indicated that there were no differences in the Nurr1-ir neuronal number in the hippocampus between age-matched controls and PD cases.
Quantitative ﬂuorescence intensity measurement, performed on individual Nurr1-ir pyramidal neurons, revealed that there was no difference in the OD of Nurr1
immunoﬂuorescence intensity between PD (1,255.47 ⫾
34.71) and age-matched controls (1,169.33 ⫾ 164.15; P ⬎
0.05,), illustrating the speciﬁcity of the effects of Nurr1
seen within the SN of PD cases.

Nurr1 immunoﬂuorescence intensity seen in PD was speciﬁc
for cells undergoing ␣-synuclein-mediated degeneration or
whether a similar decrease would be seen in nigral neurons
in other diseases with different intracellular pathologies. In
this regard, quantitative ﬂuorescence intensity measurements, performed on Nurr1-ir neurons in PSP cases, indicated that Nurr1 OD was signiﬁcantly decreased in neurons
both with (298.81 ⫾ 101.50, P ⬍ 0.001;) and without PHF1-ir NFTs (1,331.31 ⫾ 445.93, P ⬍ 0.01) relative to agematched controls (Figs. 9A,C, 11C). In AD, Nurr1 OD was
signiﬁcantly decreased only in the neurons with PHF-1-ir
NFTs (617.17 ⫾ 271.57, P ⬍ 0.001) compared with agematched controls (Figs. 9A, 11D).

brillary tangles, we tested the hypothesis that these neurons display a preferential loss of TH. In this regard, we
examined the OD of TH immunoﬂuorescence in PD nigral
neurons with or without ␣-synuclein inclusions or PSP or
AD nigral neurons with or without NFTs. When all cells
were analyzed together, the OD of TH immunoﬂuorescence intensity, performed on a per neuron basis, was
signiﬁcantly reduced in PD and PSP but not in AD cases
compared with age-matched matched controls (F [3, 36] ⫽
18.02; P ⬍ 0.001; Fig. 11E). Post hoc analyses revealed a
signiﬁcant difference in the OD of TH-ir neurons between
PD and age-matched controls (P ⬍ 0.001), PD and AD (P ⬍

PSP and AD (P ⬍ 0.001), but not between AD and agematched controls (P ⬎ 0.05) and PD and PSP (P ⬎ 0.05).
When the analysis was extended to compare TH OD in
cells with or without intracellular pathology (Fig. 11F–H),
the ﬁndings were similar to those seen with Nurr1. For
the most part NM-containing neurons with deﬁned
␣-synuclein-ir inclusions were TH-ir negative, and the NM
neurons with diffuse ␣-synuclein-ir inclusions had a low

DISCUSSION
Our study is the ﬁrst to examine alterations of Nurr1 in
PD and related disorders such as PSP, and AD. The major
ﬁndings of this study are: 1) Nurr1 immunoﬂuorescence
intensity was only decreased in nigral neurons with
␣-synuclein-ir inclusions and was normal in nigral neurons without inclusions in PD; 2) downregulation of Nurr1
expression was observed in SN neurons but not in the
hippocampal neurons in patients with PD, illustrating a
regional speciﬁcity for this change; 3) decrease in nigral
Nurr1 immunoﬂuorescence was not speciﬁc for PD but
was observed in other neurodegenerative diseases such as
PSP and AD; 4) decrease in Nurr1 in PSP was observed in
nigral neurons independent of whether they expressed
NFT; 5) Nurr1 was decreased in AD only in nigral neurons
expressing NFT; and 6) reduction in Nurr1 was associated
with reduction in TH.

(A1,B1,C1) and PHF-1 (A2,B2,C2) immunoﬂuorescence and the colocalization of TH and PHF-1 (merged pictures; A3,B3,C3). Note that
the TH immunoﬂuorescence intensity was severely diminished in the

neurons with PHF-1-ir NFT (arrows) but not in the neurons without
PHF-1-ir NFT (double arrows) in progressive supranuclear palsy and
Alzheimer’s disease cases. In contrast, the PHF-1 NFT in SN was not
observed in age-matched control cases. Scale bar ⫽ 80 ␮m in C3
(applies to A1–C3).

This dramatic loss of Nurr1 immunoreactivity within
the remaining NM neurons in PD is speciﬁc for the SN. No
difference in Nurr1-ir neuronal number or Nurr1 immunoﬂuorescence intensity was seen within the hippocampus of PD cases and age-matched controls. It is unclear
whether the decreased Nurr1 expression is merely a consequence of losing DA neuronal phenotype or is involved
in the pathogenesis of the disease. To investigate this
question further, we examined the brains of clinically and
pathologically diagnosed PSP cases to determine whether
reduction in Nurr1 also occurs in this related-disease.
There was a severe reduction of the Nurr1-ir neuronal
number and the OD of Nurr1 immunoﬂuorescence intensity in the NM neurons in PSP. Therefore, the decline of
Nurr1 expression is not speciﬁc for PD but is associated
with the loss of DA neuronal phenotype and is present in
other neurodegenerative diseases involving the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system.

The role of Nurr1 deﬁciency in the loss of the
dopaminergic neuronal phenotype is supported by the
ﬁnding that NM neurons, which are still present in
the SN of brains of patients with PD and PSP, have
lost their DA phenotype and have become Nurr1-ir
negative. Additional evidence supporting the role of
Nurr1 deﬁciency in DA neuronal degeneration is that
Nurr1 immunoﬂuorescence intensity is remarkably decreased in the neurons with ␣-synuclein-ir inclusions or
PHF-1-ir NFTs but not in the neurons lacking these
lesions. These ﬁndings suggest that the loss of Nurr1
expression is not only related to the loss of the DA
phenotype but also to a disease-related cellular attack
during the evolution of the disease process, as deﬁned
by the presence of ␣-synuclein-ir inclusions or NFTs.
Reduced Nurr1 expression may predispose DA neurons
toward a cascade of events ultimately leading to their
demise.

Multiple lines of evidence indicate that several genes
involved in the synthesis, axonal transport, storage, release, or reuptake of DA are regulated by Nurr1. These

genes include TH, vesicle membrane-associated transport
2 (VMAT2), DAT, and Ret (Zetterstrom et al., 1997;
Saucedo-Cardenas et al., 1998; Castillo et al., 1998). Neonatal Nurr1 knockout mice lack expression of neuronal
DAT, VMAT2, TH, and Ret (Sacchetti et al., 2001; Wallen
et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2003; Castillo et al., 1998; Simon et
al., 2003; Eells, 2003). These data support the hypothesis
that Nurr1 expression is important in maintaining the DA
phenotype in the fetus and that age-related decreases of
Nurr1 in humans is accompanied by a decline in TH (Chu
et al., 2002). Moreover, newborn Nurr1-deﬁcient (⫺/⫹)
mice show a signiﬁcant reduction in TH activity and expression relative to normal (⫹/⫹) mice (Eells et al., 2002).
Nurr1-deﬁcient (⫺/⫹) adult animals treated with MPTP
are more susceptible to the effects of the neurotoxin than
normal (⫹/⫹) mice (Le et al., 1999). The present data
demonstrated that the OD of Nurr1 immunoﬂuorescence
was signiﬁcantly decreased in nigral neurons that contained ␣-synuclein inclusions in PD and NFTs in PSP and
AD. The identiﬁcation of Nurr1 as a developmentally important trophic protein raises the possibility that differ-

Further analyses showed that the OD of Nurr1 and TH immunoﬂuorescence intensity was signiﬁcantly reduced in the neurons with
␣-synuclein-ir (␣-Syn) inclusions or paired helical ﬁlament-1 (PHF1)-ir NFTs but not in the neurons without ␣-synuclein-ir inclusions or
PHF-1-ir NFTs in Parkinson’s disease (B,F) and Alzheimer’s disease
(D,H), respectively. In contrast to Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, the OD of Nurr1 and TH immunoﬂuorescence intensity
in progressive supranuclear palsy (C,G) was signiﬁcantly decreased in
the neurons with or without PHF-1-ir NFTs (**, P ⬍ 0.05; ***, P ⬍

ences in the amount of Nurr1 expression may be important in predisposing nigral neurons to an earlier than
normal death during aging and disease.
A growing body of evidence has implicated ␣-synuclein
in the pathogenesis of PD (Eells, 2003; Dawson and Dawson 2003; Goldberg and Lansbury, 2000). Major support
for this hypothesis was derived from the discovery that
␣-synuclein is identiﬁed as a major component of Lewy
bodies and dystrophic neurites, i.e., the pathological hallmarks of both sporadic and familial PD (Masliah et al.,
2000; Michotte, 2003; Constantino and Honig, 2001). The
present study revealed that the NM neurons with
␣-synuclein-ir inclusions have reduced Nurr1 expression
in PD. This ﬁnding suggests a possible interaction between Nurr1 and ␣-synuclein. Although there is no direct

evidence linking Nurr1 and ␣-synuclein genes, Baptista
and coworkers (2003), demonstrated that ␣-synuclein coordinates the transcriptional regulation of dopamine synthesis genes, including the gene for Nurr1, in a human
neuroblastoma cell line. These data support the hypothesis that such gene-gene interaction may exist between
␣-synuclein and Nurr1 in the mammalian brain. Our data
illustrating that Nurr1 immunoreactivity downregulation
is more pronounced in PD compared with age-matched
controls and is more pronounced within nigral neurons
containing ␣-synuclein inclusions, whereas normal levels
are found in neurons lacking this pathology, further support this view.
It has been reported that downregulation of Nurr1 affects the synthesis of VMAT2 and DAT (Hermanson et al.,

NURR1 IN PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON’S DISEASE

513

2003). VMAT2 and DAT deﬁciency may affect the equilibrium of biochemical molecules within DA neurons so that
␣-synuclein could tend to form protoﬁbrils and accumulate
in the cell body (Vernier et al., 2004). Ret is the target gene
of Nurr1 and is one of the important receptors for glial cell
line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). GDNF, which
signals via Ret and an associated coreceptor, has recently
been implicated in maintaining the continuing health and
viability of DA neurons (Kordower et al., 2000). An intriguing explanation for DA degeneration might be that
downregulation of Nurr1 expression affects neuroprotective regulatory mechanisms, possibly inﬂuenced by GDNF
or other factors stimulating Ret signal transduction. Another possibility is that downregulation of Nurr1 expression induces upregulation of other genes, such as
Engrailed-1 and Engrailed-2, which mediate ␣-synuclein
expression (Simon et al., 2003). Additional studies are
needed to conﬁrm these hypotheses.
In conclusion, the present study indicates that a decrease in Nurr1 immunoreactivity is one of the signiﬁcant
events in the loss of the dopaminergic neuronal phenotype. Nurr1 expression is compromised the most in the
cells containing ␣-synuclein inclusions and NFTs in the
SN of patients with synucleopathies and tauopathies, respectively. The decline in Nurr1-ir expression is highly
correlated with loss of TH immunoﬂuorescence. We have
to acknowledge that, due to limitations in neuropathological studies per se, it is impossible to determine deﬁnitely
whether the correlation we observe is the cause or the
effect of the neuronal degeneration. Future studies should
focus on the correlation of Nurr1 deﬁciency with DAT,
VMAT2, and Ret deﬁciencies, to elucidate further the
sequence of events leading to the loss of phenotype and
eventual death of DA neurons in humans with PD. The
identiﬁcation of factors upregulating Nurr1 activity may
provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the DA deﬁciency
associated with a variety of neurologic disorders.
