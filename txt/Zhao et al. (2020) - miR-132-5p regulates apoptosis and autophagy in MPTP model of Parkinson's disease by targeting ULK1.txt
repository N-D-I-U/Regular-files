Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder
that is characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in
the substantia nigra of the brain. Numerous investigations
have focused on the underlying mechanism involved in the
progression of PD in recent decades. miR-132 is abnormal
expression in many diseases including PD. However, the
functional role and molecular mechanism of miR-132-5p
in PD pathogenesis are still not elucidated. In our study,
we found miR-132-5p was upregulated in 1-methyl-4pheny-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of PD. MTT
assay and flow cytometric analysis revealed that inhibition
of miR-132-5p increased cell survival ability and reduced
MPTP-induced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore,
inhibition of miR-132-5p could significantly suppressed
mRNA and protein expression levels of LC3 and Beclin
1, indicating inhibition of miR-132-5p might restrain
autophagy in PD. Subsequently, ULK1 was identified as a
target of miR-132-5p and positively regulated by miR132-5p at both mRNA and protein levels. Additionally,
ectopic expression of ULK1 was able to reverse the

Introduction

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder
and one of its main character is the progressive loss of
dopamine neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) [1]. Previous evidences of PD research have
shown that the pathophysiological mechanism of dopamine cell loss is related to protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxygenation stress, which may lead
to neuron apoptosis or impaired autophagy. Thus, strategies to reduce dopamine cell loss might provide effective treatment for PD patients. It is well known that the
interaction between genetic and environmental factors is
crucial to PD. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a contaminator of mitochondrial functions,
is often used to establish PD model [2].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous short noncoding
RNAs, which play a vital role in the post-transcriptional
regulation of target gene expression by interacting with
the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) of target mRNA
[3]. More and more evidences have demonstrated that
miRNAs play important roles in diseases of neurodegeneration or dopamine neuron biology. For example,
overexpression of miR-7 and miR-153 downregulate the
level of α-synuclein [4]. miR-124 decreased the apoptosis
and autophagy through inhibiting Bim in MPTP treated
mice model and MPTP-intoxicated SH-SY5Y model [5].

effects of miR-132-5p inhibition. Taken together, our
results demonstrated that miR-132-5p inhibition might
exert a protective role in MPTP-treated PD models by
targeting ULK1, indicating that miR-132-5p may be a
prospective therapeutic target for PD. NeuroReport 31:

In addition, miR-34b/c was downregulated in PD and
depletion of miR-34b or miR-34c reduced the viability of
SH-SY5Y cells [6].
miR-132, a brain-enriched miRNA, is upregulated in
PD. Convincing evidence has demonstrated miR-132
was increased in a transgenic model of PD, along with a
downregulating on the nuclear receptor-related 1 protein
(Nurr1) [7,8]. It is also reported that miR-132 was upregulated in the striatum of parkinsonian rats [9]. In view of the
evidence cited above, we hypothesized that miR-132-5p
might play a vital role in the pathology of DA neurons in
PD. In our research, we identified miR-132-5p was upregulated in MPTP-treated SH-SY5Y cells and SNpc of
MPTP-treated mice. Functional analysis of miR-132-5p
demonstrated that inhibition of miR-132-5p reduces
apoptosis and suppressed autophagy. Furthermore, we
identified a novel target of miR-132-5p – ULK1.

For studying the role of antago-miR-132-5p (RiboBio,
Guangzhou, China) in animal model, a catheter (RWD,
Shenzhen, China) was implanted into the stereotactic
intraventricular injection site (2 mm rostral to the bregma,
2 mm lateral to the sagittal suture, and 3 mm below the
skull surface). After 7 days of recovery, mice were treated
with antago-miR-132-5p through the catheter per day for
five consecutive days. As negative control (NC), antago-miR-NC was injected into the right lateral ventricle.
The treatment of antagomir was performed 2 days before
injection of MPTP. Then, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with saline or MPTP for five consecutive
days (30 mg/kg; Solarbio, Beijing, China). After the last
injection of MPTP, the mice were killed. The mice were
decapitated and once the brain was removed, the ventral
midbrain containing SNpc was dissected and stored at
−80°C for further experiments.
Cell lines, transfection, and RNA extraction

The SH-SY5Y cells were cultured at 37°C and CO2 in
RPMI 1640 media (Gibco, Gaitherburg, Maryland, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml
penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. miR-132-5p antisense oligonucleotides (ASO-miR-132-5p) was purchased from Gene
Pharma (Shanghai, China). A mirVana miRNA Isolation
Kit (Ambion, Austin, Texas, USA) was used to obtain
miRNAs from SH-SY5Y cells or midbrain according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations. TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) was used to extract total RNA.
Plasmid constructions

The gene encoding ULK1 was amplified from cDNA
isolated from SH-SY5Y cells with the primer sequences
sense 5′-GCG GAAT TCGA GCC GGCCGC
GGCGGCAC-3′, antisense 5′-GGCTA TCT AGA
ACTGACCGTA GACACG G-3′. The product was
~3150 bp, and it was cloned into pcDNA3 vector sites
(EcoR I and Xba I). The 3′-UTR (containing the binding sites for miR-132-5p) and a mutant 3′-UTR (seven
nucleotides were mutated in the binding sites) of ULK1
were annealed and cloned into pcDNA3-EGFP control vector sites (BamH I and Xba I). The ULK1-UTR
sense primer: 5′-GATC CGTGT GTGGTCCCTAT

Real-time reverse transcription PCR

Gene expression of mRNAs or miRNAs were quantified by SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Dalian, China)

using specific primers. The primers were designed using
Primer 5 software and are as follows: ULK1 forward
5′-AAGGGAA GTGCCAGTGAGG-3′, and reverse
5′-TGTCTGC CTGGTCCGTGA-3′; Beclin 1 forward 5′-CTGGACAC GAGTT TCAA GATCCTG-3′,
and reverse 5′-GGGC ATGGTAGCA CAGACCTC-3′;
LC3 forward 5′-GGAAGAATGACAGATGAC-3′, and
reverse 5′-CTTTCAAT CTGTT GGCTG-3′; β-actin
forward 5′-CGTG ACATTAA GGAGAAGCTG-3′, and
reverse 5′-CTA GAAGCA TTTG CGGTG GAC-3′. The
housekeeping gene β-actin (for mRNA) or RNU6B (for
miRNA) was measured as an internal control. Relative
expression of each gene was determined by 2−ΔΔCt
method.
MTT assay

Cells were plated in a 96-well plate at 8000 cells/well
after transfection. Cells were cultivated and 15 μl MTT
(at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml) was added into
each well for 4 h. Then, the medium was removed, and
the precipitated formazan (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
Missouri, USA) was dissolved in 100 μl DMSO for 20
minutes. Absorbance at 570 nm (A570) was measured by
a μQuant Universal Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, Vermont, USA).
Apoptosis assay

Transfected cells were washed three times in PBS, spun
at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes, and resuspended in 500 μl
Buffer. Then, the apoptotic of cells was evaluated by
Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Each
sample was incubated with 5 μl of Annexin-V-FITC and
10 μl of PI for 15 minutes at 25°C. Finally, the cells were
detected via flow cytometry.
EGFP reporter assay

A fluorescent reporter plasmid and ASO-miR-132-5p,
or their control oligonucleotides, together with
pDsRed2-N1 (an RFP expression vector plasmid, used
as the loading control) were transiently co-transfected
into SH-SY5Y cells in 48-well plates. The cells were
lysed using radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA)
lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.2, 1%
Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) after transfection for 48 h.
Then, the EGFP and RFP intensities were measured
via an F4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi,
Tokyo, Japan).
Western blot analysis

After transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS
three times. Then, total protein was extracted using RIPA
lysis buffer for 30 minutes at 4°C. Protein electrophoresis was performed in 8% or 20% SDS denaturing PAGE
gels and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore,
Billerica, Massachusetts, USA). The membrane was
incubated with primary antibodies against ULK1 antibody (1:300; Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China), LC3 and

Beclin 1 (1:500; Sangon Biotech), followed by incubation
with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Sangon
Biotech). GAPDH (1:1000; Sangon Biotech) was used as
a loading control.
Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance
with Dunnett’s post-test or two-way analysis of variance
with Bonferroni post-tests. All data were processed using
GraphPad Prism 7 software and statistical significance
was assessed by comparing mean values (±SD) from
three independent experiments. P < 0.05 was considered
to be significant.

Results
miR-132-5p expression is upregulated in MPTP-treated
SH-SY5Y cells and SNpc of MPTP-treated mice

To investigate the expression of miR-132-5p in MPTPtreated models, the expression of miR-132-5p was
analyzed using real-time PCR. The results indicated
the expression levels of miR-132-5p in SH-SY5Y cells
increased in a dose-dependent manner with the increase
of MPTP concentrations (Fig. 1a). Similarly, MPTP
induced significant increase of miR-132-5p in SNpc of
MPTP-treated mice compared with the control (Fig. 1b).
These results suggested that miR-132-5p may be upregulated in dopamine neurons during the pathogenesis
of PD.
Inhibition of miR-132-5p reduces MPTP-induced
apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells

In order to investigate the role of miR-132-5p in MPTPinduced PD model in vitro, SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with miR-132-5p antisense oligonucleotides
(ASO-miR-132-5p) or ASO control (ASO-NC). First, we

validated the efficiency of ASO-miR-132-5p by real-time
PCR. The results showed that the expression of miR132-5p in SH-SY5Y cells was significantly decreased
following transfection with ASO-miR-132-5p compared
with the control group, indicating that ASO-miR-132-5p
was effective in MPTP treated SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 2a).
Second, we used MTT assay to assess cell viability. The
results showed that inhibition of miR-132-5p reversed
MPTP-induced cell apoptosis (Fig. 2b). In addition, flow
cytometric analysis also revealed that the apoptosis rate
of SH-SY5Y cells treated with MPTP increased significantly, whereas inhibition of miR-132-5p could suppress
MPTP-induced cell apoptosis (Fig. 2c). Taken together,
these results suggested that miR-132-5p inhibition
exerted a protective role in MPTP-induced apoptosis of
SH-SY5Y cells.
Inhibition of miR-132-5p suppresses autophagy in
MPTP-treated SH-SY5Y cells and SNpc of MPTPtreated mice

To explore the role of miR-132-5p on autophagy in
MPTP-treated SH-SY5Y cells and SNpc of MPTPtreated mice, the expression level of autophagy protein
markers (LC3I, LC3II and Beclin 1) were detected by
real-time PCR or Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2d
and 2e, the mRNA expression levels of LC3II/ LC3I
ratio and Beclin 1 were upregulated in MPTP-treated
SH-SY5Y cells. Meanwhile, inhibition of miR-132-5p
could significantly suppress the MPTP-induced upregulation in mRNA expression levels of these autophagy
protein markers. Western blot analysis showed the similar
results (Fig. 2f). Consistent with the vitro experiments,
inhibition of miR-132-5p can also restrain the transformation of LC3I to LC3II and the protein expression of
Beclin 1 in SNpc of MPTP-treated mice compared with

three independent experiments. miR-132-5p level was normalized to U6 (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). SNpc, substantia nigra pars compacta.

ULK1 is a target of miR-132-5p

To investigate the underlying mechanism of miR-132-5p
in PD, we used programs (TargetScan, Pic Tar and miRbase Targets) to predict the potential target genes of
miR-132-5p. We chose ULK1 as a putative target with
two conserved miR-132-5p binding sites in its 3′-UTR,
because it is involved in apoptosis and autophagy, which
were consistent with the effects of miR-132-5p on the
phenotypes of MPTP-treated SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 3a).

First, pcDNA3/EGFP-ULK1-3′UTR or pcDNA3/
EGFP-ULK1-3′UTR-mut was co-transfected with ASOmiR-132-5p or ASO-NC into SH-SY5Y cells. As shown
in Fig. 3b, the fluorescence intensity of cells co-transfected with ASO-miR-132-5p and pcDNA3/EGFPULK1-3′UTR decreased by 50% (Fig. 3b). However,
inhibition of miR-132-5p had no significant effect on the
fluorescence intensity of cells transfected with pcDNA3/
EGFP-ULK1-3′UTR-mut. Next, to verify the regulatory role of miR-132-5p in endogenous ULK1 expression, real-time PCR and western blot were conducted to
examine the effects of miR-132-5p on ULK1 mRNA and
protein levels. The results showed that when inhibition

ULK1 is a target of miR-132-5p. (a) Complementary sequences of miR-132-5p to the ULK1 mRNA 3’UTR were obtained using publicly available
algorithms. (b) An EGFP reporter assay was performed to confirm direct regulation by miR-132-5p at 3’UTR of ULK1(*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). (c
and d) Real-time PCR and western blot were performed to detect the ULK1 mRNA and protein levels in SH-SY5Y cells transfected with ASOmiR-132-5p or ASO-NC. The control was normalized to 1. All experiments were performed three replicates with three wells per replicate. The bars

of miR-132-5p, ULK1 expression was reduced on both
mRNA and protein levels, as compared to the control
(Fig. 3c and d). Taken together, these results suggested
that ULK1 was a direct target gene of miR-132-5p and
that inhibition of miR-132-5p could down-regulate the
expression of ULK1, indicating that ULK1 was regulated
positively by miR-132-5p.
Overexpression of ULK1 restores the influence of ASOmiR-132-5p on MPTP-treated SH-SY5Y cells apoptosis
and autophagy

To investigate whether the phenotype of miR-132-5p
was mediated by ULK1 rather than by other genes, we
performed rescue experiments. First, we constructed an
overexpression vector (pcDNA3/ULK1) lacking the 3′UTR. The results of Western blot confirmed the expression of ULK1 in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 4a). Then, MTT
and flow cytometry results showed that overexpression of
ULK1 decreased the viability of cells and increased the
apoptosis rate. Notably, the ectopic expression of ULK1
reversed the effects of ASO-miR-132-5p on cell apoptosis (Fig. 4b and c). Western blot showed overexpression
of ULK1 could significantly increase the expression levels of autophagy protein markers. Meanwhile, ectopic
expression of ULK1 could reverse the effects of ASOmiR-132-5p on autophagy (Fig. 4d). Thus, these results

suggested that ULK1 was involved in the regulation
of apoptosis and autophagy by miR-132-5p in MPTPtreated SH-SY5Y cells.

Discussion

It is well known that miRNAs are regulators of many
genes at the post-transcriptional level. Abnormal miRNA
expression is related to physiological and pathological
processes. Identification of aberrant miRNAs and their
targets is critical for understanding the progression of PD,
which may be aid in the development of new biomarkers
for diagnosis and new therapeutic targets.
Numerous reports have demonstrated miR-132 is involved
in physiological and pathological processes. In the nervous
system, miR-132 is significant for regulating neuronal differentiation, maturation and functioning, and widely participates in axon growth, neural migration ang plasticity
[10–12]. Thus, the alteration of miR-132 is associated with
many CNS diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease [13,14],
cerebral ischemic stroke [15–17] and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [18]. In our reports, we focused
on the role of miR-132-5p in MPTP-induced PD model.
Consistent with previous studies, the expression of miR132-5p was elevated both in MPTP-treated SH-SY5Y
cells and SNpc of MPTP-treated mice, indicating that

Overexpression of ULK1 restores the influence of ASO-miR-132-5p on MPTP-treated SH-SY5Y cells apoptosis and autophagy. (a) Western
blot was used to detect the efficiency of pcDNA3/ULK1. GAPDH was used as an internal control. (b and c) The MTT assay and flow cytometry
were used to measure cells viability or cellular apoptosis following transfection of pcDNA3/ULK1 or co-transfection with ASO-miR-132-5p (*P <

control. All experiments were performed three replicates with three wells per replicate. The bars represent the mean ± SD of three independent

miR-132-5p might play a role in PD. Next, we used MTT
assay and flow cytometric analysis found that inhibition
of miR-132-5p increased cell survival ability and reduced
apoptosis in MPTP-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, we
also observed inhibition of miR-132-5p suppressed autophagy by detecting the mRNA and protein expression levels of LC3I, LC3II and Beclin 1.
Identifying the targets regulated by miR-132-5p is important for clarifying our understanding of PD’s pathological
process. Based on this perspective, we used bioinformatics

to predict target genes and selected ULK1 as the candidate target gene. First, we used EGFP reporter assay to
confirm the interaction between miR-132-5p and ULK1,
revealing that ULK1 was a direct target of miR-132-5p
and positively regulated by miR-132-5p. Second, realtime PCR and western blotting assays further confirmed
inhibition of miR-132-5p suppressed endogenous ULK1
expression at both the mRNA and protein levels.

have shown autophagy and apoptosis are related in
function [19,20]. In neuroblastoma, inhibition of ULK1
significantly reduced cell growth and promoted apoptosis [21]. Meanwhile, overexpression of ULK1 prevented PC-12 cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis
by promoting cell autophagy [22]. However, another
research showed that ULK1 expression was increased
in the MPP+ treated MN9D cell and ULK1 knockdown
increased neuronal cell viability [23]. In our research,
we found overexpression of ULK1 could reverse the
inhibition effect of ASO-miR-132-5p on apoptosis and
autophagy, indicating miR-132-5p might play a role
through regulating ULK1.
Conclusion

We found miR-132-5p might play an important role in
PD. Inhibition of miR-132-5p could reduce apoptosis and suppress autophagy through targeting ULK1 in
MPTP-intoxicated PD model. On the basis of these,
our research provided a valuable clue for developing a
prospective therapeutic target for control of PD in the
future, although the detail mechanisms of miR-132-5p,
ULK1 and PD remained to be fully elucidated.
