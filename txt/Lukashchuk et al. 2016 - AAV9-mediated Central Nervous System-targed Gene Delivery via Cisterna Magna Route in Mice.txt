AAV9-mediated central nervous system–targeted gene delivery
via cisterna magna route in mice
Vera Lukashchuk1, Katherine E Lewis1, Ian Coldicott1, Andrew J Grierson1 and Mimoun Azzouz1,2

Current barriers to the use of adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) in clinical trials for treating neurological disorders are its
high expression in many off-target tissues such as liver and heart, and lack of cell specificity within the central nervous system
(CNS) when using ubiquitous promoters such as human cytomegalovirus (CMV) or chicken-β-actin hybrid (CAG). To enhance
targeting the transgene expression in CNS cells, self-complementary (sc) AAV9 vectors, scAAV9-GFP vectors carrying neuronal Hb9
and synapsin 1, and nonspecific CMV and CAG promoters were constructed. We demonstrate that synapsin 1 and Hb9 promoters
exclusively targeted neurons in vitro, although their strengths were up to 10-fold lower than that of CMV. In vivo analyses of mouse
tissue after scAAV9-GFP vector delivery via the cisterna magna revealed a significant advantage of synapsin 1 promoter over both
Hb9 variants in targeting neurons throughout the brain, since Hb9 promoters were driving gene expression mainly within the
motor-related areas of the brain stem. In summary, this study demonstrates that cisterna magna administration is a safe alternative
to intracranial or intracerebroventricular vector delivery route using scAAV9, and introduces a novel utility of the Hb9 promoter for
the targeted gene expression for both in vivo and in vitro applications.

INTRODUCTION
Gene therapy research relies on the use and optimization of safe
nonreplicating viral vectors. The choice of the viral vector depends
on the tropism of the virus and its ability to allow sustained therapeutic gene expression in the target cells. A key challenge to be
overcome when designing an efficient gene therapy approach for
treating neurodegenerative disorders is access to the central nervous system (CNS), which must be mediated by either crossing the
blood–brain barrier or by direct administration into the CNS. Adenoassociated virus of serotype 9 (AAV9) has become a preferred vector
for CNS delivery, due to its increased ability to cross the blood–brain
barrier compared to other AAV serotypes.1,2 Indeed, several studies
have demonstrated successful reversal of the disease phenotype
and prolonged survival in mouse models of spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis upon intravenous AAV9 delivery.3–5 However, complications from systemic delivery of AAV9 and
its expression in non-CNS tissues such as liver and heart are likely
barriers to their success in patient clinical trials.6–9 Delivery into the
cerebrospinal fluid via intracerebroventricular route provides some
protection against diffusion of the AAV9 vector to peripheral organs
and more efficiently targets neurons and glia.10 Similarly, cisterna
magna route of injection has been recently adopted as an alternative method for delivery into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which results
in wide-spread gene delivery throughout the CNS11–16; however, the
data regarding the therapeutic efficacy using this administration
route in mouse models is sparse. The findings reported here aim to

improve the therapeutic potential of the AAV vectors when targeting to the motor neurons and motor pathways within CNS.
We previously demonstrated that the delivery of scAAV9 expressing survival motor neuron (SMN, causative gene for spinal muscular atrophy) driven by human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter
into neonatal mice fully rescues early lethality in mice.5 Using selfcomplementary (sc) AAV9 ensures a faster rate of gene transcription onset due to the double-stranded conformation of the genome
unlike conventional recombinant AAVs.17 The CMV promoter is
known to drive high levels of gene expression across both CNS
and non-CNS tissues when used in AAV vectors, and is therefore
not necessarily an ideal promoter to use for restricted CNS transduction.10,18,19 Several neuronal promoter sequences, including
­synapsin 1, CamkII, MeCP2, and Hb9 have been previously used to
restrict gene expression to the spinal cord and brain using viral vectors.20–26 Efficient gene expression in the motor neurons of lumbar
spinal cord was achieved after intracerebroventricular injection of
mice using AAV9 driven by synapsin 1.10,20 Hb9 is a motor neuronspecific promoter whose activity has been well-established in the
developing and postnatal spinal cord.27,28 In addition to motor neurons, a subset of Hb9-positive spinal cord interneurons has also
been reported.29 Two short regulatory sequences within the distal
region of Hb9 promoter with a size of 313 and 125 base pairs have
been identified as sufficient for targeting gene expression exclusively to spinal cord in transgenic embryonic mice.30 While lentiviral
vectors expressing Hb9 enhancer-driven green fluorescent protein

(GFP) resulted in moderate gene transfer efficiencies after intraparenchymal injection directly into the ventral horn of the lumbar spinal cord,26 expression data from AAV vectors driven by Hb9 have not
been reported.
In the present study, we sought to assess the neuron-targeting
properties and transduction efficiencies of scAAV9-GFP vectors carrying the Hb9 promoter enhancer elements and synapsin 1 (SYN1)
promoter after delivery of the virus into neonatal mice via the cisterna magna by comparing them to the ubiquitous promoters
CMV and chicken-β-actin fused to CMV enhancer (CAG). Our results
demonstrate the first account on the use of promoters of varying strengths and specificities in scAAV9-mediated reporter GFP
expression after intra-CSF delivery via cisterna magna in mice. In
addition, they highlight the novel applicability of the promoter Hb9
in therapeutic gene transfer to areas of the brain stem.

RESULTS
Characterization of scAAV9-GFP vectors carrying neuronal
promoters in spinal cord neurons in vitro
One of the challenges associated with constructing a transgene
within scAAV genomes is their small cloning capacity. Despite this,
several studies have demonstrated efficient neuronal targeting
using a short ~400 bp SYN1 promoter sequence20,22,25 while Hb9
promoter enhancer elements30 have never previously been tested
in AAV delivery systems. In this study, we assessed the activities of
SYN1 and Hb9 hybrid promoters in a side-by-side comparison to
conventionally used CAG and CMV promoters, which are known
for their high-level ubiquitous expression properties. Five scAAV9GFP virus stocks carrying different promoter elements including
CMV, CAG, Hb9 enhancer composed of two minimal Hb9 promoter
sequences (Hb9e), Hb9 enhancer fused to CMV minimal promoter
(Hb9cmv) and SYN1 (Figure 1) were produced to high titers (up to
3 × 1013 vg/ml). Spinal cord cultures purified from embryonic day 13
(E13) mouse embryos, containing motor neurons and interneurons
as well as glia, were transduced on day in vitro 2 and analyzed after
7 days. Representative image fields of the transduced cells used
in quantification analyses are shown in Figure 2a. Promoter activities were determined by two principal measures: (i) the percentage of GFP-positive cells (transduction efficiency; Figure 2b) and
(ii) the fluorescence intensity of the GFP-positive cells (promoter
strength; Figure 2c). Cells transduced with CMV and CAG viral vectors resulted in the majority of the cells expressing GFP (97 and 82%,
respectively), while the transduction with the viral vectors encoding
neuronal promoter constructs Hb9cmv, SYN1, and Hb9e resulted in
a lower proportion of GFP-positive cells (59, 58, and 19%, respectively; Figure 2b). The Hb9e vector resulted in significantly lower
(P < 0.0001) transduction levels than those with other promoters.
Analysis of the GFP intensity signal in the transduced cells revealed
that despite similarities between CAG and CMV promoters in celltargeting efficiencies, CAG promoter strength was almost threefold
lower than that of CMV (Figure 2c). It was evident that in the case of
Hb9, the short CMV minimal promoter significantly enhanced gene
expression (P < 0.01). Interestingly, in this in vitro assay, SYN1 had
a comparably low strength to Hb9e construct (~50 intensity units;
Figure 2c), despite having achieved 58% average gene transfer efficiency as demonstrated in Figure 2b.

scAAV9-CMV and scAAV9-CAG transduction resulted in high transduction efficiency within both neurons and astrocytes, visualized
by staining with the pan-neuronal marker MAP2 and the astrocytic
marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), respectively (Figure 3a–d).
Consistent with their neuronal origin, SYN1, Hb9cmv and Hb9e promoters were driving strictly neuronal gene expression (Figure 3e–j),
as determined by distinctive neuronal morphology and a lack of
double-GFP/GFAP-positive cells. Surprisingly, transduction with
Hb9cmv vector did not result in GFP expression in GFAP-positive or
MAP2-negative cells, despite the presence of the CMV minimal promoter normally associated with ubiquitous expression (Figure 3g–h).
Immunostaining for motor neuron marker Islet-1 (Supplementary
Figure S1) revealed that motor neurons were efficiently targeted by
all promoter constructs, suggesting the utility of these vectors in in
vitro applications when neuronal tropism is required.

genomes of five titer-matched scAAV9-GFP vectors harboring CMV,
CAG, SYN1, Hb9cmv, and Hb9e promoter sequences. CNS tissue
was paraformadehyde (PFA)-perfused and harvested for immunohistochemistry analyses at 3 weeks postinjection. Immunostaining

of the spinal cord sections with anti-NeuN antibody has demonstrated efficient CNS-targeting capacities of CMV, CAG, and SYN1
but not Hb9cmv or Hb9e promoters when used at the same dose
(Supplementary Figure S2; Figure 4). In the spinal cord, scAAV9-CMVGFP transduction resulted in the highest GFP-positive cell numbers
and most intense fluorescence levels in both the lumbar and cervical regions (Figure 4a,i), while CAG and SYN1 were noticeably weaker
promoters (Figure 4c,e—lumbar cord; k,m—cervical cord). Moreover,
unlike CMV (Figure 4b,j), SYN1 targeted CGRP-positive motor neurons within the lumbar spinal cord with lower efficiency (Figure 4f,h).
Surprisingly, none of the ventral horn neurons of the animals treated
with scAAV9-Hb9cmv and scAAV9-Hb9e expressed GFP (data not
shown), although several GFP-positive interneurons (up to 10 per
area) were detected within the dorsal horns of the lumbar spinal cord
(Figure 4g).
Quantification of the GFP-positive cells in each region, from
three spinal cord sections located approximately 250–300 µm apart
(Figure 4o), revealed that indeed CMV promoter-driven expression
resulted in significantly higher (P < 0.0001) relative GFP-positive
numbers of cells within cervical spinal cord, but not within lumbar spinal cord, when compared to CAG and SYN1. Analysis of the
CGRP-positive motor neurons within the cervical and lumbar spinal cord (Figure 4p) determined a transduction efficiency of about
80% for motor neurons in CMV-treated animals. Transduction with
both scAAV9-CAG and scAAV9-SYN1 across the spinal cord resulted
in a significantly lower proportions of GFP-positive/CGRP-positive
motor neurons than with CMV. These findings demonstrate that the
CMV promoter has a distinct advantage for spinal cord gene transfer, particularly to motor neurons, over both SYN1 and CAG promoters when the vectors are delivered intracisternally.

Cisterna magna delivery of scAAV9 virus allows efficient
transduction throughout the mouse brain
Determining the areas of the brain targeted by various promoters
can identify therapeutically relevant promoters for gene delivery
to treat neurological disorders. Here, we analyzed four principal
areas of the brain after transduction with CMV, CAG, SYN1, Hb9cmv,
and Hb9e promoter-bearing scAAV9-GFP viral vectors delivered
through cisterna magna: cerebellum, motor cortex, motor-related
areas of the brain stem, and hippocampus (Figure 5; Supplementary
Figure S3). Merged-view representative images of the brain sections
immunostained with anti-NeuN and anti-GFP antibodies provided
qualitative information about the overall distribution and the levels of transgene expression. As expected, CMV and CAG were
very efficient at targeting gene expression throughout the brain.
SYN1 showed a uniform distribution of the GFP-positive neurons
throughout the brain (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S3).
Interestingly, Hb9cmv and Hb9e promoter constructs were driving
GFP expression in the brain stem, with majority of the GFP-positive
cells detected around the motor and sensory areas of the midbrain
(Figure 5b). Upon a closer inspection, the areas positive for GFP in
Hb9cmv-treated animals were identified as motor-related areas of
pons such as tegmental reticular nucleus and midbrain reticular
nucleus. We also observed high frequency of GFP-positive cells in
sensory areas of midbrain including superior and inferior colliculi.
Unlike Hb9cmv, Hb9e did not mediate expression in the sensory
areas, but still showed expression predominantly within the periaqueductal gray and tegmental areas, as seen in the ­low-magnification
image in the Supplementary Figure S3. All promoters except Hb9e
were capable of driving GFP expression within the cerebellum, predominantly within the Purkinje cell layer (Figure 5a). Purkinje cells

Figure 3 scAAV9-GFP carrying neuronal promoters transduce spinal cord neurons in vitro. Mixed spinal cord culture was established from E13 mouse

were identified by a distinct branched morphology, with their cell
bodies located at the edge of granular cell layer. Hippocampus (particularly neurons of the polymorph layer within the dentate gyrus)
and cerebral cortices were efficiently transduced with scAAV9 vectors carrying CMV, CAG, and SYN1 promoters, but were less efficiently transduced by Hb9cmv and Hb9e (Figure 5c,d); however,
several detected GFP-positive cells suggested these Hb9 promoter
constructs may have gene expression capabilities in these areas
when delivered at higher doses.
Quantification of the GFP-positive cells within the chosen brain
regions revealed similarities between the targeting properties of
CMV, CAG, and SYN1 promoters across all four areas (Figure 5e–h).
Hb9cmv and Hb9e promoters were significantly less efficient in
transduction across cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, when
normalized and compared to CMV. However, their transduction
efficiencies within the brain stem (motor-related areas of midbrain; Figure 5g) were similar to those observed in the CMV-treated
animals.

In order to account for the cell-type differences between the two
conventionally-used promoters CMV and CAG, proportions of glial
cells positive for GFP were determined, as a percentages of the total
GFP-positive cell numbers represented (Supplementary Figure S4).
Interestingly, we noticed that the number of transduced glia
increased with the further location of the CNS areas from the injection site, with the highest proportions of GFP-positive cells located
within lumbar cord region in animals injected with CMV or CAG vectors. GFP-positive glial cells were detected within the midbrain of
Hb9cmv and Hb9e treated animals (Figure 5b, yellow arrow) and
equaled 2.2 and 7.5%, respectively, and 8% within the motor cortex
of Hb9cmv-treated animals, but were not included in the analysis
presented in Supplementary Figure S4.
In summary, our study demonstrated that CMV, CAG and SYN1
have a significant advantage over Hb9cmv and Hb9e promoter activities when used in scAAV9-GFP vector system for transducing CNS in
all of the regions tested, apart from the brain stem. Importantly, we
have identified selective specificity of Hb9 enhancer for the brain

Figure 4 Intracerebrospinal fluid delivery via cisterna magna of scAAV9-GFP results in differential gene delivery efficiencies in the mouse spinal cord
depending on the use of the promoter. Wild-type mice at postnatal day 1 were injected with different scAAV9 viral vectors at equal doses of 1 × 1010
vg/g and sacrificed after 21 days post-transduction. Lumbar spinal cord (a–h) and cervical spinal cord (i–n) 25 μm sections were immunostained

Figure 5 GFP expression in the brain following cisterna magna delivery of scAAV9-GFP vectors with different promoters. 40-µm brain sections of
3-week-old transduced and PFA-perfused mice were immunostained with anti-GFP and anti-NeuN antibodies (b–d), or with anti-GFP antibodies
alone (a) for NeuN-negative Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum (Hb9e treatment shown with anti-GFP antibody staining only, to avoid masking the
weak GFP signal). Representative images were captured on the sections of cerebellum (a), brain stem (midbrain, motor-related; b), hippocampus
(dentate gyrus—polymorph layer; c), and motor cortex (d). Yellow arrow heads point to NeuN-negative glial cells used in quantification (determined
by morphology). Scale bar = 50 µm. Efficiency of transduction in the brain was determined by counting GFP-positive cells in 1 mm2 area of each brain
section and normalizing the resulting numbers to the average number of CMV treatment for each brain region (e—cortex; f—hippocampus; g—brain
stem; h—cerebellum). The bar graphs represent relative mean ± SD. Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance with

stem region, particularly those areas involved in the motor control
pathways, when scAAV9-Hb9-GFP vectors were delivered via cisterna magna.
DISCUSSION
Previous reports have demonstrated the ability of scAAV9 vectors
to cross the blood–brain barrier when delivered intravenously.2,31
Direct administration of scAAV9 to the CSF, coupled with the use of
a specific promoter, can further target desired cell types within the
CNS and is of particular interest to neurodegeneration therapeutics,
where cell-specific expression of a transgene may be required. In
this study, we examined transduction efficiency of cisterna magnadelivered scAAV9 expressing GFP under the control of neuronspecific SYN1, Hb9 enhancer (Hb9e), or Hb9cmv fusion promoters,
and compared this to the ubiquitous CMV and CAG promoters. We
have achieved widespread gene delivery throughout the brain and
spinal cord by delivering scAAV9-GFP into cisterna magna of neonatal mice. We have demonstrated that the level of gene expression
was dependent on the choice of the promoter. The current study
revealed that Hb9 promoter regulatory sequences derived from
the promoter of a motor neuron-specific gene were able to target
expression to the areas of the brain stem, but not the spinal cord,
while SYN1 promoter offered a uniform neuron-specific transduction throughout the CNS. The latter finding was consistent with previous studies using alternative AAV delivery routes.10,20 Moreover,
we demonstrate the novel applicability of the short Hb9 promoter
elements for in vitro applications using AAV9 in primary neuron cultures for specific neuronal targeting, where moderate gene expression levels may be required.
Intracerebrospinal fluid delivery of AAV vectors via cisterna
magna is a relatively recently established route of delivery in gene
transfer studies, which has been gaining preference particularly in
preclinical studies using large animals.11–14 Major advantages of this
delivery route include: (i) substantially smaller quantity of the vector required compared to systemic delivery of AAV vectors, which
directly impacts standard laboratory production of multiple vector
constructs and large-scale clinical-grade production of the virus;
and (ii) reduction of viral particles reaching peripheral organs such
as liver.13,16 Recently published evidence suggests that AAV9, but
not AAV1 or -5, expressing GFP under the control of the CMV promoter and delivered via cisterna magna leads to the most abundant
transduction within the cervical and lumbar spinal cord regions of
mice.11 Consistent with these previous findings, here we observed
efficient gene transfer in the brain and spinal cord of young mice,
covering cerebellum, brain stem, hippocampus, and cortices using
CMV, CAG, and SYN1 promoters. These data show that delivery of
scAAV9 into the cisterna magna of neonatal mice is an efficient
delivery route for widespread transduction of CNS regions.
Despite bypassing the blood–brain barrier, cisterna magna route
of delivery does not offer neuron-specific gene expression due
to the ability of AAV9 to infect a wide range of cells, an observation supported by our study and previous reports.11,15,16 Given the
implication of astrocytes in the pathology of neurodegenerative
diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, spinal muscular atrophy and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,32–35 the high level of non-neuronal cell
transduction with CMV and CAG promoters, demonstrated in this
study (Supplementary Figure S4), may be advantageous for those
disease models. However, when there is a risk of disseminated
expression of a protein with a potentially toxic function in off-target cell types and organs, neuron-specific promoters are preferred.
Hb9cmv and Hb9e promoters, in addition to the well-characterized
Official journal of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy

SYN1 promoter,10,20–22 may provide such utility for the AAV9mediated therapy targeting neurological diseases, as they confer
minimal non-neuronal gene expression when used with scAAV9
background.
Hb9 protein is a transcription factor whose functions have been
largely attributed to the spinal cord and, in particular, motor neurons.28 Hb9 protein is a known motor neuron marker for neurons
differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells36,37; however,
its role in the brain is not clearly defined. Our results provide novel
information regarding the activity of the distal enhancer elements
of Hb9 promoter within the brain stem of postnatal animals, suggesting that scAAV9-Hb9 could be a useful vector for directing gene
expression selectively to brain stem neurons. However, the virtual
lack of transduction by the Hb9 distal enhancer elements (Hb9e) at
other CNS sites suggests that this selectivity would be gained at the
expense of lower overall expression. While we cannot yet speculate
about the complete lack of activity of these Hb9 enhancers in adult
animals, given their weak expression in vitro (Figure 2), Hb9-driven
GFP expression in living mice may also be below detection thresholds due to the vector doses used in our studies. The presence of
GFP in the spinal cord driven by other promoters suggests that the
absence of transduction with the Hb9 promoters in the spinal cord
(Figure 4) was not due to inadequate delivery following cisterna
magna administration. Interestingly, Peviani et al.26, have previously
reported astrocytic and other non-neuronal cell targeting using
the same Hb9 enhancer sequences in the lentiviral vector platform
after intraparenchymal delivery directly to the lumbar spinal cord.
Similarly, we also observed some scattered non-neuronal cell targeting within the brain using both Hb9cmv and Hb9e promoters
in scAAV9 system, suggesting that this was not exclusively due to
the presence of the CMVmp sequence. A 1.6 kb pair distal promoter
region, comprising the two enhancers targeted exclusively neurons
when delivered via a lentiviral vector into the spinal cord.26 These
data would suggest that additional sequence elements within the
distal promoter may also contribute to neuronal specificity; however, due to the transgene packaging capacity limitation in scAAV
vectors, using larger promoter fragments would result in inefficient
gene transfer irrespective of the delivery route. Additional transcriptionally conserved regions within the proximal part of the Hb9 promoter have been identified27 but their applicability in gene therapy
vectorology is yet to be established. A more comprehensive analysis of Hb9 promoter activity and its expression in diseased neurons
may be required to be able to speculate whether therapeutic gene
delivery using Hb9 promoter would be appropriate for neurodegenerative conditions.
In summary, despite the cell-type specificity conferred by a neuronal promoter, gene therapy studies may need to take into account
the desired levels of therapeutic protein expression, the route of
delivery and the amount of virus being used. Several clinical trials
are currently focusing on the surgical delivery of the vectors for neurodegenerative disease, such as anti-Batten’s disease therapy using
intracranial routes for AAV2-CLN2 administration; whereas intravenous delivery is now being adopted as the route of administering AAV9-SMN vector for spinal muscular atrophy treatment in the
phase 1/2 trial, with the outcome of this study currently pending.38
Through the intracisternal route of delivery it is possible to achieve
a high level of therapeutic gene delivery throughout CNS without
highly invasive surgical intervention. In addition, cisterna magna
delivery offers an attractive advantage for viral vector administration due to substantial reduction of the disseminated gene
transfer to the peripheral organs and evasion of the host immune

response.13 Combining this approach with sufficient viral genomes
and targeted promoter constructs will achieve desired specificity tailored to a particular therapeutic gene target. In this way, our
study represents another step forward towards a targeted design of
a gene delivery strategy using AAV9 vectors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmid constructs
Plasmid scAAV-CMV-GFP was received from St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital (Memphis, TN). To construct the scAAV-GFP transgene plasmid vectors carrying different promoters (Figure 1), the promoter elements were
amplified as described below and depicted on Figure 1, using the primers
specified in Table 1, and cloned into scAAV-CMV-GFP cassette replacing
the original CMV promoter. To generate Hb9 enhancer (Hb9e) and Hb9cmv
hybrid promoter fused to CMV minimal promoter (mp), Hb9 regulatory elements of 313 and 120 bp long30 were amplified from pHb9-EGFP expression vector (Addgene plasmid 16275 (ref. 29); Addgene, Cambridge, MA)
containing the full Hb9 promoter sequence and cloned between restriction
sites as indicated in Figure 1a. Full CMV promoter and CMVmp were derived
from pAAV-MCS (Stratagene, Stockport, UK). Human synapsin 1 promoter
was amplified from pAAV-SYN1-RFP, a gift from Edward Callaway (Addgene
plasmid 22907).21 CAG promoter, composed of chicken β-actin promoter
and CMV enhancer, was amplified from pCAGGS plasmid obtained from the
Belgian Coordinated Collection of Microorganisms.39 Standard cloning procedures for DNA extraction and production of the large-scale plasmids were
followed using QIAGEN kits following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Large-scale production of scAAV9
Stocks of scAAV9-GFP were produced by transfecting human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells and purifying using iodixanol gradient purification method.
Briefly, HEK293T cells in 15 cm dishes were transfected with packaging plasmids pHelper (Stratagene; Stockport, UK), pAAV2/9 (kindly provided by
J.Wilson, University of Pennsylvania) and one of the transgene plasmids scAAVGFP at 2:1:1 ratio, respectively, using polyethylenimine (1 mg/ml) in serum-free
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. At 4 days post-transfection, supernatant
containing cell-released virus was harvested, treated with benzonase (10
unit/ml; Sigma, Poole, UK) for 2 hours at 37 °C and concentrated to equal to
approximately 24 ml using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal 100K Filters (Millipore,
Watford, UK). Iodixanol gradient containing 15, 25, 40, and 54% iodixanol solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/1 mmol/l MgCl2/2.5 mmol/l KCl and
virus solution was loaded and centrifuged at 69,000 revolutions per minute for
90 minutes at 18 °C. After ultracentifugation, the virus fractions were visualized
on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, stained using SYPRO Ruby (Life Technologies,

Table 1

Paisley, UK) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. The highest purity
fractions (identified by the presence of the three bands corresponding to VP1,
VP2, and VP3) were pooled and concentrated further in the final formulation
buffer consisting of PBS supplemented with an additional 35 mmol/l NaCl40
using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal 100K filters. Viral titers were determined by
quantitative PCR assays using primers directed against GFP and a linearized
scAAV-CMV-GFP vector as a standard curve.

In vitro AAV transduction of the embryonic mouse spinal cord
neurons
A pregnant female wild-type C57bl/6 mouse was sacrificed at 13 days of gestation (E13) using Schedule 1 method in accordance with Home Office UK
regulations. Embryos were removed, and the spinal cords were dissected out.
The cells were dissociated by trypsinization and trituration, pooled together
and plated onto 10 mm glass coverslips precoated with 50 µg/ml poly-Dornithine hydrobromide and 2.5 µg/ml laminin (Sigma, Poole, UK) at a density of 60,000 cells per coverslip. Cells were maintained in Neurobasal media
supplemented with 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mmol/l L-glutamine, 2%
horse serum, and 2% B27 supplement. 50% media was changed every 48
hours. Transduction with scAAV9-GFP vectors was carried out at 40–48 hours
after initial plating (2 days in vitro) by applying up to 5 × 109 vg per cell monolayer for 7 days before fixing in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were monitored
on a daily basis, as GFP fluorescence was developed.

Immunocytochemistry
Transduced or mock-treated cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS (PBS-Tx), blocked with 10% normal
goat serum (NGS) in PBS-Tx and then incubated with primary antibodies
in a single antibody staining assay against neuronal tubulin marker MAP2
(1:1,000; Sigma), motor neuron markers Islet-1 (1:1,000; Abcam, Cambridge,
UK) or astrocyte marker GFAP (1:1,000; Sigma) diluted in 2% NGS/PBS-Tx
overnight at 4 °C. The following day the cells were counter-stained with secondary Alexa-Fluor conjugated antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature,
and washed in PBS between the incubations. Finally, coverslips were stained
with Hoechst stain (1:2,000; Sigma) to visualize the nuclei and mounted
onto a slide using FluoroMount media (Sigma). The images were captured
on Leica confocal laser-scanning microscope using 63× oil lens and appropriate optical zoom, and processed using LAS AF Lite and ImageJ softwares.

Quantification of in vitro GFP fluorescence and statistical analysis
To quantify GFP-positive cells and intensity of GFP fluorescence, images were
captured on InCell imager (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK) using 20×
magnification. For determining transduction efficiencies using automated

InCell Developer Software (GE Healthcare) with a gray level range of
0-65535, up to 3,000 cells were counted. Background GFP fluorescence was
determined on cell-free area of each treatment or mock-treated cells, and
the GFP-positive cell numbers were normalized to above the background
values. In order to determine and compare GFP expression intensities for
each treatment, the gray values in the GFP-positive cells above the background were averaged. The collected data represent mean values based on
triplicate treatments. Statistical analysis of in vitro AAV transduction data was
performed by one-way analysis of variance in GraphPad Prism (version 6.05)
with each promoter representing a separate group. Multiple comparisons
between the means were done using Tukey’s multiple comparison test with
95% confidence interval.

In vivo scAAV9 transduction of wild-type neonatal mice
All experiments involving mice were conducted according to the Animal
(Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, under Project License 40/3739 and
approved by the University of Sheffield Ethical Review Sub-Committee, and
the UK Animal Procedures Committee (London, UK). The UK Home Office
code of practice for the housing and care of animals used in scientific procedures was followed according to Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
Animals were maintained in a controlled facility in a 12-hour dark/12-hour
light cycle, a standardized room temperature of 21 °C, with free access to
food and water.
For scAAV9 delivery into the CSF via cisterna magna, 15 wild-type C57BL/6
mice (n = 3 per group) at postnatal day 1 were anesthetized in an induction chamber using 5% isoflurane and oxygen at 3 l/minute before being
placed on a red transilluminator (Philips Healthcare “Wee Sight”—product
no. 1017920) with their head tilted slightly forward and nose attached to
an anesthetic supply. Anesthesia was maintained with 2% isoflurane and
oxygen at 0.3 l/minute. A 33-gauge needle attached to a Hamilton syringe
and peristaltic pump was lowered approximately 1 mm into the cisterna
magna area using stereotaxic apparatus at an angle of 45 degrees, and 1 µl
of viral solution (1 × 1010 vg/µl) was injected at a rate of 1 µl/minute. An equal
volume of PBS/35 mmol/l NaCl was used as a control solution. Three weeks
after virus injection, the animals were terminally anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of an overdose of sodium pentobarbital, and perfused
transcardially with PBS/heparin solution, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) in PBS. Brains and spinal cords were postfixed in 4% PFA overnight at
4 °C, and then subjected to two rounds of cryoprotection by incubating the
tissue in 30% sucrose/PBS solution for 24–48 hours at 4 °C.

Immunohistochemistry of CNS tissue
For immunohistochemistry analysis, the tissues were embedded in O.C.T.
embedding matrix, and 40-µm-thick brain sections and 25-µm-thick spinal
cord sections were cut on a cryostat at −22 °C free-floating or onto a slide,
respectively. Brain sections or spinal cord sections were washed twice with
PBS, permeabilized in PBS/0.3% Triton X-100, blocked with 10% NGS in
PBS/0.3% Triton X-100 solution for up to 3 hours, and incubated with primary
antibodies diluted in 2% NGS in PBS/0.15% Triton X-100 overnight. Primary
antibodies were a combination of rabbit anti-GFP (1:500; Life Technologies)
with either of the following mouse antibodies: anti-NeuN (1:300; Millipore,
Watford, UK) or anti-Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) (1:500; Sigma).
The following day, the sections were washed in PBS four times for up to 2 hours
and incubated with secondary antibodies Alexa-Fluor anti-mouse 568 or antirabbit 488 (Life Technologies) diluted in 5% NGS/PBS for 1 hour. For visualizing
nuclei, 1:2500 Hoechst stain (Sigma) in PBS was used. Images were captured
on Leica confocal microscope using 40× oil lens and optical zoom, and were
processed using LAS AF Lite software and ImageJ. Low-magnification images
of the spinal cord sections were captured on Leica confocal microscope using
10× dry lens and 488 nm wavelength (FITC channel) only. Low-magnification
images of the brain sections were captured using 2× and 4× lens on a Nikon
fluorescent microscope.

Quantification of in vivo gene transfer and statistical analysis
For quantification of GFP-positive cells in the ventral horns of lumbar and
cervical spinal cord sections, a Nikon fluorescent microscope with 20×
lens was used to capture an image of the ventral horn from three sections
(approximately 300 µm apart) of lumbar and cervical spinal cord per animal.
The sum of GFP-positive cells in the three ventral horns per animal was used
for analysis. The data was normalized to the CMV promoter in the cervical
group region. Statistical analysis on the spinal cord counts was performed

Official journal of the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy

by two-way analysis of variance using GraphPad prism, with region and
promoter as the two independent variables. For spinal cord data set, simple
effects of promoters (CMV, CAG, and SYN1 only) were compared within each
region (cervical or lumbar) using Tukey’s multiple comparisons test to a control group CMV.
For quantification of the brain sections, wide-field fluorescence images
were captured using a 10× lens. In each of the four chosen brain areas (cerebellum, hippocampal formation, midbrain, and motor cortex), one image
per region per animal (representing a region of 1 mm2) was captured and
used for counting. The numbers of GFP-positive cells were counted manually
with the assistance of ImageJ software (Cell Counter plug-in), by an observer
blinded to vector treatment. The cell counts were normalized to the average
of scAAV9-CMV-GFP-treated group for each brain region. Statistical analysis
for the brain counts was performed using one-way analysis of variance with
Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test to CMV control.
