Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since its initial characterization over 20 years ago, there has been intense and unwavering interest
in understanding the role of the transcription factor cAMP-responsive element binding protein
(CREB) in a nervous system physiology. Through an array of experimental approaches and model
systems, researchers have begun to unravel the complex and multifaceted role of this transcription
factor in such diverse processes as neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection.
Here we discuss current insights into the molecular mechanisms by which CREB couples synaptic
activity to long-term changes in neuronal plasticity, which is thought to underlie learning and
memory. We also discuss work showing that CREB is a critical component of the neuroprotective
transcriptional network, and data indicating that CREB dysregulation contributes to an array of
neuropathological conditions.

CREB structure and regulation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CREB was originally identified in 1987 as a 43kDa, nuclear protein which binds to the
cAMP response element (CRE) of the somatostatin gene in PC12 cells (Montminy &
Bilezikjian 1987). Further work revealed that CREB is a member of a large functionallyand structurally-related group of transcription factors, termed the basic leucine zipper
domain (b-zip domain) family, which includes activation transcription factor 1 (ATF1), and
cAMP responsive element modulator (CREM). Of note, a detailed discussion of the various
CREB splice variants, as well as other b-zip family members is beyond the scope of this
review, and as such, readers are referred to excellent reviews of this topic (Mayr &
Montminy 2001, Don & Stelzer 2002).
CREB can be organized into distinct domains that allow it to dimerize, interact with DNA,
cofactors, and the basal transcriptional complex. Located at the C-terminus of CREB is the
bZIP DNA-binding domain, which binds to the CRE, and the dimerization domain, which
allows CREB to homo- and hetero-dimerize (Schumacher et al. 2000). Located at the Nterminus of CREB is the glutamine rich 1 (Q1) domain, which is followed by the kinaseinducible domain (KID), and then the Q2 domain. These domains interact with various cofactors (described below) as well as components of the basic transcription complex
(Johannessen et al. 2004). For example, Q1 and Q2 domains interact with TATA binding
protein-associated factor II 135 (TAFII135) which in turn recruits a polymerase complex
and stimulates transcription (Felinski & Quinn 2001).

The KID is a regulatory region that plays a key role in coupling changes in intracellular
signaling to CREB-mediated transcription. Central to this region is Serine (Ser) 133, which
is targeted by a number of activity-inducible kinases, including Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinase
(CaMK) II and IV, protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), mitogen/stressactivated kinas (MSK), ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), AKT, and MAPKAP kinase2 (MK2)
(Gonzalez & Montminy 1989, de Groot et al. 1993, Sun et al. 1994, Ginty et al. 1994, Deak
et al. 1998, Xing et al. 1996, Du & Montminy 1998, Tan et al. 1996). Hence, kinase activity
in response to an array of stimuli, including increased intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP, triggers
the phosphorylation of Ser 133. Once in the Ser 133-phosphorylated state, CREB becomes a
binding target of the KIX domain in the transcription co-activators, CREB binding protein
(CBP) and p300 (Parker et al. 1996), thus allowing induction of CRE-mediated
transcription.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to Ser 133, the functionality of CREB can be affected via an array of additional
phosphorylation events, which have complex, and context-specific effects on CREB
transactivation. For example, the phosphorylation of Ser 142 by CaMKII has been shown to
represses CREB transactivation by triggering the dissociation of the CREB dimer and, in
turn, inhibiting CBP recruitment (Wu & McMurray 2001, Kornhauser et al. 2002).
Conversely, using a combination of phosphorylation-specific antibodies, and a CREB Ser
142-to-Alanine 142 knock-in mouse, Gau et al. (2002), showed Ser 142 is phosphorylated in
an activity-dependent manner and is required for robust CREB-mediated gene expression in
the CNS (Gau et al. 2002).
Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta (GSK3beta), a kinase implicated in neurodegenerative and
psychiatric disorders, phosphorylates CREB at Ser 129. As with Ser 142, the
phosphorylation of this site has been shown to both enhance and suppress CREB- mediated
gene expression (Fiol et al. 1994, Bullock & Habener 1998, Grimes & Jope 2001). Recent
work has also revealed that in response to the genotoxic stress, the homeodomain-interacting
protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) phosphorylates CREB at Ser 271 and activates CREB-dependent
gene transcription through the recruitment of CBP/p300 (Sakamoto et al.). Finally, the
complexity of CREB phospho-regulation can be appreciated by the work of Shanware et al.
(2007), which showed that DNA damage triggers CREB inhibition via a series of
intertwined steps initiated by casein kinase (CK) phosphorylation of multiple Ser residues
(i.e., Ser 108, 111, 114, and 117), which in turn, allows ataxia telangiectasia mutated
(ATM)-dependent phosphorylation on Ser 121, thus leading to a decoupling of CREB and
CBP. Given the discussion above, it should not be surprising that CK/ATM phosphorylation
has also been shown to stimulate rather than inhibit CREB transactivation (Kim et al., 2010).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to inducible phosphorylation, CREB dephosphorylation can also be regulated in
an activity-dependent manner. Along these lines, the dephosphorylation of CREB at Ser
133, which leads to transcriptional repression, is mediated by Ser /Thr-specific protein
phosphatases type 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) (Alberts et al. 1994, Wadzinski et al. 1993). Of
note, in hippocampal neurons, synaptic activity can lead to a prolonged period of CREB
phosphorylation via the inhibition of PP1 (Bito et al. 1996).

Additional CREB regulatory mechanisms
Although CREB is mainly regulated through phosphorylation, alternate CREB regulatory
mechanisms have been reported, including acetylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and
glycosylation (Lu et al. 2003, Taylor et al. 2000, Comerford et al. 2003, Lamarre-Vincent &
Hsieh-Wilson 2003). For example, CREB is acetylated by CBP at three lysine residues
around the Q1 and KID domains, which enhances CRE-dependent transcription (Lu et al.
2003). In addition, CREB can function as a constitutive transcriptional activator,

independent of Ser 133 phosphorylation. This occurs via the transducers of CREB
regulatory activity (TORC) family of CREB coactivators. TORCs facilitate CREB-mediated
transcription via an association with the bZIP DNA binding domain, which enhances CREB
interactions with components of the basal transcriptional complex (Conkright et al. 2003a).
Within the nervous system, TORCs have been implicated in regulating neuronal
development and plasticity (Finsterwald et al., Zhou et al. 2006).
CREB is also regulated at the translational level. For example, the non-coding small RNA,
miR-34b has been shown to bind to the 3’-UTR of CREB mRNA and repress CREB
expression (Pigazzi et al. 2009). Interestingly, there is an inverse correlation between
miR-34b and CREB expression levels in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (Pigazzi et al.
2009). Recently, miR-134, a brain specific miRNA, was also shown to regulate CREB
expression levels (Gao et al. 2010). Interestingly, within the hippocampus, NAD-dependent
deacetylase SIRT1 deficiency causes increased miR-134 expression, leading to the reduction
of CREB expression and impaired synaptic plasticity (Gao et al. 2010).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To add a further wrinkle, recent work revealed that CREB mRNA is localized to dorsal root
ganglion axons, and, upon nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulation, is translated and
retrogradely transported to the nucleus, driving a pro-survival transcriptional response (Cox
et al. 2008). Additional work that determines how this relatively small pool of CREB could
exert such a profound and specific transcriptional effect will be critical to further this
fascinating line of inquiry. Of note, CREB is also expressed within mitochondria and affects
mitochondrial gene expression and neuronal viability (Lee et al. 2005b).
Finally, CREB transcriptional potential can be regulated at an epigenetic level. Along these
lines, cytosine methylation within CRE sites inhibits CREB binding to DNA, which in turn,
inhibits CRE-dependent transcription (Iguchi-Ariga & Schaffner 1989, Zhang et al. 2005).
This process can be dynamically regulated, and appears to contribute to inducible BDNF
expression in the CNS (Yossifoff et al. 2008).

CREB target genes

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Reporter gene-based methods have been used for years to identify CREB-regulated genes.
These approaches have recently been complemented with bioinformatic based-methods,
combined with microarrays and ChIP-based chromatin occupancy analysis, such as ChIPon-chip and the serial analysis of chromatin occupancy (SACO) (Conkright et al. 2003b,
Fass et al. 2003, McClung & Nestler 2003, Zhang et al. 2005, Impey et al. 2004, Euskirchen
et al. 2004) to interrogate vast regions of the genome for CREB binding and CRE-regulated
gene expression. These studies have revealed a diverse array of both inducible and
constitutively expressed genes that are regulated by CREB. For example, using the SACO
methods, which is a modified ChIP/serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)-based
approach, Impey et al. (2004) identified 6302 CREB binding regions in forskolin-treated
PC12 cells. These data were tested via an affymetrix array, which showed that forskolin
induces 1621 genes, half of which were occupied by CREB (Impey et al. 2004). Of note,
these studies found that the CRE binding motif can be quite variable, diverging from the
‘consensus’ TGACGTCA to highly degenerate motifs where little more than a half-cite of
site (i.e., TGACG) can effectively bind CREB. Further, these studies have revealed that a
large number of neuronally-enriched coding genes are regulated by CREB in an activitydependent manner. These genes, which include neurotransmitters, growth factors,
transcription factors, signal transduction factors, and metabolic enzymes, have critical roles
in neuronal development, plasticity and protection (Tao et al. 1998, Sgambato et al. 1998,
Fukuchi et al. 2005, St-Pierre et al. 2006, Sassone-Corsi et al. 1988, Yagita & Okamura
2000), and as such, CREB has been implicated as a key signaling intermediate that couples

neuronal activity to an array of functional outcomes. Of note, recent studies have revealed
that non-coding small RNA transcription within the nervous system is also regulated by
CREB. Along these lines, the expression from the miR-132/212 locus is tightly regulated by
CREB (Vo et al. 2005, Remenyi et al.). Further, CREB binding is also detected proximal to
the miR219 locus, although its functional significance in miR219 expression has not been
extensively examined (Cheng et al. 2007).

CREB in memory and plasticity
Protein synthesis is an essential step for long term memory formation (Davis & Squire
1984), and work in a number of model systems has clearly established an underlying role for
CREB/CRE-mediated transcription in this process. Along these lines, the first definitive
work linking CREB to long-lasting changes in neuronal functional plasticity was performed
in the mollusk Aplysia, where the induction of long-term, but not short-term, facilitation of
the gill-withdrawal reflex was associated with CREB-mediated gene expression (Schacher et
al. 1988, Dash et al. 1990, Kaang et al. 1993). The phylogenetic conservation of these
findings was supported by work in another invertebrate system, the fruit fly Drosophila
melanogaster, where the overexpression of an inducible dominant negative form of CREB
led to a complete blockade of long-term olfactory memory (Yin et al. 1994).

These seminal observations provided a framework to begin to dissect the role of CREB in
vertebrate synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Some of the most compelling work on
this topic was performed using genetically modified loss- and gain-of function mouse
models. For example, CREB alpha/delta knockout mice showed impaired memory
formation in contextual fear conditioning, the Morris water maze, and social transmitted
food preferences (Bourtchuladze et al. 1994, Kogan et al. 1997). CREB was also shown to
be involved in cued and contextual fear memory, spatial memory, olfactory memory,
conditioned taste aversion memory, and object and social recognition memory
(Bourtchuladze et al. 1994, Kogan et al. 1997, Yin et al. 1994, Lamprecht et al. 1997, Kogan
et al. 2000, Pittenger et al. 2002, Graves et al. 2002). Further, using the CREB alpha/delta
knockout mice as a platform, Han et al., (2007) showed that viral-mediated CREB delivery
to the lateral amygdala completely rescued auditory fear memory impairment (Han et al.
2007). Interestingly, these authors further found that the relative level of CREB activity at
the time of learning is a key factor in determining whether a neuron was recruited into the
memory trace. A caveat to some of these studies was the finding that the disruption CREB
alpha and delta isoforms led to a compensatory upregulation of CREB beta expression
(Blendy et al. 1996), as well as CREM (Hummler et al. 1994). However, other approaches
which employed CREB antisense oligonucleotide-based infusion approaches, and transgenic
approaches in which endogenous CREB is repressed via the expression of a dominant
negative form of CREB (i.e., CREB-S133A and A-CREB) have reported similar deficits in
plasticity and learning to those reported using the CREB alpha/delta knockout mice
(Guzowski & McGaugh 1997, Kida et al. 2002, Jancic et al. 2009). As further support for
CREB in neuronal plasticity and memory, mice that express a constitutively active form of
CREB, VP16-CREB mice, show a lower threshold for the late-phase long-term potentiation
(L-LTP) induction in the Schaffer collateral pathway and an enhanced consolidation of
context and cued fear memory (Barco et al. 2002, Viosca et al. 2009). Further, within the
hippocampus, the dephosphorylation of CREB at Ser 133 is associated with the induction of
long-term depression (LTD) (Mauna et al., Thiels et al. 1998). These data, along with work
by Impey et al. (1998) showing that a CRE-mediated reporter is activated by stimuli that
induce learning and memory reveal a key role for CREB in mammalian memory formation.
Finally, it should be noted that the literature is not completely consistent on the role of
CREB in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Along these lines, work by Balschun et

al. (2003) reported that the conditional disruption of all isoforms of CREB had only limited
effects on hippocampal-dependent cognitive tasks, and no effect on LTP and LTD formation
(Balschun et al. 2003). Additionally, it should also be noted that effects observed in one
brain region might not necessarily extend to other brain regions. Along these lines, in
cerebellar purkinje neurons, CREB-mediated transcription has been implicated in the
induction of the late phase of long-term depression (LTD) (Ahn et al. 1999), a result that
appears to be inconsistent with the role of CREB in the hippocampus. Although the precise
reasons for these disparate physiological effects are not known, the key underlying function
of CREB (converting short-term changes in neuronal activity into long-term changes in
cellular function) is likely conserved throughout the CNS. Hence, whether CREB-mediated
transcription initiates a new baseline state of cellular plasticity that either decreases or
enhances synaptic efficacy likely depends on the underlying synaptic circuitry and cellular
phenotypes.

CREB in neuronal development and cell survival

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CREB has a critical role in nervous system development, and in the neuroprotective
response to pathophysiological effectors. Initial work indicating a role for CREB in
development came from studies in which all CREB isoforms (i.e., alpha, beta, delta) were
inactivated. CREB null mice died immediately after birth and exhibited marked central
nervous system developmental defects including a reduction in the axon projections
comprising the corpus callosum and the anterior commissures (Rudolph et al. 1998).
However, no obvious increases in cell death were detected in the CNS (Lonze et al. 2002).
This limited phenotypic effect may in part result from a compensatory upregulation in the
expression of CREM in the CNS (Rudolph et al. 1998). In support of this interpretation, the
deletion of both Creb1 (all isoforms) and Crem resulted in marked apoptosis, causing a
severe reduction of neuronal and glial precursors during CNS development (Mantamadiotis
et al. 2002). Interestingly, in the developing peripheral nervous system, CREB null (i.e.,
alpha, beta, delta) mice show enhanced apoptosis and impaired growth of sensory neuron
axons (Lonze et al. 2002). At a mechanistic level, this effect appears to be mediated by an
inability of NGF to stimulate CREB-dependent pro-survival and axonal growth
developmental programs (Riccio et al. 1999).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Within the mature CNS, CREB-mediated transcription is required for neuronal survival. For
example, over-expression of a dominant negative CREB (CREB S133A) in the cingulate
cortex of adult mice results in significant apoptosis and cortical neurodegeneration (Ao et al.
2006). In addition, Mantamadiotis et al., (2002) showed that the postnatal deletion of both
CREB and CREM led to hippocampal neurodegeneration in CA1 pyramidal cell layer, as
well as a thinning of the dentate gyrus. Likewise, marked neuronal cell loss was detected in
the dorsal striatum. This finding indicates that CREB has critical roles not only in neuronal
differentiation and development but also in viability of postmitotic neurons (Mantamadiotis
et al. 2002).
A substantial effort has been dedicated to unraveling the molecular mechanisms by which
CREB regulates neuronal survival. Much of this work has centered on the both the
transcription of neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-I), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP),
and leptin, all of which have been shown to affect neuronal survival and development
(Tabuchi et al. 2002, Kingsbury et al. 2003, Lambert et al. 2001, Fukuchi et al. 2005,
Maymo et al., Zhang & Chen 2008), and neurotrophin-regulation of CREB-mediated
transcription. For example, within the peripheral nervous system, NGF and BDNF regulate
sympathetic neuronal survival via CREB-mediated expression of the antiapoptotic gene B
Cell Lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) (Riccio et al. 1999). Another CREB-regulated antiapoptotic gene,

myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1), regulates apoptosis during CNS development
and DNA damage-induced cell death (Wang et al. 1999, Arbour et al. 2008).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given the essential role that CREB plays in nervous system physiology, it might be
reasonable to assume that tonic upregulation of CREB signaling would have beneficial
effects. However, recent work has revealed deleterious consequences to sustained CREB
activation. Indeed, using a tetracycline-inducible constitutively active VP16-CREB
transgenic mouse model, Lopez de Armentia et al., (2007) showed that chronic activation of
CRE-mediated gene expression (2-3 weeks) led to epileptic seizures and a marked loss of
hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, neuronal degeneration resulting from CREB inhibition
and CREB activation appears to occur through distinct mechanistic processes. While
inhibition of CREB triggers neuronal cell death via a pro-apoptotic process (Ao et al. 2006),
chronic CREB activation triggers cell death via an excitotoxic mechanism (Valor et al.,
Lopez de Armentia et al. 2007). Gene profiling indicated that chronic CREB activation
stimulates the induction of cell stress and inflammatory genes, which likely actuate or
contribute to the excitotoxic cell loss (Lopez de Armentia et al. 2007). These data provide
important considerations for the development of therapeutic strategies designed to augment
CREB-dependent transcription.

CREB regulation under physiological and pathophysiological conditions
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The examination of CREB phosphorylation at Ser 133 has provided useful insights into how
physiological and pathophysiological levels of neuronal activity regulate CRE-mediated
transcription. Central to this body of work is the idea that there are ‘permissive’ levels of
neuronal activity, which allow robust CREB phosphorylation (and in turn CRE-mediated
transcription), and that there are pathophysiological levels of neuronal activity that trigger
CREB dephosphorylation, which in turn blocks neuroprotective CRE-mediated signaling.
As a seminal work in this literature, Hardingham et al. (2002) showed that there are
functionally distinct synaptic (neuroprotective) and extrasynaptic (excitotoxic) NMDA
receptor complexes with oppositional effects on CREB phosphorylation, anti-apoptotic gene
expression and cell viability (Hardingham et al. 2002). Paralleling this, Lee et al. (2005)
showed that excitotoxic levels of glutamate receptor activity selectively stimulate the
phosphatase calcineurin, which leads to rapid CREB Ser 133 dephosphorylation (via PP1),
and a blockade of CRE-mediated transcription. Interestingly, calcineurin inhibition
attenuates glutamate toxicity and converts the transient glutamate-evoked increase in CREB
phosphorylation into a long-lasting elevation (~3 hrs). Taken to a whole-animal context,
these studies would suggest that in response to excitotoxic challenges, neurons within an
excitotoxic foci (i.e., the ‘core’ region) would exhibit limited CREB phosphorylation,
whereas cells in ‘penumbral’ regions would exhibit elevated CREB phosphorylation, which
would reflect a potentially neuroprotective response (Lee et al. 2005a). Indeed, in a 3nitropropionic acid (3-NP) model of Huntington’s disease (HD), CREB phosphorylation was
potently repressed prior to cell death within the neurotoxic striatal core region, whereas
robust CREB phosphorylation (as well as Bcl-2 expression) was detected in the penumbral
region (Choi et al. 2009). Likewise, in a cerebral ischemia model, both CREB
phosphorylation and CRE-mediated gene expression were limited to penumbral regions
(Irving et al. 2000, Sugiura et al. 2004). In something of a parallel to these studies, Walton
& Dragunow (2000) used a hypoxic-ischemia model to show that CREB Ser 133 is
selectively phosphorylated in dentate granule cells, a hippocampal cell layer which showed
marked resistance to cell death (Walton & Dragunow 2000).
Although CREB phosphorylation at Ser 133 is a useful marker of cell viability, there are
many other phosphorylation sites on CREB (described above) that regulate CREBdependent transcription. Along these lines, it is worth restating that in response to genotoxic

stress, CREB is phosphorylated at Ser 121 and Ser 271 by ATM and HIPK2, respectively
(Dodson & Tibbetts 2006, Sakamoto et al.). Ser 121 phosphorylation inhibits CREB
dependent transcription, while Serine 271 phosphorylation activates it. Of note, Ser 271
phosphorylation-dependent transcription is independent of Ser 133 phosphorylation
(Hailemariam et al.). Collectively, these data suggest that there is a myriad of complex,
context specific, kinase signaling events that regulate CREB transactivation, and, in turn cell
survival.

CREB and oxidative stress
In addition to the ability of CREB to regulate neuroprotection via the upregulation of
neurotrophins and anti-apoptotic genes, recent studies indicate that CREB also protects
neurons via the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification. Along these
lines CREB has also been shown to stimulate the expression of antioxidant genes including
heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) (Gong et al. 2002, Kronke et al. 2003) and manganese superoxide
dismutase (MnSOD) (Kim et al., 1999). CREB also regulates a broad class of antioxidant
genes via the inducible expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) (Herzig et al. 2001). St. Pierre et al. (2006) showed that CREB
binds to the PGC-1α enhancer region and that hydrogen peroxide-induced PGC-1α
expression is repressed by either mutating the CRE site or disruption of CREB binding.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The work of St. Pierre et al. was nicely supported in an in vivo investigation that employed
an A-CREB transgenic mouse line. In this study, Lee et al. (2009) showed that the
attenuation of CRE-mediated gene expression led to a marked increase in seizure-induced
ROS production. Paralleling this, there was a reduction in both basal and inducible PGC-1α
and HO-1 expression. Importantly, seizure-induced cell death was significantly increased in
A-CREB mice, relative to non-transgenic controls. Finally, in neuronal culture, disruption of
CREB-mediated transcription significantly increased vulnerability to ROS-induced cell
toxicity (Lee et al. 2009). These data suggest that CREB functions as an essential upstream
effector of neuroprotective signaling against ROS-mediated cell toxicity.

CREB and pre-conditioning-evoked neuroprotection

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The ability of CREB to drive neuroprotective signaling in an activity-dependent manner
raised the interesting prospect that CREB plays a key role in the well-characterized
preconditioning response that attenuates the effects of subsequent toxic stimuli. Support for
this idea has come from studies showing that CRE-mediated transcription is activated by
ischemic preconditioning stimuli (Mabuchi et al. 2001). Further, the disruptions of CREmediated gene expression, via the in vivo infusion of a CRE decoy oligonucleotide
markedly diminished the effectiveness of a preconditioning stimulus (Hara et al. 2003).
Similarly, Lee et al., (2009) showed that the efficacy of a BDNF ‘preconditioning’
microinjection against seizure-induced cell death was inhibited by the repression of CREBmediated transcription (Lee et al. 2009). Together, these data clearly indicate that the CREB/
CRE transcriptional pathway is an underlying mechanism by which preconditioning exerts
its neuroprotective effects.

CREB and disorders of the CNS
CREB dysregulation has been implicated in a number of congenital as well as acquired
disorders of the CNS, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s
disease (HD), Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, ischemia, alcoholism, schizophrenia, addiction,
and depression (Chalovich et al. 2006, Ma et al. 2007, Nucifora et al. 2001, Roelfsema &
Peters 2007, Walton & Dragunow 2000, Wand 2005, Sawamura et al. 2008, Carlezon et al.
2005).

Among these disorders, the relevance of CREB to the pathogenesis of HD has been most
intensively investigated. HD is an autosomal dominant heritable disease that is characterized
by anemia and uncontrolled body movements, which are associated with the degeneration of
striatal medium spiny neurons. The causative gene, Huntingtin (Htt), normally has less than
35 CAG triplet sequence repeats on the 5’ region of its first exon and is transcribed as a long
N terminal glutamine tail. However mutant Htt has over 35 CAG repeats, thus making an
abnormally long glutamine tail. At a mechanistic level, inhibition of CREB-dependent
transcription appears to be a principal mechanism by which mutant Htt leads to HD (Gil &
Rego 2008, Semaka et al. 2006). Mutant Htt has been shown to interact with CBP and, in
turn, repress CREB-dependent transcription (Nucifora et al. 2001). In an interesting parallel,
genetic disruption of CREB leads to a pattern of striatal degeneration similar to that seen in
HD (Mantamadiotis et al. 2002). Of note, another line of work has shown that CREmediated gene expression is enhanced in early stages of disease progression (Obrietan &
Hoyt 2004), thus suggesting that mild striatal pathology leads to a protective program of
CREB-dependent transcription, and that only during the later stages of the disease
(ostensibly when CBP is sufficiently complexed) is CREB-dependent transcription
repressed, thus accelerating disease progression.

Conclusion
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Collectively, these studies indicate that CREB is a key component of diverse physiological
processes, including nervous system development, cell survival, plasticity, as well as
learning and memory. Importantly, dysregulation of the CREB transcriptional cascade
following an array of neurodegenerative disorders will likely lead to profound effects on cell
viability and cognitive function: two processes that, to date, have limited or no prospect of
treatment. Indeed, these studies raise the possibility that carefully calibrated and targeted
therapeutic strategies focusing on augmentation of CREB-mediated transcription may prove
beneficial both for the enhancement of synaptic plasticity and the promotion of
neuroprotection following CNS injury and various neuropathologies.
