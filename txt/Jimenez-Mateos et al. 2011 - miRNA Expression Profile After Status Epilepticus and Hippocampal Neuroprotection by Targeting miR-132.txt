The brain possesses endogenous molecular mechanisms by which it can protect itself from harm, although
forewarning is required to bring protection optimally to
bear. Thus, mild noxious stressors such as brief ischemia
or brief seizures evoke protective adaptations in the
brain, which render it powerfully refractory against a subsequent and otherwise damaging insult.1–3 The effect of
the stressor has been termed preconditioning, and the
protected state after the damaging insult is termed tolerance. Our understanding of the molecular processes underlying tolerance has been helped by microarray profiling. Such profiling has revealed large-scale, genomic
reprogramming of the response to injury involving altered
expression of hundreds of genes.4,5 The prominent transcriptional response in tolerant brain is gene down-regulation.6 – 8 In ischemic tolerance, the most affected processes are metabolism, transport, and inflammation,6,7
whereas the genes altered in epileptic tolerance encode
ion channels, excitatory neurotransmitter receptors, and
calcium signaling components.8
The mechanism by which gene expression is altered in
tolerance is unknown, but a contribution by microRNAs
(miRNAs) has recently been proposed.9 –11 The miRNAs

When an otherwise harmful insult to the brain is preceded by a brief, noninjurious stimulus, the brain becomes tolerant, and the resulting damage is reduced.
Epileptic tolerance develops when brief seizures precede an episode of prolonged seizures (status epilepticus). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs
that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene
expression. We investigated how prior seizure preconditioning affects the miRNA response to status epilepticus evoked by intra-amygdalar kainic acid in mice. The
miRNA was extracted from the ipsilateral CA3 subfield
24 hours after focal-onset status epilepticus in animals
that had previously received either seizure preconditioning (tolerance) or no preconditioning (injury), and
mature miRNA levels were measured using TaqMan lowdensity arrays. Expression of 21 miRNAs was increased,
relative to control, after status epilepticus alone, and
expression of 12 miRNAs was decreased. Increased miR132 levels were matched with increased binding to Argonaute-2, a constituent of the RNA-induced silencing
complex. In tolerant animals, expression responses
of >40% of the injury-group-detected miRNAs differed, being either unchanged relative to control or
down-regulated, and this included miR-132. In vivo

are a family of small (⬃22 nucleotides), endogenously
expressed, noncoding RNAs that regulate mRNA translation by imperfect base-pairing interactions within the 3=
untranslated region (UTR).12 Several hundred miRNAs
have been identified in mammals, and miRNAs may be
capable of regulating post-transcriptional expression
of one-third or more of the protein-coding genes.13–15
Biogenesis begins with transcription by either RNA
polymerase II or III to generate a pri-miRNA. Nuclear
processing via Drosha, an RNase III endonuclease,
produces a pre-miRNA that is then exported to the
cytoplasm for processing by Dicer to the mature double-strand miRNA.16,17 One strand is then loaded into
the RNA-induced silencing complex, which contains
argonaute proteins and, depending on sequence complementarity, directs mRNA degradation or translational repression of the target mRNA.18
The miRNA system exhibits dynamic spatiotemporal
expression during brain development.19,20 Physiological
and pathological neuronal activity also modulate expression of miRNA genes,21,22 and miR-132 (along with other
miRNAs) regulates neuronal structure.23–26 Loss of biogenesis components (eg, Dicer) results in neurodegeneration within some, but not all, brain regions.27–29 Roles
for miRNA dysfunction have been proposed in acute
neurological injury and neurodegenerative diseases.30,31
In the present study, we used expression profiling to
examine how the miRNA response to status epilepticus
evoked by intra-amygdalar kainic acid (KA) is altered in a
model of epileptic tolerance previously developed by our
group.32 We then used a small-molecule-inhibitor approach to model the changes brought on by tolerance
and to test whether miRNAs contribute in vivo to seizureinduced neuronal death.

Materials and Methods
Animal Model of Epileptic Tolerance
All animal experiments were performed in accordance
with European Communities Council Directive 86/609/
EEC and were reviewed and approved by the Research
Ethics Committee of the Royal College of Surgeons in
Ireland, under license from the Department of Health,
Dublin, Ireland. Adult male C57BL/6 mice (20 to 22 g)
from Harlan (Oxon, Bicester, UK) were used. Control
mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 mL
saline on day 1 (sham preconditioning), followed by intraamygdalar vehicle on day 2 (0.2 ␮L PBS). Injury group
mice also received intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 mL
saline on day 1, and then underwent status epilepticus
induced by intra-amygdalar KA (Sigma-Aldrich, Dublin, Ireland; St. Louis, MO) on day 2. Tolerance mice
underwent seizure preconditioning on day 1 via intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 mL KA (15 mg/kg), and then
underwent status epilepticus on day 2 induced by intra-amygdalar KA.

Surgical Procedures
For intra-amygdalar injections, mice were anesthetized
with isoflurane (5% induction, 1% to 2% maintenance)
and placed in a mouse-adapted stereotaxic frame. Body
temperature was maintained within the normal physiological range with a rectal thermometer and feedback-controlled heat pad (Harvard Apparatus, Kent, UK; Holliston,
MA). After a midline scalp incision, the bregma was located and three partial craniectomies were performed for
placement of skull-mounted recording screws (Bilaney
Consultants, Sevenoaks, Kent, UK). A complete craniectomy was drilled for placement of a guide cannula for
intra-amygdalar injections (coordinates from bregma:
AP ⫽ ⫺0.94 mm, L ⫽ ⫺2.85 mm), based on a stereotaxic
atlas.33 The cannula and electrode assembly was fixed in
place with dental cement and the animal was placed in a
recording chamber. The electroencephalogram (EEG)
was recorded using a Grass Comet XL laboratory-based
EEG system (Grass Technologies, Slough, UK; West
Warwick, RI). After baseline EEG recordings, the animal
was lightly restrained while an injection cannula was lowered 3.75 mm below the brain surface for injection of KA
(1 ␮g) or vehicle in a volume of 0.2 ␮L into the basolateral
amygdala nucleus. After 40 minutes, all mice received
lorazepam (Ativan; 6 mg/kg, i.p.). Animals were recorded
for up to 1 hour thereafter, before being disconnected
and placed in a warmed recovery chamber.
For intracerebroventricular injections, additional mice
were affixed with a cannula ipsilateral to the site of KA
injection, as described previously.34 Coordinates from
the bregma were AP ⫽ ⫺0.3 mm, L ⫽ ⫺1.0 mm, V ⫽
⫺2.0 mm. Mice received 2 ␮L infusion of either scrambled or miR-132 antagomir (locked nucleic acid LNAand 3=-cholesterol-modified oligonucleotides; Exiqon,
Vedbaek, Denmark) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (Harvard Apparatus). Twenty-four hours later, mice were either euthanized or were subjected to status epilepticus,
as described above.
Mice were euthanized at 24 hours after intra-amygdalar injections. Animals were given a pentobarbital overdose and were perfused with ice-cold saline to remove
intravascular blood components. Brains for molecular
and biochemical work were dissected on dry ice under a
microscope and the hippocampus was subdivided to
obtain the separate CA3-enriched portion, as described
previously.8 For histology, mice were first perfused with
ice-cold saline and then either perfusion-fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) or brains were fresh-frozen in 2-methylbutane at ⫺30°C.

Electroencephalography Analysis
EEGs were analyzed using TWin software v3.8 (Grass
Technologies), and the duration of high-amplitude,
high-frequency discharges (also termed type IV seizures) was calculated between the time of KA injection
and the time of lorazepam administration.35 Additional
frequency and amplitude analysis of EEG was performed using LabChart Pro version 7 software (ADInstruments, Oxford, UK).

miRNA Extraction and Expression Profiling of
Pooled miRNAs
Total mRNA was extracted using an miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK; Valencia, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions to obtain an enrichment of
small RNAs. For each condition, ipsilateral CA3 subfields
from three separate mice were pooled together for analysis, and this was repeated using independent samples.
Quality and quantity of mRNA was measured using a
NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Loughborough, UK; Wilmington, DE), and RNA dilutions were
made up in nuclease-free water. Reverse transcription of
250 ng of miRNA from the CA3 subfields from each
condition was performed using stem-loop multiplex
primer pools (Applied Biosystems, Paisley, UK; Foster
City, CA), allowing reverse transcription of 48 different
miRNAs in each of eight RT pools. The miRNA quantitative PCR (qPCR) screen was performed on the 7900HT
fast real-time system using TaqMan low-density arrays
(TaqMan TLDA MicroRNA assays version 1.0 containing
380 human microRNAs assays; Applied Biosystems). Of
the profiled human miRNAs, 197 were 100% homologous
to mouse. miRNAs were considered differentially expressed at a threshold of ⫾1.5-fold.36

Stem-Loop Reverse Transcription and RealTime qPCR of Individual miRNAs
Reverse transcription for individual qPCRs was performed using 250 ng of total RNA and a high-capacity
reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems); RT-specific primers for mouse miRNAs miR-27a, miR-92a, miR101, miR-127, miR-132, miR-145, miR-200a, and miR-326
(Applied Biosystems) were used for all miRNA reverse
transcription. Individual qPCRs were performed on the
7900HT fast real-time system (Applied Biosystems) using
miR-27a, miR-92a, miR-101, miR-127, miR-132, miR-145,
miR-200a, and miR326-specific TaqMan microRNA assays (Applied Biosystems). RNU19 was used for normalization miRNA expression studies, as described previously.37 A relative fold change in expression of the target
gene transcript was determined using the comparative
cycle threshold method (2⫺⌬⌬CT).

Western Blotting
Western blot analysis was performed as described
previously.38 Hippocampal CA3 subfields were homogenized in a lysis buffer, boiled in gel-loading buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes. The following primary antibodies were used: Drosha (1:400; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), Dicer-1 (1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Argonaute-2 (Ago-2) (1:
400; Cell Signaling Technology), and Tubulin (1:2000,
Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes were then incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and
bands were visualized using Pierce SuperSignal West

Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Images were captured using a
Fuji-Film LAS-300 (Fuji, Sheffield, UK), and densitometry was performed using AlphaEaseFC4.0 gel-scanning integrated optical density software (Alpha Innotech;
ProteinSimple, San Leandro, CA).

Immunoprecipitation of Argonaute-2 (Ago-2)
Pools of three individual mouse CA3 subfields from each
condition were homogenized in 0.7 mL of ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (300 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 0.1% NP-40, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.5). The
homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 ⫻ g for 15 minutes at 4°C and the supernatant was considered as the
total cell lysate. Five micrograms of anti-Ago-2 was
added to each 400 ␮g of supernatant in a final volume of
1 mL. The solution was vortex-mixed and incubated overnight at 4°C. After addition of 20 ␮L of 50% protein-A/Gagarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), the solution
was mixed and incubated for 1 hour at 4°C. The beads
were centrifuged at 16,000 ⫻ g for 15 minutes at 4°C, and
the supernatant was removed. The pellet was washed
twice with immunoprecipitation buffer, and miRNA was
extracted using an miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, West Sussex,
UK). Stem-loop reverse transcription and real-time qPCR
(Applied Biosystems) was performed as described
above to semiquantify the expression of the miRNA.

Histopathology
To characterize seizure-damage in the model, brains
from control, injury, and tolerance mice were sectioned at
12 ␮m on a cryostat (⫺20°C) at the level of either rostral
(AP ⫽ ⫺1.58 mm) or medial (AP ⫽ ⫺1.82 mm) hippocampus.33 Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) staining was performed as described previously.8,39 Briefly, tissue sections were allowed to air-dry and then were postfixed in
formalin (10%), immersed in 0.006% potassium permanganate solution, rinsed again, and then transferred to FJB
solution (0.001% in 0.1% acetic acid) (Millipore-Chemicon Europe, Chandlers Ford, UK; Billerica, MA). Sections
were then rinsed again, dried, cleared, and mounted in
DPX mounting medium (Sigma-Aldrich). Analysis of DNA
damage was performed on fresh-frozen sections using a
fluorescein-based TUNEL technique, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI) and
as described previously.38
For assessment of neuron loss, sections were fixed,
blocked in 5% goat serum, and incubated with antibodies
against neuronal nuclear protein (1:500 NeuN; Millipore
Ireland, Tullagreen, Cork, Ireland), which was detected
using goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 (Bio-Sciences,
Dun Laoghaire, Ireland). Sections were examined using a
Nikon 2000s epifluorescence microscope (Micron Optical, Enniscorthy, Ireland) under excitation/emission (Ex/
Em) wavelengths of 472/520 nm (green) and 540 to 580/
600 to 660 nm (red). Pseudocolor transforms from
monochromatic images acquired using an Orca-285 digital camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City,
Japan) were generated using Adobe Photoshop version

6.0 software. Cell counts were performed for the entire
CA3 subfield, beginning at the border with CA2
through to the end of CA3c/CA4 within the hilus of the
dentate gyrus. Counts of FJB-, TUNEL- and NeuNstained cells were the average of two adjacent sections assessed by an observer blinded to experimental
group and condition.

In Situ Hybridization
For in situ hybridization, mice (n ⫽ 3) were perfused with
ice-cold PBS followed by paraformaldehyde (4%). Sections (12 ␮m thick) were mounted on SuperFrost-Plus
slides (VWR International, Radnor, PA) and air dried.
Using RNase free solutions, slides were washed with PBS
and radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [150 mL
NaCl, 1% (octylphenoxy)polyethoxyethanol (IGEPAL)],
0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
50 mmol/L Tris pH 8.0) for 5 minutes, then treated with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes. Sections were washed
again and treated with 0.25% acetic anhydride/0.1 mol/L
triethanolamine, then rinsed with 0.1% Tween-20/PBS for
5 minutes, treated with 5 ␮g/mL proteinase K for 4 minutes, and washed with PBS. Next, slides were rinsed in
prehybridization buffer (1⫻ saline solution, 50% formamide, and 1⫻ Denhardt’s solution) for 1 hour at 56°C (melting temperature Tm ⫽ ⫺20°C, as specified by Exiqon).
The probe to detect mi-132 was 5=-digoxigenin-labeled,
2=-O,4=-C-methylene bicyclonucleoside monomer-containing oligonucleotide (LNA-modified). The sequence
was the reverse complement to the mature miRNA.
Probes were incubated 1:200 in hybridization buffer (1⫻
saline solution, 50% formamide, and 1⫻ Denhardt’s plus
10% dextran sulfate) overnight at 56°C in a humidified
chamber. On the next day, sections were washed in FAM
buffer (2⫻ SSC, 50% formamide, and 0.1% Tween 20) for
1 hour at 60°C. Then sections were rinsed in B1 buffer
(150 mmol/L NaCl, 100 mmol/L maleic acid, and 0.4%
IGEPAL pH, 7.5) for 1 hour at room temperature and in B2
buffer (2% blocking reagent and 10% goat serum in B1
buffer) for 30 minutes. Anti-DIG-PA antibody (1:1000;
Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) was incubated
in B2 buffer overnight at 4°C. On the next day, sections
were washed in B1 buffer and incubated in B3 buffer (100
mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.025% Tween 20 and
100 mmol/L Trizma pH9.5) for 30 minutes. Then, 200 ␮L
of color substrate solution [nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BNT/BCIP stock solution;
Roche Applied Science)] diluted 1:50 in B3 buffer was
added to each slide until the signal appeared. Slides
were then rinsed, mounted, and coverslipped.

Results
Reduced Hippocampal CA3 Damage after
Status Epilepticus in Epileptic Tolerance
In our experimental paradigm (Figure 1A), status epilepticus was focally evoked by intra-amygdalar KA. This
approach avoids direct neurotoxin-associated effects
that could complicate attributing miRNA changes to seizures alone (eg, in models in which KA is injected either
systemically or intrahippocampally). The histopathological features of the tolerance model were as previously
reported.8,32,39 In non-preconditioned mice subjected to
status epilepticus (ie, in the injury group), the ipsilateral
hippocampal CA3 subfield was extensively damaged, as
evidenced by FJB staining at 24 hours (Figure 1, B and D).
In this model, only few FJB-positive cells are found in the
ipsilateral CA1 subfield (Figure 1D). FJB staining was consistently found within the CA4/hilar region of the dentate
gyrus, but not in the granule cell layer (Figure 1D). Hippocampal CA3 damage was significantly reduced in mice
given seizure preconditioning 24 hours before status epilepticus (tolerance group; Figure 1, B and D). The duration
of high-amplitude, high-frequency electrographic seizures
did not show a significant difference between injury and
tolerance mice (Figure 1, E and F). Thus, seizure preconditioning reduces hippocampal damage independently of
changes to the overall severity of the status epilepticus.
Because in this model the CA3 subfield was the major
site for both damage and protection from damage, we performed all biochemical and molecular studies on the isolated CA3 subfield. This was achieved by microdissection
(as described under Materials and Methods) with minimized
contamination of undamaged or minimally injured fields that
might obscure or dilute miRNA changes. CA3 samples
were confirmed as being enriched by real-time qPCR analysis of the CA3-specific gene bok,40 which was present in
CA3 but nearly absent from CA1 samples (Figure 1C).

miRNA Biogenesis Pathway in Injury and Tolerance
To establish the presence of miRNA biogenesis pathway
components in the model, we examined expression of
Dicer, Drosha, and Ago-2 by Western blotting. Each protein was present in the CA3 subfield in control, injury, and
tolerance mice at 24 hours. All three proteins were present
at the predicted molecular weight: Drosha at ⬃160 kDa,
Dicer at ⬃220 kDa, and Ago-2 (also known as eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 2C 2) at ⬃90 kDa (Figure 2A).
Protein levels of each were not significantly altered in animals subjected to status epilepticus (Figure 2B).

three different experimental groups (Figure 3A). A total of
45 mature miRNAs were called as present in the CA3
subfield of nonseizure control mice on the basis of qPCR
detection in two independent experiments under the cutoff point (ⱕ35 cycle times).
There were prominent changes to miRNA expression
in mice subjected to status epilepticus alone (Figure 3A
and Table 1). Compared with control, 54% of miRNAs
were increased in expression after status epilepticus and
⬃21% were decreased (Figure 3B). Expression of ⬃25%

of the remaining detected miRNAs was unchanged after
status epilepticus (Figure 3B). All miRNAs present in the
injury group were also detected in control animals,
whereas miR-518b, miR-518c, miR-520c, and miR-520g
were below cutoff in both injury and tolerance mice. The
miRNAs showing altered expression after status epilepticus are listed in Table 1. The median miRNA up-regulation in injury was 5.4-fold; however, the scale of miRNA
up-regulation was dramatic for several miRNAs, including ⬎20-fold for miR-132, miR-219 and miR-323 and between ⬃45-fold and ⬃144 fold for miR-21, miR-507, and

down-regulated miRNAs included 22-fold decrease for
miR-657 and ⬎50-fold decrease for miR-520b.

Altered miRNA Profile in Epileptic Tolerance
The miRNA response to status epilepticus in preconditioned mice differed in several aspects from that generated
by status epilepticus alone (Figure 3 and Table 1). Only a
fraction (18%) of miRNA expression was increased in epileptic tolerance, compared with the control; a much larger

proportion was down-regulated (⬃60%). The proportion of
miRNAs that remained unchanged relative to control was
similar to that of the injury group (⬃25%) (Figure 3B). One
miRNA (miR-629) was uniquely expressed in epileptic tolerance samples, but it was outside the 35-cycle cutoff point
in the control and injury groups.
The overlap between injury and tolerance for up-regulated and down-regulated miRNAs is shown as Venn
diagrams in Figure 3C. Five miRNAs were up-regulated in
both injury and tolerance groups; 15 miRNAs were
uniquely up-regulated in the injury group and 1 miRNA
was uniquely up-regulated in the tolerance group.
Among the up-regulated miRNAs common to both
groups, the scale of increase was usually greater in the
injury than in the tolerance group.
Among down-regulated miRNAs, 12 were common to
both injury and tolerance groups (Figure 3, C and D).
There were no uniquely down-regulated miRNAs in the
injury group (Figure 3, C and D). In the tolerance group,
eight miRNAs were uniquely down-regulated. The scale
of down-regulation was typically greater in tolerance than
injury for a given miRNA (Table 1).
Of particular note, a subset of miRNAs displayed opposite regulation between injury and tolerance. Expression of miR-27a, miR-200a, and miR-326 were all increased after status epilepticus alone, but were
decreased in epileptic tolerance.

Validation of TaqMan Screen
To validate the TLDA card results, we chose a selection of
miRNAs from among those up-regulated in injury (miR-132,
miR-200a, and miR-326) and those down-regulated in tolerance (miR-101, miR-127 and miR-145) for individual realtime qPCR verification using miRNA specific primers (as
described in Materials and Methods). Individual qPCR validation of the screening results showed high reproducibility
(Figure 4 and Figure 5B). However, the scale of the fold
increase or decrease tended to be at variance between the
two methods. In particular, the very high levels of up-regulation seen for some miRNAs with the TLDA approach
were more limited with the individual qPCR. One miRNA
reported to be up-regulated in injury on the TLDA analysis

Increased Binding of miR-132 to Ago-2 after
Status Epilepticus
Among the differentially expressed miRNAs, the predominance of up-regulation among injury genes and down-regulation or lack of change in tolerance implies that neuroprotection may be due in part to reduced levels of certain
miRNAs. We selected miR-132 (Table 1) as a candidate for
further analysis because the strong up-regulation seen in
injury was completely prevented in tolerance, and also because it is has been shown to have a role in regulating
neuronal structure,23,26,41 but has not previously been
linked to control of neuronal death.
In situ hybridization was first used to confirm that miR132 is constitutively expressed in CA3 pyramidal neurons
in the mouse hippocampus (Figure 5A). Next, using individual real-time qPCR we confirmed that miR-132 was

up-regulated in the CA3 subfield after status epilepticus
alone, but levels were the same as control in seizurepreconditioned mice subjected to status epilepticus (Figure 5B). We also examined the expression of miR-132 in
the CA1 subfield, which is not significantly damaged in
the injury model. In contrast to findings for CA3, miR-132
was not up-regulated in the CA1 subfield after status
epilepticus alone (Figure 5B).
Ago-2 both contributes to miRNA-mRNA pairing and
influences whether mRNA stability is reduced or mRNA is
cleaved.16 –18 We next asked whether increased levels of
mature miRNA also lead to increased loading into the
RNA-induced silencing complex. Accordingly, we examined miR-132 association with Ago-2 using CA3 samples
from the injury group. Ago-2 was readily immunoprecipitated from hippocampal CA3 lysates (Figure 5C). Ago-2
was then immunoprecipitated from control and seizuredamaged CA3 subfields at 24 hours and bound miRNA was
extracted (Figure 5C). Ago-2-eluted miR-132 was then identified by PCR. miR-132 was present at low levels in Ago-2

miRNAs in Epileptic Tolerance

immunoprecipitates in control CA3 lysates (Figure 5D). Levels of miR-132 were significantly increased in Ago-2 samples from seizure-damaged mice (Figure 5D). As a control
for the specificity of the miR-132 finding, we analyzed expression of miR-27a, a second seizure-up-regulated
miRNA. miR-27a was also detected after Ago-2 pull-down
assay, but levels were not increased relative to control (Figure 5D). Thus, increased loading of miRNAs into Ago-2 is
not typical for all seizure-up-regulated miRNAs.

In Vivo Depletion of miR-132 Using Antagomirs
To determine whether miR-132 contributed to neuronal
death after seizures in vivo, we used locked nucleic acid
(LNA)-modified and 3= cholesterol-conjugated anti-miR132 oligonucleotides (ie, antagomirs) to reduce brain levels of miR-132 before status epilepticus. Previous work
has shown that antagomirs cause a pronounced reduction of their miRNA targets.42– 44 In our experiments, miR132 antagomirs or a nontargeting scrambled version
were injected intracerebroventricularly into mice at various doses. Effective miRNA depletion was confirmed by
extracting the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus and
measuring miRNA levels by individual real-time qPCR. A
dose of 0.5 nmol antagomir significantly reduced miR132 levels at 24 hours, whereas 0.12 nmol had no effect
(Figure 6A). The same dose (0.5 nmol) of scrambled
antagomir had no effect on miR-132 levels. Suppression
of miR-132 was greater when 1.0 nmol of antagomir was
injected (Figure 6A); however, the matching dose of
scrambled antagomir also depleted miR-132 from brain
(Figure 6A). As a further control, we examined the effects
of miR-132 antagomirs and scrambled antagomirs on the
levels of miR-92a, an unrelated miRNA (Figure 6B). Injection of 0.12 or 0.5 nmol of miR-132 antagomir or
scrambled antagomir did not alter expression of miR-92a
(Figure 6B). In contrast, at the highest dose of scrambled
antagomir (1.0 nmol), but not of miR-132-targeting antagomirs, levels of miR-92a were significantly reduced
(P ⬍ 0.0001; Figure 6B).

Effects of Antagomirs on the Hippocampus and
EEG Parameters
To determine whether anti-miR-132 or scrambled antagomir injection had any general cytotoxic effects, we performed neuron counts and stained for FJB and irreversible DNA damage using TUNEL.38 Counts of NeuNimmunostained sections at the level of rostral and medial
hippocampus from mice injected 24 hours earlier with 0.5
nmol of the antagomirs revealed no neuron loss (Figure
6C). No FJB staining was evident in hippocampal sections from mice injected with either scrambled or miR-132
antagomir (data not shown). No TUNEL-positive cells
were found in scrambled antagomir-injected mice in either rostral or medial hippocampus. A single TUNELpositive cell was present in rostral hippocampus from one
miR-132 antagomir-injected mouse. In sections from the
medial hippocampus, two miR-132 antagomir mice had a
single TUNEL-positive cell and one mouse had two

TUNEL-positive cells. These differences were not significant, compared with the scrambled antagomir group
(data not shown).
Because miR-132 regulates neuronal structures both in
vitro and in vivo,24,26,45 we explored whether seizures
were different in mice with depleted miR-132. Mice were
injected with 0.5 nmol anti-miR-132 or scrambled antagomir injection 24 hours before induction of status epilepticus. Analysis of multiple components of the EEG recorded at the time of status epilepticus (ie, duration of
high-amplitude, high-frequency discharges, EEG total
power, and EEG frequency) revealed no significant differences (Figure 6, D–F).

Depletion of miR-132 Protects Hippocampal
CA3 against Status Epilepticus
Last, we examined tissue sections from mice 24 hours
after status epilepticus that received either 0.5 nmol of
the antagomir targeting miR-132 or the scrambled version. No animals died after status epilepticus in either
group. Scrambled-treated mice subjected to status epilepticus displayed typical CA3 damage in the rostral hippocampus as evidenced by FJB staining, TUNEL, and
loss of NeuN staining (Figure 7, A and D). In contrast,
mice injected with anti-miR-132 showed significantly
fewer FJB counts, less TUNEL staining, and significantly
more surviving neurons (Figure 7, A, C, and D). Analysis
of the medial hippocampus showed the same protective
trend (Figure 7, B and C). That is, anti-miR-132 significantly reduced FJB and TUNEL counts, and increased
numbers of surviving neurons. Representative FJB,
TUNEL, and NeuN staining of the medial hippocampus
for each group is shown in Figure 7D.
Finally, a statistical analysis46,47 of the relationship between seizure damage and seizure duration in scrambled
and miR-132 antagomir-treated mice was performed (see
Supplemental Figure S1 at http://ajp.amjpathol.org). The
analysis revealed a significant correlation between seizure
duration and seizure damage in scrambled antagomirtreated mice; this association was lost in animals injected with
miR-132 antagomir. Thus, by protecting against seizure-induced neuronal death, miR-132 antagomir uncoupled the relationship between seizure duration and damage.

Discussion
In the present study, we characterized the transcriptional
response of mature miRNAs to status epilepticus evoked
by intra-amygdalar KA and showed this to be altered in
the hippocampus of tolerant mice (ie, preconditioned
animals). Compared with status epilepticus alone, miRNA
expression responses in tolerance were often reduced or
were regulated in the opposite direction. We also showed
that in vivo depletion of miR-132, one of the differentially
up-regulated miRNAs in injury, reduced neuronal death
after status epilepticus. These findings contribute to our
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tolerance
and support miRNAs as novel determinants of seizureinduced neuronal death.

From initial work on single metabolites and genes,48 –51
an appreciation has emerged that tolerance is associated with large-scale, genomic reprogramming that involves altered expression of hundreds of genes.4,5,7 The
present study builds on our understanding of the molecular processes that underlie epileptic tolerance and introduces an important new contributor, namely, miRNAs.
Previously, microarray analyses showed that the response of protein-coding genes in the CA3 subfield of the
hippocampus to status epilepticus is profoundly altered
in animals previously preconditioned by brief seizures,
with widespread down-regulation, particularly of genes
implicated in excitotoxicity.8 Our present results show
that status epilepticus also produces profound changes
in the expression of miRNAs. Expression of more than
half the detected mature miRNAs increased in the hippocampus in the injury group, indicating major transcriptional regulation of miRNAs. Because miRNAs are capa-

ble of regulating large numbers of mRNA transcripts, our
data support other recent work36,52 suggesting that miRNAs contribute to the gene expression environment of
status epilepticus.
Although the mechanism by which miRNAs function
differs from RNA interference, miRNAs have nevertheless
been reported to directly reduce mRNA levels in cells.53
Given that mRNAs for hundreds of protein-coding genes
are reduced in epileptic tolerance relative to status epilepticus alone,8 one prediction for the present study
would have been to see greatly increased miRNA expression in tolerant animals. This was not found, however.
Instead, the differential miRNA regulation in epileptic tolerance was mainly a block of the up-regulation of miRNAs
after status epilepticus in combination with down-regulation
of a set of miRNAs not ordinarily regulated after status
epilepticus alone. Thus, the miRNA transcriptome of epileptic tolerance is most characterized by a suppression

2530
Jimenez-Mateos et al
AJP November 2011, Vol. 179, No. 5

of the normal regulated responses of miRNAs after status
epilepticus.
Our immunoblotting results suggest that changes to
miRNA biogenesis components are not responsible for
the miRNA profile in epileptic tolerance. A necessary next
step is to identify the mRNA targets targeted by miRNA
changes in tolerance. This is not straightforward, and it is
generally inappropriate to use exclusively bioinformatics
tools predicting mRNA targets of miRNAs to identify the
pathways affected and assert functional consequences,
as has been reported,52 without direct experimental validation that a particular miRNA can target an mRNA and
alter translation.31 The identification and experimental
validation of the mRNA targets of the tolerance-regulated
miRNAs will enable full evaluation of their potential as
effectors of the neuroprotection.
How does the profile in epileptic tolerance compare to
that of ischemic tolerance? Reduction of miRNA regulation is found after stroke in ischemic preconditioned
mice,11 whereas differential up-regulation of miRNAs, reported to be instigated by ischemic preconditioning,9 –11
was not a feature of epileptic tolerance. Does a set of
miRNAs appear in common across these different models of tolerance? This might be expected, because there
is crossover between categories of genes in ischemic
and epileptic tolerance, including transport genes.6,8
There are miRNAs down-regulated in both epileptic tolerance and ischemic tolerance, including miR-330 and
miR-497. However, these are also down-regulated after
status epilepticus alone, suggesting that they could not
as such account for tolerance. In fact, only miR-27a appears to be regulated in the same direction in both epileptic and ischemic tolerance, with the direction opposite
from its response to injury (Lusardi et al11 and present
study). However, the absence of changes in RNA-induced silencing complex uptake of miR-27a during
Ago-2 analysis casts doubt on a functional influence.
It is notable that some of the mRNA and protein
changes inducing the neuroprotection seen in tolerance
are similar to the alterations that enable cells to evade
apoptosis in cancer, such as increased Bcl-2 and polycomb group protein levels.50,54,55 It is tempting to draw
parallels again between the miRNA changes that characterize tolerance and the frequent, global down-regulation of miRNAs and their biogenesis machinery in many
tumors.56
The present study also provides in vivo evidence that
modulation of a seizure-regulated miRNA can influence
neuropathologic outcome after status epilepticus. miR132 has previously been reported to be expressed in
mouse hippocampus,26,29 which we also confirmed in the
present study using both PCR and in situ hybridization.
We used antagomirs to reduce hippocampal miR-132
levels, thereby modeling the tolerance-induced miR-132
profile. Antagomirs are known to function by complementary binding that leads to non-RNAi-mediated degradation of the miRNA.43 Our present experiments showed
that antagomirs targeting miR-132 profoundly reduce
neuronal death within the CA3 sector after seizures. The
mechanism of this protection is as yet unknown. Known
targets of miR-132 include p250 GTPase-activating pro-

tein,23 and miR-132 can promote dendritic growth and
arborization in response to neuronal activity57 and spine
morphogenesis.26 A small effect of the antagomirs on
seizure duration was noted, although the present and
previous58 analyses of the statistical relationship between seizure time and damage in the model argue
against this accounting for the neuroprotection. More
likely, the neuroprotection relates to changes in cell death
signaling pathways, rather than altered seizure severity.
Of note, at least 5 of the 21 protein-coding genes differentially down-regulated in injury in our previous microarray screen8 have predicted miR-132 binding sites within
their 3=UTR (Adrbk2, Grm7, Ntng1, Slc40a1 and Vgll3;
D.H. and R.S., unpublished observations). The present
study also reveals an unexpected effect of higher doses
of the scrambled antagomir reducing miRNA levels of
both miR-132 and the unrelated miR-92a. This observation, which may be due to off-target effects, underscores
the need for full dose-response evaluation of supposedly
inactive scrambled antagomirs.
Increased expression of miR-132 after status epilepticus alone was also reported after pilocarpine-induced
seizures, in a CREB-dependent manner.21 Thus, findings
on this particular miRNA using the intra-amygdalar KA
model can be extrapolated to other seizure models. Our
data show, however, that miR-132 was not induced in the
CA3 subfield in tolerance mice, nor in the CA1 that is
uninjured after status epilepticus alone. Transcriptional
control of miR-132 can therefore be dissociated from
strong neuronal activity. Moreover, because down-regulation of miR-132 has been implicated in ischemic tolerance by enabling MECP2 protein translation,11 and because CREB has been implicated as an effector of
ischemic tolerance,59,60 our data identify a mechanistic
difference between ischemic and epileptic tolerance. We
also note that miR-132 can have an anti-inflammatory role
by targeting acetylcholinesterase.61 Because inflammation and blood-brain barrier opening have been implicated in ictogenesis and epileptogenesis,62 we cannot
exclude possible favorable effects of elevated miR-132
levels in other seizure models.
Two recent studies have profiled miRNA transcriptional
responses after experimental status epilepticus, but in
each case miRNA was obtained from the entire hippocampus.36,52 This limits interpretation, because of the
well-established transcriptional heterogeneity among
hippocampal subfields.40,63 Indeed, we show that an individual miRNA can display large intersubfield expressional differences in the same model (Figure 5B). It is
perhaps not surprising, therefore, that comparison with
the findings of Liu et al,36 who studied whole hippocampal miRNAs after systemic KA-induced seizures in rats at
24 hours, reveals no miRNAs overlapping with those reported here. We did detect some of the same miRNAs
up-regulated in the study by Hu et al,52 who profiled rats
after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, including
miR-132, miR-375, and miR-199a. These could be common seizure-regulated miRNAs. Indeed, these miRNAs
were either down-regulated or unchanged after ischemia
and subarachnoid hemorrhage.11,36 Again, several miRNAs down-regulated in the study by Hu et al52 were either

miRNAs in Epileptic Tolerance

unchanged in the present study (miR-181c) or showed an
opposite expression pattern (miR-29a, miR-10b, and
miR-21). The present study provides a clean data set on
CA3 subfield responses, one that can serve as a resource to identify a common miRNA signature among
models of status epilepticus. Other strengths of the present study are the use of saline-perfused animals, which
avoids potential contamination of blood miRNA in brain
tissue samples.36,52 Our qPCR-based approach offers
technical advantages over microarray-based profiling in
terms of greater sensitivity and specificity, and in detecting only the biologically active mature form of the miRNA.
In summary, in the present study we have characterized the mouse miRNA response in the CA3 subfield after
status epilepticus evoked by intra-amygdalar KA and
have shown how this is altered in previously preconditioned animals. The observed shift toward miRNA downregulation may be functionally important, and we show
that targeting an injury-only up-regulated miRNA, miR132, protected against seizure-induced neuronal death.
These findings increase our understanding of the role of
miRNAs in the pathogenesis of brain injury and the ability
of a mild preceding seizure event to alter this response
toward a state associated with tissue protection.
