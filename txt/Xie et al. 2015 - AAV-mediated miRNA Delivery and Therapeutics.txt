Abstract
MicroRNAs are 20-24 nt long, single-stranded RNAs that repress gene expression. Dysregulation
of miRNA expression is associated with many human diseases. Modulating the level of
endogenous miRNA alters gene profiling and can achieve therapeutic benefits. Here, we reviewed
currently used methods of altering miRNA activity in vivo. We focus on the delivery of miRNAs
and miRNA inhibitors using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). In general, rAAVmediated miRNA inhibition or overexpression provides a simple, efficient and informative way to
study miRNA function in mammals. This method also provides the opportunity to explore
potential miRNA therapeutics for many diseases.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small 20–24 nt RNAs that repress the expression of mRNAs by
binding to the 3’UTR of the targeted mRNA. As a whole, miRNAs are predicted to regulate
more than half of all mammalian protein-coding genes1. Based on their location in the
genome, the genes that code for miRNA can be categorized into three groups: exonic
miRNAs, intronic miRNAs and miRNAs embedded into protein-coding transcripts2.Most
miRNAs are transcribed as primary miRNA (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II3, though
some are transcribed by RNA polyIII4. A pri-miRNA contains a 7-methylguanosine cap at
its 5′ end and a poly (A) tail at its 3′ end. It is cleaved by an intranuclear ribonuclease III
(RNase III) enzyme, referred to as Drosha, to generate a precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA),
which is a stem-loop molecule approximately 70 nt in length. Subsequently, Exportin-5
binds to the pre-miRNA and transports it into the cytoplasm. It is here that another RNase

miRNA dysregulation in human diseases and miRNA therapeutics

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In 1993, Ambros and his colleagues discovered the first miRNA, Lin-4, in Caenorhabditis
elegans. Since this event, thousands of miRNA have been found and submitted to the
miRNA database (http://www.mirbase.org). These miRNAs have been isolated from
mammals and non-mammals; more than 2500 of which have been isolated from human5.
The correlation between miRNA dysregulation and human disease was first reported by
Calin et al. This pioneering study revealed that the loci for miR-15 and miR-16 were deleted
in the majority of patients suffering from B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia6.
Accumulated data have demonstrated that miRNAs play important roles in almost all classes
of human disease; including cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, etc. For example, more
than 50% of human miRNA-encoding genes are located in chromosomal locations
associated with cancer or fragile sites on a genome-wide base 7. Let-7 is the first miRNA
that was found to regulate the oncogene RAS expression by directly targeting its 3’UTR8.
Further studies have shown that in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) mouse models,
intratumoral injection of synthetically produced let-7 molecular mimics significantly reduces
tumor burden9. In a cohort of 241 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it was
shown that tumor tissues have reduced expression of miR-26 compared with noncancerous
liver tissue from the same patient. Furthermore, in patients whose tumors have decreased
miR-26 expression, lower levels of miR-26 correlate with shorter overall survival10.
Subsequently, systemic delivery of miR-26a via adeno-associated virus vector 8 (AAV8)11,
a vector known for its high liver tropism, dramatically suppresses the tumor progression in a
murine liver cancer model12. In addition to the miRNA studies in cancer, Olson and his
colleagues reported that they had found a signature pattern of miRNAs in cardiac
hypertrophy and heart failure which initiated a wave of research focused on miRNA
function in heart disease13. In a failing heart, miR-21 level is specifically increased in
fibroblasts through the suppression of ERK-MAP kinase signaling pathway which triggers
fibroblast motility and initiates the process of cardiac scarring. Scarring, or fibrosis, of the
heart is an inappropriate physiological response that oftentimes is severely deleterious to the
individual. In vivo silencing of miR-21 by antisense oligonucleotide inhibits interstitial
fibrosis and corrects cardiac dysfunction in a TAC (Transverse aortic constriction) mouse
model14. Genetic knockout (KO) of the cardiac-specific miRNA, miR-208a, can prevent
pathological cardiac remodeling. Similarly, the anti-miR-208a oligonucleotide improved
cardiac function and survival in a rat hypertension-induced heart failure model15,16. Another
study found that mice who received anti-miR-208a oligonucleotide therapy confer resistance
to diet-induced obesity and improved insulin responsiveness17. MiRNAs are also associated
with metabolic diseases. MiR-375 is highly expressed in pancreatic islets and miR-375 KO
mice are hyperglycemic18. MiR-33, an intronic miRNA located in the intron of SREBF-2
gene, cooperates with its SREBF-2 host gene to control cholesterol homeostasis19.
Moreover, administration of anti-miR-33 oligonucleotide raises the plasma HDL level and

represses the atherosclerosis in a hypercholesterolemia mouse model20. Using a similar
approach, inhibition of the miR-33 family in non-human primates also raised plasma HDL
and lower VLDL triglyceride levels21. MiR-122 antagomiR could be the first miRNA-target
drug to treat human disease. MiR-122 is liver specific and highly expressed, constituting
70% of the total liver miRNA population22. The binding between miR-122 and the
conserved 5’ untranslated region of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome protects the HCV
from nucleolytic degradation and host innate immune response23,24. HCV load was
dramatically reduced with the therapeutic use of miR-122 antagomiR to competitively bind
endogenous miR-122. The clinical trial using miR-122 antagomiR to treat HCV patients has
completed the Phase 2a stage, showing prolonged dose-dependent reductions in HCV RNA
levels without evidence of viral resistance 25. All of these researches prove that modulation
of miRNA is providing a new route of treatment against human diseases.

Strategies to investigate miRNA function in vivo

Author Manuscript

Though thousands of miRNAs have been discovered, few miRNA-target interactions have
been experimentally validated, especially in vivo. To understand the complete spectrum of
miRNA function, we need approaches to modulate miRNA activities in order to perform
gain-and-loss of function studies. Genetic disruption of a miRNA gene provides a powerful
strategy to study miRNA function, but many miRNAs share the same seed sequence, the 6–
8 nt miRNA region that defines the target repertoire of a miRNA. Consequently, one
member of a miRNA family may compensate for loss of another. Creating an animal model
in which all members of a miRNA family are deleted is time consuming and expensive. In
some cases, miRNA genetic ablation in mice are embryologically lethal, such as miR-17-19
cluster KO leads to 100% postnatal death with cardiac and lung defects26 and miR-126 KO
results in around 50% embryonic death due to vascular ruptures and subsequent
hemorrhage27.
Chemically modified miRNA mimics or anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMOs)
complementary to mature miRNAs can be used to increase or decrease the activities of
miRNAs respectively, in vitro and in vivo. Though effective, these oligonucleotides
therapies are typically expensive and/or require proprietary modifications such as 2′-Omethyl, 2′-O-methoxyethyl, or 2′, 4′-methylene (LNA)28-30. Unfortunately, due to their
transient lifespan of miRNA mimics and AMOs, treatment requires repeated administration
to effectively express or suppress the cognate miRNAs. Current chemistries and
formulations are limited in their success by the delivery of oligonucleotides to many tissues
or organs, such as pancreas, muscle and brain.

Author Manuscript

An additional strategy to lower miRNA activities is to use transcribed miRNA inhibitors
referred to as miRNA “sponges”31 and “tough decoy RNAs (TuD RNAs)”32. The first
alternative to AMOs are “sponges,” which are miRNA inhibitors that can be expressed in
cells (Fig. 1a). They oftentimes contain multiple binding sites for a specific miRNA of
interest and soak up endogenous miRNA like “sponges”31. To further improve the miRNA
inhibition efficacy, Hideo IBA and his colleagues invented a more potent miRNA inhibitor
known as TuD RNA (Fig. 1b). They did this by replacing the Pol II promoter in the
“sponge” with the more robust Pol III promoter. Additionally, they optimized the secondary

structures and the sequence of the miRNA-binding site32. Depletion of miR-223 using a
sponge-expressing lentiviral vector to stably modify hematopoietic stem cells ex vivo,
followed by bone marrow reconstitution in mice, produced a phenotype similar to that
observed in a genetic miRNA knockout mouse33. This work successfully demonstrated that
viral-vector delivered miRNA inhibitors can functionally knock down miRNAs in mice.
However, the use of lentiviral vector-based miRNA inhibition for functional genomic
studies and human therapy is limited due to the risk of insertional mutagenesis and the
requirement for ex vivo manipulation. To create an efficient and simple way to study
miRNA function in mice, Gao and his colleagues combined rAAV9 vector, which exhibits
high tropism for mouse liver and heart11 with miRNA TuDs to inhibit specific miRNAs.
One single dose of rAAV9 expressing anti-miR-122 or anti-let-7 TuD depleted the
corresponding miRNA and thereby increased the expression of its mRNA targets in the liver
and heart of adult mice. This miRNA inhibition lasted through the 25 weeks of monitoring
without adverse side effects or any drop in efficacy overtime. High throughput sequencing
of liver miRNAs from the treated mice demonstrated that the targeted miRNAs, but no other
miRNAs, were depleted 34, indicating the specificity of target miRNA inhibition. Thus
rAAV-mediated miRNA modulation is holding great promise on miRNA function study in
vivo and potential therapeutics.

RAAV vector: a powerful in vivo gene delivery platform

Author Manuscript

The first human AAV (i.e. AAV serotype 2) was found as a contaminant of adenovirus
preparation. Although 80-90% of the human population is AAV seropositive, infection has
not been associated with any human disease. The wild-type AAV (wtAAV) contains a small
non-enveloped capsid with a diameter of 26 nm and a 4.7 kb single-stranded (ss) genome.
This genome contains two 145-nt inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) at each end and two open
reading frames (ORF; Rep and Cap). The ITRs form two T-shaped structures at each end of
the genome and contribute to AAV genome replication, packaging, integration and rescue
from host genome 35,36. The Rep gene is involved in viral genome replication and
encapsidation during AAV replication 37,38in the presence of a helper virus, such as
adenovirus39 and herpes simplex virus40. The cap ORF provides structural proteins for the
viral capsid which determine the tissue tropism and immune biology in viral infection41.

Author Manuscript

AAV can transduce dividing and non-dividing cells without causing known pathogenic
consequence, which has made it a popular in vivo gene delivery tool. Long-term transgene
expression is the major advantage of AAV vectors42. So far there are 12 AAV serotypes and
more than 100 variants available to transfer foreign genes into the liver, pancreas, heart,
lung, skeletal muscle and CNS efficiently43. The major barrier of translating AAV into
human clinical trials is the host immune response which is relatively low however persistent
though out preclinical models and clinical trials44, even though the immune responses to
AAV vectors in mice is minimal.
A modified AAV, referred to as recombinant AAV (rAAV), which is made by taking the
most useful aspects that wtAAV has to offer and removing the rest, has become the standard
AAV vector. RAAV is designed using wtAAV as a template, but it is crafted brilliantly so
that it is castrated, less risky and more predictable to work with. Though the two ITRs from

the wild-type AAV remain in place, the original Rep and Cap genes of wtAAV are
completely removed and are replaced with genes of interest45. WtAAV can integrate into the
chromosome 19q13 in cultured human cell lines 46,47, but unlike wtAAV, rAAV genomes,
due to their incapability to produce rep, do not integrate into this specific chromosomal site
in cultured cells or infected mammals. Most rAAV genomes persist as episomes in cells48.
Less than 0.1 to 0.5% of the genome randomly integrates into the host genome of mice and
humans49-51. Currently rAAVs are used in many human gene therapy clinical trials, such as
cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson’s, hemophilia B, and Leber’s congenital
amaurosis44. The first rAAV-based commercial drug, Glybera, has been approved to treat
lipoprotein lipase deficiency in Europe 52. RAAV vectors are regarded as the most efficient,
long-lasting and safe somatic gene transfer vehicle in vivo.

therapeutics

Though rAAV vectors have many advantages in in vivo gene delivery comparing with other
viral vectors, the small size of AAV genome (< 4.7 kb) limits its applications on large gene
replacement. Furthermore, to improve the in vivo efficacy of rAAVs transduction, the
capability of rAAV genome is shortened even more to create what is known as selfcomplimentary rAAV vectors (scAAV). These vectors are essentially constructed by
mutating one ITR. The mutated ITR is lack of the terminal resolution site for Rep
endonuclease nicking during virus genome replication and enable continuing the synthesis
of second strand. The failure of Rep nicking the mutated ITR generated two complimentary
single stranded AAV genome and folds upon itself upon uncoating, creating a double
stranded genome which is transcriptionally active in cells. When the virus genome released
from scAAV vector in host cells, it bypasses the conversion of single-stranded genome to
double-stranded genome to make the transgene expression more rapidly and efficiently. This
optimization greatly enhanced the transduction efficacy of AAV in vivo 53,54. This mutation
further reduces the AAV package capability to 2.5 kb. However, the small size of
transcribed miRNA inhibitors (sponges < 0.2 kb; TuD RNAs including Pol III promoter<
0.5 kb) is well suited to scAAV delivery.

Author Manuscript

Based on the scAAV vectors, we can generate a library of rAAV vectors expressing miRNA
inhibitors as well as companion vectors, over-expressing the corresponding miRNA. This
toolkit will enable researchers to test the phenotypic effects of gain-or-loss of function in
vivo. Before murine model study, these constructs can be validated in HEK 293 cells. Each
miRNA toolkit contains 3 components: miRNA sensor plasmid, miRNA over-expression
plasmid and miRNA inhibitor plasmid. The miRNA sensor plasmid is used to monitor the
miRNA activity in cells. It contains two reporter genes. One reporter gene carries multiple
sites complementary to miRNA, which allows the binding of cognate miRNA to abolish the
reporter gene expression. The more miRNA in the target cells, the lower the expression of
the reporter gene can be detected. The other reporter gene is served as a transfection control
(Fig. 2a).
In the standard practice of production of mature miRNAs, researchers integrate the primiRNA fragments into the 3’UTR of transgene or into the intron before the transgene (Fig.

2b).Basically, pri-miRNA fragments are isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from
genomic DNA. The amplicons include the pre-miRNA and ~ 100 bp flanking sequence at
both ends (Fig. 2b). We do not recommend embedding pri-miRNA fragments into the
3’UTR because the co-transcribed pri-miRNA will be processed by Drosha, resulting in the
loss of reporter gene poly (A) and the consequent loss of its expression (Xie, et al.,
unpublished data).
In addition, the pri-miRNA fragments with the same design can be harbored by lentiviral
vectors to suppress the development of non-small cell lung tumor by expressing the let-7
family 55or used to reduce hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis by expressing miR-30c56.

Author Manuscript

We prefer the TuD RNAs in the miRNA inhibitor constructs because of their supremacy in
potency among currently available plasmid-based miRNA inhibitors (Fig. 2c)34,57. In brief,
miRNA over-expression constructs will be co-transfected with the corresponding miRNA
sensor plasmid into HEK293 cells. The reduction of reporter gene will reflect the level of
functional miRNA produced by both 293 cells endogenously and the miRNA overexpression construct. In the presence of miRNA inhibitor in the transfected HEK293 cells,
the reemergence of reporter gene activity indicates the repression of miRNA activity. This is
a result illustrating the repression of reporter gene from construct expressing miRNA (Fig.
2d top) and de-repression of reporter gene from miRNA inhibitor in the presence of ectopic
miRNA (Fig. 2d bottom). Theoretically this strategy is able to cross-validate all the miRNA
expression and inhibition constructs in HEK293 cells. For in vivo studies, in vitro validated
miRNA expression and inhibition constructs can be packaged into different serotypes of
AAV vectors by the conventional “ triple-transfection” method58. In brief, validated rAAV
plasmid (Fig, 2 b and c), packaging plasmid which contains Rep and Cap genes, and
adenovirus helper plasmid were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. After 2-3 days, cells were
harvested for vector purification by ultracentrifugation on CsCl or iodixanol gradient and
column chromatography59,60. In the packaging process, the vector genome flanked with 2
ITRs will be excised from the rAAV vector plasmid, replicated and packaged into AAV
virions. Rep and Cap proteins expressed from the packaging plasmid and the adenovirus
helper plasmid provides helper functions essential for rAAV rescue, replication and
packaging. The serotype of AAV capsid determines tissue tropism, efficiency of
transduction and immune biology of a rAAV vector.

Author Manuscript

In vivo delivery of ectopic miRNAs or their inhibitors is essential for the study of miRNA
functional genomics and therapeutics. As we reviewed above, the advantages of tissue
specific tropism, long-term expression and high transduction efficacy make AAV vectors
ideal in vivo gene delivery tools. Even the TuD RNA expression driven by Pol III promoter
cannot be regulated. By choosing different AAV serotype and by modifying the route of
vector administration, manipulation of miRNA levels in target tissues can be achieved
(Table 1).
Overall the combination of rAAV, a highly efficient in vivo gene delivery vehicle with
optimized miRNA expression cassettes or inhibitors, will be valuable tools for miRNA
functional genomic study and potential therapeutics.

RAAV-mediated miRNA Delivery and miRNA Therapeutics: case studies
The first remarkable breakthrough in miRNA-based therapy is using AAV vector delivered
miR-26a to suppress liver cancer in an inducible-cMYC mouse model12. In the study, Kota
et al found that miR-26a was the most down-regulated miRNA in the liver tumor resulting
from the specific activation of cMYC oncogene in hepatocytes. They then built a scAAV
construct carrying the pri-miR-26a fragment and packaged it into AAV8 vector, an AAV
serotype so efficient in hepatic transfection that it can transduce nearly every hepatocyte in
an individual mouse. After a single tail vein injection, there was a dramatic decrease of
tumor burden, induced by a massive tumor-cell specific apoptosis. By putting back one
miRNA into tumor cells, Kota et al achieved noticeable therapeutic benefit, leading the way
in a novel and exciting therapeutic strategy for the treatment of liver cancer and the other
diseases.

Another successful example of rAAV delivered miRNA therapy was accomplished through
the use of rAAV9, which can cross blood brain barrier 61-63 . RAAV9 was used to deliver
miR-196a to treat spinal-bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) 64. In this study, the authors
compared the miRNA expression profile in the spinal cords of the diseased mice with those
of wild type mice and found that miR-196a, along with 4 other miRNAs, were up-regulated
more than two-fold during the advanced stage of this mouse model disease. The researchers
found evidence that miR-196a was up-regulated in the diseased mice as a protective
mechanism against the progression of the disease and decided that they would attempt to
treat the disease by aiding the natural up-regulation of miR-196a by bolstering the amount of
this miRNA with a delivery of exogenous miR-196a. After miR-196a was successfully
delivered via rAAV9, they found the disease related gene expression was down-regulated,
resulting in the improvement of not only mouse behavior but of body weight and mouse
survival. The benefit from miR-196a over-expression also indicates endogenous miRNAs
can be protective factors in the disease progress.

Author Manuscript

To understand the function of nearly 300 conserved miRNAs between humans and mice, we
can continue to develop the field by producing hundreds of miRNA-KO mouse strains for
future research or we can produce mouse miRNA toolkits as described above, applicable
and adaptive for use in many animal and cell models. To accelerate analysis of miRNA
function in mammals, Xie, et al., achieved similar phenotypes as miR-122 KO mice 65,66 by
combining the advantages of rAAV vectors and TuD RNAs 34. Using the same approach,
AAV delivered anti-miR-26a TuD delays the differentiation from myoblasts to myotubes67.
It is likely that the desired results from the development of miRNA somatic KO mice can be
obtained more quickly and easily by means of scAAV-delivered TuDs. There is also much
to be learned from the up-regulation of miRNA; a goal that is difficult to be addressed by the
creation of transgenic overexpression mouse libraries, but can be quite robustly
accomplished with the construction of scAAV-delivered pri-miRNAs with a single bonus of
rAAV injection.

Prospects and challenges

Author Manuscript

Over the past few years, miRNA-based therapeutics have achieved great success in many
preclinical animal models, such as HCV29, HCC12, metabolic disorders21,56, and
cardiovascular disease68. The first miRNA-targeted drug, miravirsen (miR-122 antisense
oligonucleotide), completed its Phase 2a study recently25. The clinical data showed the
patients were well tolerated, 2 to 3 logs reduction of HCV RNA and no signs of viral
resistance. Miravirsen provides an additional option for the patients who are not responding
to interferon therapy and avoids virus mutation because it targets the host gene miR-122 on
which the virus relies, not on the virus itself. The clinical results are very attractive, but there
are still concerns about the long term safety of miR-122 inhibition in patients. Every single
miRNA regulates hundreds of target genes involved in multiple pathways. Modulation of
miRNA may easily lead to unwanted outcomes. Indeed, miR-122 inhibition by AMOs or
scAAV-delivered TuDs lowered high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) simultaneously28-30,34. However HDL is regarded as good cholesterol. The most
severe concern is the correlation between low miR-122 level and HCC development in
patients, although no direct causal link has been established 69-71. Furthermore, aged
miR-122 KO mice developed HCC 65,66. This germ line depletion of miR-122 may not
accurately reflect the real risk of liver cancer in adult HCV patients who only lose miR-122
during the miR-122 antisense oligonucleotide treatment, but it does warn of potential
threats. AAV vector expression is stable for years in mice and humans. AAV delivered antimiR-122 TuD may be used to evaluate the HCC risk of long-term miR-122 inhibition and
other side effects.

Author Manuscript

MiR-26a based liver cancer therapy also confronts the same concern. AAV8 delivered
miR-26a can result in tumor suppression in the mouse liver cancer model driven by cMYC
gene12, but miR-26a also promotes cholangiocarcinoma growth by activating β-catenin72.
The activation of Wnt/β-catenin is one of the major pathways involved in HCC73. In glioma,
miR-26 was also reported as an oncomiR (miRNA associated with cancer) by directly
repressing a well-known tumor suppressor74, PTEN. It is a legitimate concern that bolstering
levels of miR-26a may worsen the pathogenesis in certain populations of HCC patients.

Author Manuscript

High unregulated expression of shRNAs delivered by rAAV has been reported to saturate
endogenous cellular miRNA machinery and cause fatal effects in mice75,76. A surplus of
rAAV-delivered shRNAs diminishes two crucial RNAi machineries, Exportin-5 and
Argonaut-2 protein 76,77. To improve the safety, shRNAs were engineered into the position
where the mature miRNA duplex is and flanked with native sequence to direct correct
processing. By producing less unprocessed precursors and by increasing the effectiveness of
processing, this procedure optimization reduced shRNA-mediated toxicity delivered by
AAV in the CNS 78,79. However, this strategy also raised another risk from possibly
disturbing another important RNAi machinery factor, Drosha, which is required for the
miRNA shuttle strategy. In rAAV mediated miRNA replacement or enforcement, the impact
of ectopic miRNAs on RNAi machinery and homeostasis of endogenous miRNAs as well as
the off-target effects in targeted tissue and unwanted tissues have not been addressed. On the
other hand, AAV delivered TuD RNA has demonstrated efficacy, specificity and safety of

miRNA inhibition 34, but extensive studies particularly in large animal models are still
required.
Overall miRNA therapeutics is an emerging field filled with lots of hope. Because of their
roles as master regulators in many diseases, miRNAs can achieve previously unreachable
medical benefit when compared with conventional mono-target therapeutics. Targeting of
multiple genes is the strength of using miRNAs and miRNA inhibitors as therapeutics
reagents, but the unique property is also its weakness. Without thoroughly understanding the
miRNA functions, miRNA-based therapeutics will be double-edged swords in many cases.
