Hormones and neurotransmitters rapidly change patterns of gene
expression in target cells by activating protein kinases that phosphorylate and modify the activity of CREB and other transcription
factors. Although CREB was initially characterized as mediating the
response to cAMP, CREB phosphorylation and activation are stimulated by diverse extracellular signals and protein kinases in
essentially all cells and tissues. CREB stimulates transcription
through a constitutive activation domain (CAD), which interacts
with the promoter recognition factor TFIID, and through a kinaseinducible domain (KID), when Ser-133 is phosphorylated. The
present study provides new insight into the mechanism of activation by showing that each of the CREB domains contributes to
transcription initiation by stimulating sequential steps in the transcription reaction. The CAD effectively assembled a polymerase
complex, as evidenced by constitutive activation in vivo and stimulation of single-round transcription in vitro. In contrast, phosphorylation of the KID in CREB stimulated isomerization of the
polymerase complex, as determined by abortive initiation, and
promoter clearance and兾or reinitiation, as measured by multiple
rounds of transcription. Our results provide evidence for a new
model for CREB-mediated induction through a concerted mechanism involving establishment of a polymerase complex by the CAD,
followed by stimulation of isomerization, promoter clearance,
and兾or reinitiation by phosphorylated KID to enhance target gene
transcription.

I

mportant features of kinase-inducible gene regulation are that
many of the target genes exhibit basal expression and the
response to kinase activation is extremely rapid, occurring within
minutes (1, 2). CREB was first described as a transcription factor
mediating induction by extracellular signals activating adenylate
cyclase and protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates
Ser-133 in CREB and enhances its transcriptional activity (3).
Subsequently, several other signaling pathways were demonstrated to activate protein kinases that phosphorylate Ser-133
and enhance transcription of cAMP response element (CRE)containing genes in a variety of cells and tissues (calmodulin
kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase兾p90rsk, protein kinase
C, p38, and protein kinase B (PKB兾Akt) (4, 5).
For any gene to be transcribed, there must be recruitment
of a polymerase complex, isomerization to expose the template
strand, and promoter clearance of the polymerase to transcribe
the body of the gene (6). Previous studies, based on the binding
of heterogeneous activating transcription factor (ATF)兾CREB
proteins to CRE sites, have produced conf licting results
(7–12). Early studies using footprinting demonstrated that the
presence of an ATF兾CRE site in a promoter produced an
extended footprint, caused by a complex containing RNA
polymerase II and TFIIB, TFIID, and TFIIE (7, 8). We
previously showed that stimulation of in vitro transcription by
cAMP-activatable PKA required a CRE site in the template
and could be inhibited by a PKA-specific inhibitor peptide or
by the addition of phosphatase but PKA did not affect binding
of CREB (12). Additional in vitro transcription studies by
others suggested that factors associated with ATF兾CRE sites

could promote any (7, 9, 10) or all (11) of the steps in
transcription initiation in response to cAMP. However, interpretation of these studies is limited by the possible complication that PKA phosphorylates and changes the activity of other
proteins in the nuclear extracts.
The CREB protein contains two distinct activation domains, a
constitutive activation domain (CAD) and a kinase-inducible domain (KID) that can act independently to facilitate either constitutive or kinase-inducible transcription activation (13, 14). The
CAD in CREB interacts with the hTAF130兾dTAF110 subunit of
TFIID, which may facilitate recruitment of a polymerase complex
assembly (15, 16) (E. Felinski, J.K., L.J., and P.G.Q., unpublished
work). We mapped the interaction between the TATA-binding
protein (TBP)-associated factor (TAF) and CREB to hydrophobic
residues in the CREB CAD (15). Subsequent work showed that
these mutations also abolish (i) interaction between the proteins in
vitro, (ii) recruitment of a polymerase-containing complex, and (iii)
transcription activation in transfection studies, thereby providing a
genetic link between interaction, recruitment, and transcription
activation (E. Felinski and P.G.Q., unpublished work). An analogous mechanism is used to stimulate transcription activation by
other constitutively active factors (17–20) and ligand-inducible
nuclear receptors (21, 22).
Phosphorylation of CREB on Ser-133 has been demonstrated to promote association with CREB-binding protein
(CBP). Bacterially expressed CREB binds CBP in a strictly
phosphorylation-dependent manner and overexpression of
CBP augmented induction of a somatostatin reporter by
CREB in F9 cells (23). In that study, CBP also bound TFIIB,
suggesting that it enhances activation through recruitment of
essential components of the polymerase complex. In another
study, CBP binding to CREB was reported in the absence of
CREB phosphorylation (24). More recently, phosphorylated
CREB was shown to interact with RNA polymerase complexes
in HeLa cell nuclear extracts, an effect that could be blocked
with a CBP peptide that bound CREB or antibody against
RNA helicase A (25, 26). It was proposed that phosphorylated
CREB activates transcription through interaction with CBP
and recruitment of RNA polymerase II complexes. However,
the assays used in that study did not assess the contribution of
CREB phosphorylation to discrete steps in transcription initiation. Phosphorylated CREB would have to interact with the
polymerase complex to have an effect on transcription,
whether at the recruitment step or at later steps, e.g., isomerization, promoter clearance, or reinitiation.

In the present study, we used assays for discrete steps in transcription initiation to determine the separate and combined contributions of the CREB-activation domains, CAD and KID, to
regulation of these different steps in transcription activation. Either
or both of the CREB-activation domains were linked to the Gal4
DNA-binding domain in fusion proteins that were used to assess
transcription activation in vivo and in vitro. We directly examined
the contributions of these activation domains to recruitment,
isomerization, or promoter clearance兾reinitiation with singleround transcription, abortive initiation, or multiple-round in vitro
transcription assays, respectively. We show that the CAD in CREB
mediated assembly of a polymerase complex, a process that was
unaffected by phosphorylation of KID. In contrast, the KID in
CREB, but not the CAD, enhanced isomerization and multipleround transcription in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Although polymerase complex assembly by the CAD was not influenced by phosphorylation of KID, CAD-mediated assembly was
required to observe enhancement of subsequent steps, indicating
that the functions of these domains are integrated to provide
maximal stimulation of the transcription initiation reaction in
response to activation by protein kinases.

P-KID and P-CRG, after which 0.5 unit of PKA inhibitor was
added to inhibit further PKA activity. Phosphorylation of CRG
proteins by PKA was demonstrated by Western blotting with a
CREB phospho-Ser-133-specific antibody. Rat liver nuclear

described (12), with the following modifications: in vitro reactions contained 50 ␮g of nuclear extract兾150 fmol of template

Template, nuclear extract, and CREB-Gal4 proteins were preincubated for 10 min to allow formation of a preinitiation
complex before the addition of nucleotides. In vitro transcription
reactions were performed for 10 min at 30°C. For single-round
transcription, CTP and UTP were omitted for the initial 2 min
and then added with 0.02% Sarkosyl, which prevents the formation of new preinitiation complexes and the reaction was
continued for 10 min (28). Single- and multiple-round transcription depicted in Figs. 2 and 4 was assayed in parallel in three
experiments, by preincubation of identical aliquots of template,
nuclear extract, and CRG proteins, followed by the addition of
the appropriate NTPs ⫾ Sarkosyl. The mRNA synthesized was
quantitated by primer extension analysis and was corrected for
the relative amount of an internal RNA standard added in the
transcription stop mix. For abortive initiation (29, 30), the

otide substrate and trinucleotide product were separated on a
23% polyacrylamide兾7 M urea gel. The results were normalized
to the activity obtained with G4-DBD. Equivalent results were
obtained for all in vitro assays by using at least two different
preparations of purified proteins and nuclear extracts.
Results
The activity of CREB-Gal4 fusion proteins, containing either
(CAD-G4 or KID-G4) or both (CRG) of the CREB-activation
domains (Fig. 1a), was assessed in transfected cells (Fig. 1b) with
a minimal promoter under the control of five Gal4 sites (5XGT).
The activity of 5XGT-Luc in the presence of G4-DBD is
significantly greater than in mock-transfected cells, indicating
that polymerase complexes do form at a low rate on the minimal
promoter in the absence of activators. CAD-G4 or unphosphorylated CRG stimulated constitutive activity of the 5XGT promoter, but did not mediate induction by PKA (Fig. 1b). We and
others have previously shown that unphosphorylated CRG and
CRG-S133A are equally effective in promoting basal activity in
transfected cells (13, 14). In contrast, cotransfection of the
catalytic subunit of PKA with CRG or KID-G4 stimulated
expression. The overall level of transcription induced by KID-G4
was reduced considerably and probably reflects stimulation of
polymerase complexes that form in the absence of active recruitment. These results suggested that the two domains in
CREB may affect different processes in transcription initiation,
but analysis of this hypothesis required the establishment of an
in vitro system in which the activities of these domains could be
measured independently. An in vitro transcription system that
recapitulates the regulation seen in vivo was developed by
employing a Gal4-dependent promoter (5XGT), recombinant
CREB-Gal4 fusion proteins (CAD-G4, KID-G4, and CRG)
purified from Sf9 insect cells, and rat liver nuclear extracts
containing RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors.
As in vivo, induction of in vitro transcription was dependent on
phosphorylation of CREB Ser-133 (CRG vs. CRG-S133A; Fig.
1c). Phosphorylation of the purified recombinant proteins was
demonstrated by incubation with PKA and analysis of aliquots
on parallel blots probed with antibody for CREB (Fig. 1d Upper)
or phospho-Ser-133-CREB (Fig. 1d Lower). In vitro phosphorylation by PKA was specific for Ser-133 in CREB. Similar blots

showed that phosphorylation of CRG兾KID was maintained
throughout the course of these assays (data not shown).
To determine whether the CAD and兾or KID could stimulate
assembly of a polymerase complex, we measured single-round
transcription, which reflects primarily recruitment (Fig. 2). The
template was preincubated with nuclear extract and recombinant
proteins for 10 min to allow the formation of preinitiation complexes. Then, two of the four nucleotides required for transcription
were added for 2 min to allow initiation of transcripts, after which
0.02% Sarkosyl was added to inhibit new complex formation,
together with the remaining nucleotides to allow completion of
transcripts initiated by recruited polymerase complexes (10, 28).
CAD-G4, CRG, or CRG-S133A were equally effective in recruiting
a polymerase complex to the promoter and stimulating transcript
synthesis. On the other hand, KID-G4 did not promote detectable
recruitment of a polymerase complex in this assay, regardless of its
phosphorylation state. Thus, the CAD in CREB is sufficient to
recruit a polymerase complex. Although the KID can interact with
CBP and the polymerase complex in a phosphorylation-dependent
manner, this interaction does not necessarily contribute to recruitment, as had been suggested (23, 25, 26, 31). Rather, these data
suggest that phosphorylated CREB may stimulate a later step in the
transcription initiation pathway.
After recruitment, the RNA polymerase II complex undergoes
an isomerization reaction, in which the promoter is melted to
expose the template strand to the polymerase. The extent of this
reaction can be measured by quantifying abortive initiation, i.e., the
ability of the polymerase to catalyze addition of a nucleotide to a
dinucleotide substrate complementary to the initiation site, which
requires that the promoter be melted to expose the template strand
(29, 30). The CAD-G4 and CRG proteins increased abortive
initiation only modestly over the nonspecific background level
provided by nuclear extract (Fig. 3 a and b), consistent with their
ability to establish low-level basal transcription in vivo. In contrast,
phosphorylation of CRG greatly enhanced the extent of abortive
initiation, consistent with its ability to stimulate inducibility by PKA.
Interestingly, phospho-KID-G4 alone stimulated abortive initiation
poorly, which probably reflects its inability to recruit a polymerase
complex (Fig. 2b). However, stimulation by CRG is greater because

nuclear extract, and CREB-Gal4 proteins.

the CAD in CRG has recruited polymerase complexes, the isomerization of which can then be stimulated by phosphorylation of the
KID in CRG.
After recruitment and isomerization, the polymerase needs to
break free of the preinitiation complex in a step referred to as
promoter clearance, so that it can transcribe the body of the gene.
Of the general transcription factors required to form the preinitiation complex, only TFIIF remains associated with the elongating
polymerase (6, 32). On the other hand, it is likely that some factors,
such as TFIID, TFIIB, and TFIIA, remain associated with the
template and may promote reinitiation of the polymerase (33, 34).
To determine the contributions of the CREB activation domains to
promoter clearance and reinitiation, we measured multiple-round
transcription, which reflects the summation of all steps in the
transcription reaction (Fig. 4). The experiments shown in Figs. 2
and 4 were done in parallel with the same template, nuclear extract,
and CREB-Gal4 proteins to allow direct comparison between the
single- and multiple-round assays. CRG or CRG-S133A were more
effective than CAD-G4 in stimulating multiple rounds of transcription, which is consistent with their greater effect in promoting
constitutive activation in vivo (Fig. 1b). KID-G4 was ineffective in
promoting multiple-round in vitro transcription, whether phosphorylated or not, probably as a result of its inability to recruit a complex
in this assay (Fig. 2). In contrast, phosphorylated CRG stimulated
multiple rounds of transcription (Fig. 4 a and b), consistent with
Kim et al.

Discussion
The data presented here provide significant new insight into the
mechanism of transcription activation used by phosphorylated
CREB. Our results confirm and extend previous studies on the role
of the CREB CAD in recruiting TFIID and a RNA polymerase
complex to the targeted promoter. More importantly, our data
provide new evidence for additional roles of phosphorylated CREB
in promoting later steps in transcription activation. Thus, a revised
model for the stimulation of transcription activation by phosphorylated CREB is proposed to involve recruitment of TFIID and the
polymerase complex by the CAD, followed by stimulation of
isomerization and promoter clearance and兾or reinitiation by phosphorylation of the KID in CREB.
Previous work showed that the CAD in CREB can interact with
TFIID (35), through association with hTAF130兾dTAF110 (15, 16).
A similar mechanism is involved in activation of transcription by
other factors (17–22). In particular, disruption of the interaction
between Sp1 and TAF130 disrupts transcription activation (16, 19).
We recently showed that the CAD in CREB promotes recruitment
of a complex containing RNA polymerase II, TFIIB, and TBP (E.
Felinski, J.K., J.L., and P.G.Q., unpublished work) and that mutations in the CREB CAD that abolish the CREB-TAF interaction
also abolish both recruitment and transcription activation (E.
Felinski and P.G.Q., unpublished work). Here we show that the
CAD in CRG is sufficient to recruit a polymerase complex and
promote single-round transcription in vitro (Fig. 2). Taken together,
these studies suggest that recruitment of TFIID and the polymerase
complex is not only necessary, but sufficient, for the establishment
of basal transcription by CREB. That idea is consistent with
experiments showing that the association of holoenzyme with a
promoter by a variety of means is sufficient to activate transcription
(36, 37). In particular, our results are in excellent agreement with
a recent report showing that recruitment of TFIID, but not
holoenzyme, was sufficient to activate transcription in mammalian
cells (38). Our results also provide evidence that the activity of the
recruited complex can then be further stimulated by phosphorylation of CREB.
In previous work, Nakajima et al. (25, 31) assessed the ability of
general transcription factors that bound to CREB immobilized on
a column to support transcription activation when supplied with
template and other factors. They found that TFIID was bound by
immobilized CREB, independent of its phosphorylation state, and
that a holoenzyme complex in nuclear extracts bound CREB in a
phosphorylation- and CBP-dependent manner. Binding of both
TFIID and the polymerase complex was required for maximal
effects in the subsequent transcription assay. Those results were
interpreted to indicate that the interactions of the CAD with
hTAF130 and of phospho-CREB with CBP were responsible for
recruiting TFIID and the holoenzyme complex, respectively. However, the experimental design used there would not allow observation of a processive mechanism of recruitment because template
was provided only after protein–protein interaction between CREB
and nuclear extract components (TFIID or holoenzyme fraction).
In addition, phospho-CREB would have to interact with one or
more components of the polymerase complex to affect any step in
transcription initiation. Thus, the association of phospho-CREB
with the polymerase complex does not, by itself, indicate that the
phospho-CREB–CBP interaction regulates recruitment to the template. In our experiments, recruitment was measured in the presence of the template, and we saw that CAD, but not KID, mediated

phosphorylation affecting only the later steps in transcription. We
also estimated the number of cycles of transcription (Fig. 4c) and
found that the P-CRG-mediated increase in the number of
cycles was greater than the extent of stimulation of isomerization by CRG (Fig. 3b). Thus, it seems likely that P-CRG
stimulates promoter clearance and兾or reinitiation, in addition to
isomerization.

roles of the CREB activation domains in transcription activation
provides a basis for why CRE modulator (CREM) family
members with large portions of the CAD spliced out act negatively as competitors (39) and why S133A acts as a dominantnegative factor (40, 41). Most importantly, it provides a mechanistic explanation for how neurotransmitters and hormones can
rapidly increase the rate of transcription of target genes in
response to extracellular signals (4). A well-documented example is cAMP induction of transcription of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene, which is dependent on CREB (27, 42,
43) and occurs within minutes of stimulation of cells with cAMP
(1). In addition, mutation of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase CRE reduced both basal and kinase-inducible transcription of the gene (27, 42, 43). Regulatory regions of the
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter corresponding to
the CRE and TATA box were protected from DNase digestion
independently of stimulation of the cells with cAMP, but only in
cells expressing the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene,
not in cells where it is silent (26, 41–43). Constitutive occupancy
of the CRE and promoter is consistent with the model proposed
here, in which the effect of PKA phosphorylation of CREB is to
change the activity of preexisting polymerase complexes, rather
than promote their recruitment.
In summary, this work, together with previous work (13–15,
26, 31, 35), supports a general model for transcription activation
in which CREB plays a role in regulating several steps in
transcription initiation. CREB is constitutively bound to many
promoters where, in concert with other factors, it will assemble
a polymerase complex. This recruitment activity of the CAD is
responsible for setting the basal activity of the gene and preparing it for responsiveness to external signals. Activation of
protein kinases and phosphorylation of CREB in response to
extracellular signals can then modify the activity of a preassembled polymerase complex by phosphorylating CREB to
enhance isomerization, promoter clearance, and兾or reinitiation
of the polymerase, as shown here, leading to rapid increases in
the transcription of target genes.

polymerase complex assembly. Although our data do not rule out
a role for phospho-CREB-CBP in recruitment of a RNA polymerase complex, they do indicate that it is not essential for kinaseinduced stimulation of transcription. A contribution of phosphoKID to isomerization, promoter clearance, and reinitiation would
not have been evident in the experiments of Nakajima et al. (25).
A consistent feature of studies from both laboratories is the
necessity for recruitment of a TFIID complex by the CAD.
A significant new finding of this study is that our data clearly
show that CREB facilitated postrecruitment steps in the transcription initiation reaction in a strictly phosphorylationdependent manner. Thus, even if phospho-CREB did contribute
to recruitment, its stimulation of later steps, which were less
efficiently stimulated by the CAD, plays an essential role in
promoting maximal transcription activation. Phosphorylation
was required to see a large effect on isomerization or multipleround transcription. There was no effect of phosphorylation on
single-round transcription, indicating that later steps are not rate
limiting under these conditions. In addition, the effect of phosphorylation on abortive initiation was less than the effect on
multiple-round transcription, indicating that promoter clearance
and兾or reinitiation are also regulated. The results of our in vitro
mechanistic studies (Figs. 2–4) correlate very well with the
effects seen with the separate and combined domains of CREB
in transfected cells (Fig. 1b). The ability of CAD-G4 to assemble
a polymerase complex (Fig. 2) sets a basal level well below the
maximal level seen with phosphorylated CRG, consistent with
ineffective stimulation of later steps in the reaction (Figs. 3 and
4). In contrast, basal activity with KID-G4 alone was comparable
to that seen with the inert G4-DBD, but allowed some induction
by PKA in vivo, consistent with stimulation of later steps in the
reaction for the few polymerase complexes that form on the
template in the absence of activator-mediated recruitment.
We hypothesize that recruitment of TFIID by CAD is absolutely required to establish a polymerase complex, whose activity
can then be modified by phospho-KID. A concerted mechanism
of CREB-mediated transcription activation, involving regulation
of sequential steps in the transcription reaction by the CREB
constitutive and kinase-inducible domains, is consistent with
many observations in different biological systems. The distinct
