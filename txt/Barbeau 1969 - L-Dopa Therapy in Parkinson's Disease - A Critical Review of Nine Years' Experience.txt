L-Dopa Therapy in Parkinson's Disease:
A Critical Review of Nine Years' Experience
SUMMARY..The last 10 years have seen great activity in the
investigation of cerebral catecholamines, particular attention having been
paid to dopamine. The low dopamine content in the basal ganglia and in
the urine of patients with Parkinson's disease led to the logical use of
the precursor DOPA in the treatment of this disorder. Between 1961
and 1966, both the oral and the intravenous routes were utilized and
some effects were noted upon akinesia and rigidity. The doses then used
were low and the results remained somewhat controversial. When higher
oral levels of L-dopa were introduced, the beneficial action of L-dopa
upon parkinsonian symptoms and signs was proved beyond doubt, but
there came to light a number of troublesome side effects, the worst of
which were hypotension and a variety of abnormal involuntary movements.
Recently, new approaches to the therapy have been tried and the sum
total of these observations is to challenge our peace of mind regarding a
seemingly logical chain of events. We are convinced that such second
thoughts will eventually result in better and safer methods of treating this
too frequent and disabling neurological disorder.
When James Parkinson described
paralysis agitans in 1817, little did
he suspect that it would take 150
years for an effective treatment to
be found. It is the story of that
therapeutic approach which will be
detailed in the present paper. As re¬
cently as 1958 it could be said
during the first of many symposia
on Parkinson's disease: "In our
opinion the successful surgical inter¬
vention is far more impressive than
any medical degrees of improve¬
ment."1 This statement was based
upon the results with standard anticholinergic and antihistaminic drugs
and was found by Duvoisin2 to be
equally applicable in 1965. How¬
ever, clinical and biochemical
studies reported during the last 12
years make the present situation
very different.
The abnormal metabolism of
catecholamines in Parkinson's dis¬
ease demonstrated simultaneously in
1960 by workers in Austria3 and in
Canada46 was the consequence of
earlier postulates and investigations
by Carlsson and his co-workers7'8
and by Everett and Toman,9 and led
to the trial of dopamine precursors
in this condition.1^ n This approach
has received a large amount of ex¬

perimental and clinical support and

could be said to be "rational". How¬
ever, some of the basic tenets under¬
lying the apparently logical sequence
of events may have been challenged
by more recent experiments. It
therefore seems appropriate to re¬
view the present state of knowledge
in this field in the light of our own
experience gained from human and
animal experiments over the last
nine years.
RATIONALE FOR THE USE
OF L-DOPA IN PARKINSON'S
DISEASE
For a number of years it had
been known that reserpine can pro¬
duce a parkinsonian syndrome. The
reason for this became clearer when
Bertler and Rosengren12 and Sano
et al.1B demonstrated that nor¬
adrenaline had a characteristic
distribution within the brain differ¬
ent from that of its precursor dopa¬
mine. The latter was found mainly
in the basal ganglia and substantia
nigra while the former was in great¬
est concentration in the hypo¬
thalamus and brain stem. The brain
could be depleted of both by re¬
serpine. This difference in localiza¬

tion, as well as some divergent peri¬
pheral effects,14 led to the postulate

that dopamine could have independ¬
ent physiological functions in the
brain and even at the periphery.
The evidence for this conclusion,
and for the existence of specific
dopamine receptors, has been
thoroughly reviewed by many
authors1520 and will not be repeated
here, except in summary (Table I).
Such overwhelming arguments in
favour of a significant role for
dopamine in the functioning of the

extrapyramidal centres are strengthened by pharmacological experi¬
ments in animals and by observa¬
tions in human parkinsonism:

(a) Pharmacology of dopamine

Reserpine and benzoquinolizine
derivatives mobilize monoamines,
decrease their cerebral concentra¬
tions, particularly that of dopa¬
mine,7'4143 and produce extra¬

pyramidal syndromes. or decreases

the extrapyramidal effects of re¬

tives in animals44
This effect is most likely to be due
to repletion of dopamine, since
direct noradrenaline replacement

through 3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine
is not successful.52

TABLE L.Role of Dopamine in Basal Ganglia

Summary of Evidence

A. DISTRIBUTION
Presence in brain of dopamine.21-23
80% of brain dopamine in corpus striatum.13
Presence of dopamine in other extrapyramidal areas: pallidum,
substantia nigra.7
In striatum, tyrosine is converted mainly to dopamine24 with
little further transformation to noradrenaline as in other areas of
brain,25 despite ample supply of dopamine-0-hydroxylase,26
dopamine and the enzyme being possibly situated in different

compartments.20

B. BIOCHEMISTRY
Presence in basal ganglia of all enzymes necessary for dopamine
synthesis and metabolism: decarboxylase, dopamine-jS-hydro-27
xylase, monoamine-oxidase, catechol-O-methyl transferase.26*
Ptesence in basal ganglia and substantia nigra of metabolic
products of dopamine: methoxytyramine, homovanillic acid

(HVA).2830

C. HISTOCHEMISTRY
Demonstration and mapping out of a nigrostriatal dopaminergic
pathway with fluorescent methods31 and with modified silver
methods (Moore, R. W., unpublished).
Presence of dopamine-containing nerve cells in substantia nigra,
but virtually none in striatum.32
Presence of dopamine-containing nerve terminals of fine calibre
in the striatum33 organized into a closely packed, dense meshwork.

D. NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
Most workers agree that dopamine has an inhibitory effect on
the activity of single neurons in the brain, both in lower animals
and in mammals.15
Stimulation of the substantia nigra and centrum medianum of
thalamus liberates dopamine in the striatum.34' 38
Lesions in the substantia nigra in rats31 and in monkeys35
produce a decrease in dopamine concentration in the ipsilateral
striatum as well as a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase and
dopa-decarboxylase36*37 in the same nuclei.
There is evidence of specific dopamine receptors in the brain39
and in the kidneys.40

Everett and Wiegand63 in studies
carried out from 1958 to 1962
clearly demonstrated not only that
L-dopa corrected some of the
extrapyramidal effects of reserpine,
but that there was also a correlation
between the level of brain catechol¬
amines (particularly dopamine) and
increasing degrees of motor be¬
haviour and aggressiveness in mice.
Seiden and Hanson64 also demon¬
strated the effect of L-dopa on reserpine-induced changes in condi¬
tioned avoidance responses.
Butyrophenones and phenothiazines provoke extrapyramidal syn¬
dromes, and are known to interfere with dopamine receptors
and to act as competitive inhibitors
of the catecholamine membrane

pump.39* 47"61
In all cases (reserpine, butyro¬
phenones, phenothiazines) it would
appear that either receptor blockade
or re-uptake blockade triggers a
compensatory feedback mechanism,
increasing transmitter synthesis and,
consequently, dopamine turnover
within the basal ganglia.

(b) Pharmacology of dopamine

in man
The correlation between some
modification of dopamine metabol¬
ism and extrapyramidal symptomatology is thus clearly established in
animals. Studies of Parkinson's dis¬
ease in humans reinforce this con¬
clusion and are summarized in
Table II.

DOPA IN HUMANS

Dopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenylala-

nine) was first synthesized in 1911
by Casimir Funk, and its L-form
was identified in Vicia faba beans

in 1913 by Guggenheim, who also
was able to demonstrate on himself
its emetic action.15 Following the
demonstration by Carlsson et a/.44
in 1956 of the depleting effect of
the
reserpine upon catecholamines, that
same group was able to show

L-dopa can serve as a reserpine
antagonist42 and abolish some of the
extra-pyramidal effects produced
by this drug. The identification of
dopamine as a component of human
brain by Montagu23 in 1957 and the
further localization of the high con¬

centration of dopamine in the basal
ganglia7 led to the first trial of
L-dopa in humans by Degkwitz and
collaborators45 in 1960. This was
followed by a study in drug-induced
extra-pyramidal disorders by Mc¬
Geer and collaborators84 in 1961,
with negative results.
In 1961, simultaneously and inreported
dependently, two groupsParkinson's
on the use of L-dopa in
disease. In Montreal, Barbeau and
collaborators10*82 using oral L-dopa,
noticed marked but short-lasting
improvement in rigidity and tremor,
while in Vienna, Birkmayer and
Hornykiewicz11 used the intravenous
route and observed changes in
akinesia.

L-DOPA IN PARKINSON'S
DISEASE
Following these initial reports a
great number of papers, reporting
conflicting results and with a wide
variety of approaches, were pub¬
lished. It is sometimes difficult to
follow clearly the trend in these
early years, except to note that al¬

concluded that the changes observed
were barely more than a placebo
response.
Our own experience from 1960
to 1968 was with oral L-dopa given
in doses of between 300 and 2000
mg. per day to a total of 43 pa¬

tients. Because of cost limitations
61

the patients never received the drug
for more than a few days at a time.
Two of the first patients were given
300 mg. daily over a period of
three months.10 In 34 of these pa¬
tients a favourable effect from ldopa administration was observed
and measured. The duration of its
maximum effect varied between two
to four hours (for a single dose)
and three to four days after ces¬
sation of L-dopa at 300-600 mg./
day. The improvement was mainly
in rigidity and tremor.
In the summer of 1966, despite
some trials with occasional high
doses of oral D,L-dopa by a few
authors, the general impression was
that dopa had definite effects on
the symptoms of rigidity and aki¬
nesia, but that its therapeutic use¬
fulness was still to be demonstrated.
The lessons and conclusions that
prevailed at that time were sum¬
marized by us in a lecture in June
1966 and are listed in Table IV.
In August 1966, at the Brookhaven National Laboratories, Cotzias and his co-workers had the
courage to increase the dose of oral
D,L-dopa gradually to levels be¬
tween 3 and 16 g. per day. In 1967
they reported on 16 parkinsonian
patients so treated, with "a striking
sustained improvement in several
patients".87 Major side effects, par¬

ticularly hematologic complications,
developed in some patients and pre¬
sented a problem in continuation of
therapy. Shortly afterwards, at the
Second International Congress of
Neuro-Genetics in Montreal,88 the
same authors indicated that they
were then using L-dopa on 12 pa¬
tients, five of whom had partici¬
pated in the earlier trial with d,ldopa. Again the preliminary evi¬
dence was that "continuous oral ad¬
ministration of L-dopa may bring
sustained relief to some parkin¬
sonian patients, lasting for the sev¬
eral months of the trial practised
thus far". The results were graphically illustrated on films. Following
this striking demonstration, a num¬

ber of studies were initiated, first in
New York, then in Montreal, Bos¬
ton and Chicago. The conclusions
of the first of these studies were
given in June 1968 by Yahr and
collaborators89 at the annual meet¬
ing of the American Neurological
Association. They confirmed in
every way the previous studies of

many authors since 1961 and the
more evident results of the Cotzias approach with high doses of
L-dopa. Since June 1968, L-dopa
has been the subject of literally
hundreds of clinical trials. Some of
the earliest, already reported, are
listed in Table V. As of November
1969, more than 2000 patients have
been treated with L-dopa, under a
variety of protocol supplied by par¬
ticipating pharmaceutical houses or,
unfortunately, left to the whims and
fancy of the individual clinicians.
In general the results are in com¬
plete agreement as to overall im¬
provement, incidence of side effects
and limitations. Double-blind place¬
bo studies, carried out in particular
by Yahr et al.89 and by Timberlake,
Zieper and Schwab90 offer similar
encouraging results.

PERSONAL RESULTS
Since 1968, we have treated, for

periods exceeding two months,
86 patients, with progres¬
sively higher oral doses of L-dopa,
reaching a mean value of 4.3 g. per
day with a maximum of 7 g.* Our
detailed findings will be reported in
a companion paper to be published
later in this Journal. We will give
only a short summary at this time
because we believe these results are
fairly representative of the experi¬
ence of most groups.
The 86 subjects (62 men, 24
women) had a mean age of 59.7
years (range: 22-82). Eighty pa¬
tients had Parkinson's disease, in¬
cluding 10 with a possible history
of encephalitis; also included for
short-term control studies were one
case of dystonia musculorum deformans (aged 22), one of presenile dementia, one of senile de¬
mentia, one of Huntington's chorea,
one of luetic parkinsonism and one
of multiple sclerosis.
some

* Studies on these
patients were carried out in
the Hdtel-Dieu Hospital, the Clinical Research
Institute of Montreal, the Jewish Convalescent
Hospital and Maimonides Hospital, with the
collaboration in the latter two institutions of
Drs. Harold Mars, Israel Libman and Arthur
Schwartz.

The average dose used in Parkin¬
son's disease was 4.8 g. per day
with a range of 1.5 to 7.0 g. This
level was obtained after four to six
weeks in hospital with a very slow
upward titration similar to that used
by Cotzias.91 Performance of the
patients was measured by a battery
of tests previously described92*93
and the results, transposed into a
total score, are expressed as per¬
centage improvement over the base¬
line control period (Table VI).
Sixty-one of the 80 parkinsonian

patients (79%)

improved by
general per¬
formance. Moderate improvement,
usually manifested by modification
of one or more symptoms without
overall satisfactory changes, was ob¬
served in a further nine patients
(11%). There were eight failures,
due to side effects (two cases) or
absence of objective improvement
(six cases), despite maximum
dosage. To these must be added the
failures in the senile and presenile
dementia cases, in the luetic parkin¬
sonian patient and in one patient
with multiple sclerosis, and the in¬
stances of worsening of the symp¬
toms with relatively small doses (12 g. per day), viz. one case of
Huntington's chorea and one of
dystonia musculorum deformans.
The results in our series thus cor¬
respond closely to what has been
reported by Cotzias, Papavasiliou
were
more than 50% in their

and Gellene,94 Yahr et al.,95 McDowell et a/.96 and others.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
The most important factors in
obtaining significantly favourable
results and in avoiding major side
effects from L-dopa treatment ap¬
pear to be the gradual upward titra¬
tion of the oral dose as well as a
program of mobilization. If these
two principles are closely adhered
to, as outlined many times by
Cotzias, it is possible in almost aU
patients to reach a "plateau" doselevel of approximately 4 g. per day
without complications. In our opin-

ion this initial study, lasting from
four to six weeks, should be done
in hospital. At plateau level, if the
drug is well tolerated and if the
patient has obtained at least a 50%
improvement in functional capaci¬
ties as objectively measured, he can
be followed up regularly on an out¬
patient basis. By gradually and
slowly modifying the dose upward
or downward, it is possible to ob¬
tain even more improvement after
a further two to four months, with¬
out a recurrence of the initial annoying side effects of nausea,
vomiting, loss of appetite or postural hypotension.
In our experience there has been
at least partial improvement in al¬
most all symptoms of Parkinson's
disease in the majority (90%) of
patients. The degree of this im¬
provement is greater than that pre¬
viously obtained by conventional
anticholinergic or antihistaminic
medication and in most cases is
greater than the benefits obtained
with stereotaxic surgery. At first,
and until a dosage of nearly 2.5 g.
per day is reached, the improve¬
ment is mainly subjective. The pa¬
tient feels better, his mood is cheerful and he attempts to perform
tasks that have been beyond him
for many years. During this period
the significant drawbacks are nau¬
sea, occasional vomiting and a
striking loss of appetite. Most pa¬
tients will tolerate the morning
nausea if the dose is increased very
slowly. L-dopa must never be given
on an empty stomach. It is preferable to eat many small meals rather
than fewer heavy ones.

After reaching a dose of 3 g. per
day a significant and often sudden
improvement in motor functions and
in general performance occurs. The
exact level where this will take
place varies from patient to patient,
but is almost a constant phenome¬
non. From that point on, it is easy
to measure objective modifications
of signs. The beneficial effects of
L-dopa on the individual symptoms
of rigidity, akinesia, tremor, sialorrhea, gait and posture, memory,
mood, associated movements,
speech, handwriting, oculogyric
crises and even dysuria will be de¬
tailed in the companion paper. At
this time it is sufficient to mention
that the most striking effect appears
to be upon the hypokinesia mani¬
fested by loss of associated move¬
ments and upon postural and gait
impairment. Rigidity and hypokin¬
esia can at times be completely re¬
versed. On the other hand, tremor
is more refractory. At first, and con¬
comitant with a reduced rigidity,
there may be a slight increase in
the amplitude. Over the long term,
however, there is a definite decrease
in both amplitude and rate (to 3
per sec.) in most patients, with
eventual disappearance in a few.
This statement is applicable to the
classical, slow (3 to 8 per sec.) pos¬
tural tremor of Parkinson's disease.
L-dopa does not improve cerebellar,
senile or familial types of tremor;
in fact, it usually increases the lat¬
ter. This observation may therefore
suggest a pharmacological approach
to the understanding of the various

tremor mechanisms.

Canad. Med. Ass. J., Dec. 27. 1969, vol. 101.795.

The beneficial effects of L-dopa
do not appear to be modified or
limited by factors of age, severity of
disease or duration of symptoms.
However, the most severely affected
patients, because of other factors
such as arteriosclerosis or liver or
kidney dysfunction, have the high¬
est incidence of severe complica¬
tions. Previous stereotaxic surgery,
unless there are sequelae of pyramidal tract damage, is not a limiting
factor.
Even if the improvement can be
considered sustained, there is often
a marked variation in individual
to day or
performance from day Occasional
same

short-lasting refractory periods
varying from a few minutes to three
or four hours will occur in patients
who otherwise are perfectly control¬
led. During these episodes there is
often increased restlessness, a feel¬
ing of tension or of body warmth,
and excessive nasal discharge with
and even pupillary
hyperhidrosis
dilatation. These refractory periods
occur usually one to two hours after
an oral dose of L-dopa and are
worse after a heavy protein meal.
Similarly there may be episodes
of longer duration, lasting up to a
few weeks, with suboptimal per¬
formance despite maintenance of
the same dosage schedule. At such
times there is a marked increase in
freezing and the re-emergence of

tremor.

DISCUSSION OF SIDE EFFECTS
However encouraging the pros¬
pects, it must be stated that such
results are not obtained without
risks and complications. The inci¬

dence of side effects in our series is
listed in Table VII and will be de¬
tailed in the companion paper. An
analysis of these phenomena must
be included, because their under¬
standing will contribute toofthe even¬
tual success of this form therapy.
At this point, however, I would like
only to emphasize the following
items: nausea, vomiting, hypoten¬
sion, mental changes and abnormal

involuntary movements.
Nausea and vomiting, usually in
the morning, are seen at some stage
in almost all patients, but become
a clinical problem in only 40%. The
slower the rate of increase, the
slighter the manifestations. Vomit¬
ing has been a limiting factor of
63

treatment in only one of our pa¬
tients, who could not tolerate even

small doses of the drug.
Akinetic parkinsonian patients
generally have a blood pressure 15
to 20 mm. Hg below the average
for their age group. L-dopa, con-

trary to expectations, produced hy¬

pertension in only one patient. In

25 others we observed a fall in sys¬
tolic blood pressure greater than 20
mm. Hg. This finding usually lasted
three to six weeks and corresponded
to the adjustment period as regards
dose and mobilization. Usually the

phenomenon was not symptomatic
and blood pressure started to return
to normal during the second or
third month of therapy. In some
cases a rebound, but slight, hyper¬
tension could be observed after five
to six months. In nine patients,
however, the low blood pressure bocame symptomatic when the upright
posture was assumed. Light-headedness and vertigo were reported by
some patients, while actual syncope

farcts, one while playing tennis for

the first time in 15 years. Two pa¬
tients had minor focal motor seiz¬
ures. In one case this was proved
by gamma-encephalography to be
due to a small localized cerebral
infarct (embolus ?). Finally, one

patient suffered a cerebrovascular
accident with right hemiplegia and
aphasia after cutting down a large
tree. Although these episodes were
severe and should not be dismissed
lightly, in most cases the low blood
pressure could be corrected by the
usual measures, particularly the
wearing of elastic stockings or
pants.
Personality changes occurred in a
number of parkinsonians. The gen¬
eral mood-elevating and awakening
effect of L-dopa was observed in
most patients. However, this was oc¬
casionally accompanied by a false
sense of omnipotence and "insouciance". The judgment of some pa¬
tients in the face of major decisions
was often faulty. A behaviour pat¬
tern with frontal lobe overtones
was evident in some patients, es¬
pecially in the sexual sphere. A
clear-cut, visually evident increase
in libido occurred in at least four

64

male patients but, unfortunately,

erections were not sustained and
copulation was terminated with pre¬
mature ejaculation. It is difficult to
evaluate the presence or absence of
this effect in our female patients,
but we believe that it is present in
them as well.
In rare cases confusion, hallucinations and clearly psychotic be¬
haviour were present. The confu¬
sion resembled most closely a toxic
delirium. Vivid dreams with sexual
or paranoid features were present
on occasion. In other patients,
sleeplessness and agitation were the
rule. Paranoid manifestations were
probably the most frequent, but in
all cases such tendencies had been
manifested before treatment with ldopa and thus represented exacer¬
bations. In nine patients behaviour
manifestations took the paradoxical
form of a more severe depression,
with suicidal ideas. This occurred
mainly in patients with the less
marked improvement who lacked
motivation and who often had been
"expecting a miracle", because of
the excessive publicity given this
new form of treatment in the press.
The most striking, and important,
side effect is the production of ab¬
normal involuntary movements in
more than 50% of patients. This
phenomenon appears to be dose*
related and occurs approximately at
the time of optimal performance.
An important observation is that
when these dyskinesias appear, ten¬
don reflexes are weak and there
now is hypotonia. Very often pa¬
tients can predict the onset of these
movements through a strange feel¬
ing of warmth or tingling in the part
of the body eventually affected. The
types of movements observed are
almost as variable as the number
of patients. In Table VIII we have
listed most of the manifestations ob¬
served in our 80 patients with
Parkinson's disease. Usually the first
anomaly is in the cephalic sphere,
with orofaciobuccal movements
predominating. The tongue is unusually active, with slow or rapid
protrusion and rotation; gnawing or
chewing motions are also frequent.

Abnormal involuntary movements
in the limbs appear later, particu¬
larly in the hands. In fewer cases
the lower limbs are also involved.
When this is the case, severe atheto
sis, chorea-athetosis or ballismus
can occur.

We will describe these pheno¬
in more detail in another
paper because we believe they con¬
stitute the eventual major limiting
factor of present L-dopa therapy.
At this time, suffice it to say that
they occurred in 50% of our par¬
kinsonian patients, but could cer¬
tainly be found in almost 100% if
the level of L-dopa was pushed suf¬
ficiently high. To date they have
been reversible upon reducing the
dose of the drug, but in some cases
after a few months they have tended
to recur at progressively lower
doses. In one patient they appeared
first at 6.5 g. per day and are now
found, still with satisfactory reduc¬
tion of rigidity and akinesia, at a
level of 1.5 g. per day. At first
these movements, particularly if
they are limited to the face, are not
noticed by the patient himself. They
become bothersome mainly when
they affect the limbs or when the
peculiar wave-like nodding of the
head becomes severe. Although
most authors talk about chorea,
dystonia or tics, it is our opinion
that these dyskinesias differ marked¬
ly from what occurs in natural dis¬
orders of the basal ganglia. In some
ways they resemble the dyskinesias
seen during the acute phase of von
Economo's encephalitis or with
some phenothiazines. The cephalic
phenomena are very similar to the
so-called "tardive dyskinesias" of
drug therapy, but the latter usually
do not manifest themselves by the
severe limb movements seen while
the patient is receiving L-dopa.
Small doses of phenothiazines
mena

(Stelazine) or pyridoxine can re¬

duce some of these side effects. Un¬
fortunately, as the drugs improve
the dyskinesias, they adversely af¬
fect the parkinsonian state. This ob¬
servation is of importance in view
of the common habit of prescribing
proprietary vitamins for chronically
ill patients. Even the small amounts
of pyridoxine found in most such
preparations will eventually be suf¬
ficient to combat the effect of l-

dopa.

An interesting observation can
reported. In none of our
four non-parkinsonian patients,
even when taking comparable levels
of L-dopa for identical periods, did
we observe the slightest indication
of dyskinesia. This was particularly
evident in the patient with multiple

In conclusion, I would like to
mention some unusual, but not ne¬
cessarily uncommon, side effects of

L-dopa therapy. Many patients com¬
plain of a change in their sense of
taste, and food becomes tasteless
and often repulsive. Others become
able to smell different odours that
had been masked by anticholinergic
drugs. This is not always an ad¬
vantage, especially with hospital
food! Changes in the colour of

the patients, but these changes are
only a biochemical marker of the
presence of large amounts of L-

dopa.
Biochemically, very few changes
were noticed outside those related
to catecholamines. Initially a slight
increase in PBI was found in some
cases, but with changes in the coat¬
ing of the capsules this no longer
occurred. Transient small increases
in BUN were seen in 15 patients,
but could be reversed by forcing
fluids. More frequent were increases
in uric acid (49% of patients)
seen in an irregular manner. These
increases were not dose-related and
were quite variable. To date we
have not been able to explain this
finding, or to correlate it with any
definite modification of symptoms.
We did not observe hemolytic epi¬
sodes or granulocytopenia, except
transient minor decreases in total
leukocyte counts in three patients.

Canad. Med. Ass. J., Dec. 27, 1969, vol. 101.797.

After L-dopa, urinary dopamine and
homovanillic acid (HVA) levels, as
well as HVA levels in CSF, in¬
creased to a marked degree, with a
concomitant fall in 5 HIAA in the
urine. These findings will be re¬
ported in more detail elsewhere.

L-DOPA IN OTHER DISEASES
We have tried L-dopa in six pa¬
tients with other disorders of the
central nervous system. The drug
failed to produce any improvement
in multiple sclerosis, senile demen¬
tia, dystonia musculorum deformans
(one case) or Huntington's chorea
(one case). One patient with a presenile dementia with some features
of the Steele-Richardson-Olzewski
syndrome was improved as far as
his akinesia was concerned, but
there were no changes in his mental
functions. One patient with a purely
akinetic form of luetic parkinsonism
had a measurable improvement in
akinesia of 35%.
65

Many authors have used L-dopa

in other disease entities. Schildkraut
et al9S in 1963, Klerman et al99
also in 1963, Friend, Bell and
Kline100 in 1965 and more recently
Bunney et al91 in 1969 have re¬
re¬
ported some improvement in thenone
tarded form of depression, but
in the agitated form. Gottfries, Gottfries and Roos101 have indicated
that levels of HVA are low in senile
dementia, and it is therefore likely
that some effect of L-dopa will even¬
tually be observed in this condition,
despite our negative findings in a

single case.
At the 1969 meeting of the
American Neurological Association,
Coleman reported favourable ef¬
fects in three patients with dystonia
musculorum deformans. Good re¬
sults had previously been obtained
in spastic torticollis by Hirschmann
and Mayer102 in 1964 and by Pazzagli and Amaducci103 in 1966.
Wagshul and Daroff104 obtained
improvement in one patient with
progressive supranuclear palsy, but
failed to modify the symptoms in
another. Similar negative results
were reported by Gilbert and Feld¬
man105 and by Sacks.106
It would now appear that L-dopa

may be useful in cases other than
Parkinson's disease when there is a
significant degree of akinesia. Other¬
wise little effect has been observed
to date, except possibly in depres¬
sion. There is therefore an impor¬
tant need for more studies in this
field.
DOPA POTENTIATORS
Our own results, and those of
most other groups, clearly indicate
that L-dopa given in progressively
higher oral doses, as recommended
by Cotzias, is extremely useful in
the symptomatic treatment of
Parkinson's disease and in the extra¬
pyramidal syndrome of manganese
miners. However, peripheral and
central side effects such as nausea,
hypotension, abnormal involuntary
movements and mental changes
limit the long-term effectiveness of
L-dopa, and so does the very high
cost of this drug. It is obvious that
new ways will have to be found to
potentiate the antiparkinsonian ef¬
fect of dopa, while reducing the unwanted complications.
66

Many years ago, some authors re¬

ported on the value of inhibitors of
monoamine oxidase in alleviating

some of the symptoms of Parkin¬
son's disease.20'107-108 Trials of this
drug in conjunction with L-dopa,

however, proved dangerous17'52*109

because of hypertensive episodes
and were soon abandoned.
Conventional anticholinergic ther¬
apy has been found by most
authors to potentiate slightly the ef¬
fect of L-dopa, particularly upon
tremor.94'95 Recently, Schwab et
al.110 discovered some antiparkin¬
sonian action in amantadine hydro¬

chloride, a drug previously recom¬

mended for the prevention of cer¬
tain strains of Asian influenza.
Alone, amantadine appears to be
more effective than the usual anti¬
cholinergic drugs and to predict the
eventual benefit with L-dopa. In
combination with the amino-acid,
it is said to have a synergistic ef¬
fect. If these results are confirmed
by other groups, they will have
great theoretical and possible thera¬
peutic value.
In 1963, Pletscher and Gey111
reported that a serylhydrazine
derivative of trihydroxybenzyl, Ro
4-4602, inhibited at high doses
(500 mg. per kg.) extra- and intracerebral dopa-decarboxylase, with a
resulting drop in the concentrations
of serotonin, dopamine and nor¬
adrenaline. Later the same group,
with Bartholini, Burkard and Plet¬
scher,112 found that small doses (50
mg. per kg.) inhibited only peri¬
pheral decarboxylase, with a consequent increase in the intestinal ab¬
sorption of L-dopa, increases in
blood concentration of dopa and
decreases in metabolites such as
dopamine. The same inhibition of
decarboxylase in brain capillaries,
coupled with the high circulating
concentrations of the precursor, re^
sulted in an enhanced penetration of
dopa within the brain, with subse¬
quent metabolic degradation to do¬
pamine. Ro 4-4602 (Hoffmann-La
Roche) thus breaks down the bloodbrain-barrier to L-dopa.
This principle was first applied
to parkinsonian patients with
favourable results by Birkmayer
and Mentasti113 from 1964 to 1967
and in 1969 by Tissot and col¬
laborators114 in Geneva, by Siegfried et al.115 in Zurich, and by Barbeau and Gillo-Joffroy116 in Mon¬

treal Cotzias and Papavasiliou,88
.

using alpha-methyl-dopa hydrazine,
reported essentially similar results.
In short, the combination of a peri¬
pheral decarboxylase inhibitor and
L-dopa permitted reduction of the
amino-acid dose to approximately
1 g. per day, with a reduction in
the incidence of peripheral side ef¬
fects (nausea, vomiting and hypo¬
tension) and with beneficial effects
upon motor performance equal to
those observed after at least 4 g. of
L-dopa per day. Unfortunately the
incidence of dyskinesias is as high
as previously. To date the liver
toxicity reported in dogs given ex¬
tremely high doses of the drug have
not occurred in humans after al¬
most two years of continuous use
of Ro 4-4602. However, one must

be constantly aware of this potential
danger. New, more potent de¬
carboxylase inhibitors are now be¬

ing prepared.
Among the many possible ap¬
proaches that should be considered
in the future are the following:
1. Preparation of slow-release
capsules of dopa plus a decarboxylase-inhibitor combination.
2. Preparation of ether or ester
derivatives of L-dopa.
3. Search for possible chemical
analogues of both L-dopa and dopa¬
mine.
4. Search for substances, such as
apomorphine, which may directly
stimulate dopamine-sensitive recep¬
tors.

It is our opinion that L-dopa, as
it is presently used (November
1969), cannot yet be marketed be¬
cause of the cost, the cumbersome
dosage schedule and the possible
dangers of unsupervised usage. It is
to be hoped, however, that a suf¬
ficient supply will be made avail¬
able to qualified investigators, until
such time as one of the other ap¬
proaches mentioned above becomes
practicable. We believe that L-dopais
treatment of Parkinson's disease
only the first step to eventual suc¬
cess.

HOW DOES L-DOPA WORK?
We have reserved for the end a
a difficult and obviously impor¬
tant question. The present approach
to the treatment of Parkinson's dis¬
ease may be the result of the most
logical and direct chain of experi¬
ments in many years, but it is be-

.JQQ.Canad. Med. Ass. J., Dec. 27, 1969. vol. 101

coming increasingly evident that
logic is not always right. At the low
dosages used orally, or intravenously, until 1966, there is little
doubt that the antiparkinsonian effect was due to the cerebral transformation of dopa into dopamine,
particularly in the basal ganglia.
The arguments for this have been
thoroughly reviewed by Hornykiewicz.15 The problem of site and
mode of action, however, may be
completely different with the large
oral doses recommended by Cotzias
since 1966. In this respect it should
be mentioned that abnormal movements had not been observed with
L-dopa previous to these new high
levels.
It would now appear necessary
to distinguish two types of effects
of L-dOpa:
1. A specific action by replenishing depleted dopamine stores in
extrapyramidal centres and again
stimulating specific dopamine receptors.
2. A non-specific action which
may be mediated by dopa itself or
its direct metabolites (3-methoxy
dopa, for example) or abnormal
accumulation of by-products (unusual methylated metabolites) upon
the same centres, but more likely
upon other areas where these substances are usually in low concentration (cortex, hypothalamus,
brain stem). This non-specific
action of L-dopa may also be carried
out through the modification in
amino-acid or amine contents of
different parts of the brain brought
about by the large intake of dopa.

It is obvious that recent observations in neuropharmacology and
neurophysiology will have to be
integrated with clinical observations
to produce some understanding of
the mode of action of dopa in
Parkinson's disease and of the side
effects observed. For example, it
is probable that changes in other
amines, most likely serotonin and
tryptamine, produced either directly
by large amounts of dopa or indirectly through some sort of
balance system at the level of transport and uptake mechanisms, may
be responsible for some of the
psychiatric manifestations induced
during therapy. Similarly a phenomenon of denervation hypersensitivity of dopamine receptors in the
striatum may have to be invoked to
explain some of the dyskinesias produced in parkinsonian patients with
L-dopa, but not in normal control
subjects or patients with other nonextrapyramidal types of CNS involvement.
Finally, it must be mentioned that
dopa can produce some of its side
effects through purely peripheral
mechanisms. Recently we have
demonstrated117 that L-dopa will
further reduce the already low
plasma renin activity of akinetic
parkinsonian patients and by this
mechanism the complication of
hypotension may possibly be explained. The role of dopamine in
the postural control of blood pressure is presently under intensive
study in our laboratory.

During the last nine years the author's
studies have received the help of many
agencies. In particular we would like to
thank the Department of National
Health and Welfare (Ottawa), the
Ministry of Health (Quebec), the Medical Research Council (Grants Ma-1967,
Ma-2530, and SP-l), the W. Garfield
Weston Charitable Foundation, the
Canadian Mental Health Association and
many private benefactors. The technical
work was carried out by a large number
of devoted laboratory technicians under
the direction of Miss Th.r.se SaintPierre. We would also like to acknowledge the continued support of the Food
and Drug Directorate, Ottawa (Drs. R.
A. Chapman, J. Bishop and R. C. B.
Graham) in the clinical trials. L-dOpa
was purchased first from California Biochemicals, Los Angeles, and then from
Nutritional Biochemicals, Cleveland. Ro
4-4602 was kindly supplied by Dr. J.

maintenues relativement basses .
cause du coat de la drogue, les conclusions de ces essais jurent controversc.es. L'introduction en 1966 de
doses beaucoup plus .levc.es devait
permettre d'observer un ejjet incontestable. Cependant en parall.le
avec ces r6sultats prometteurs apparaissaient certains troubles secondaires tels l'hypotension et des
mouvements anormaux et involontaires. R.cemment de nouvelles approches ont . tent.es pour r.soudre
ce probl?me. Le r.sultat net, toutejois, est de bouleverser nos concepts
logiques, si bien .tablis, et de
remettre en question plusieurs donn.es exp.rimentales. Nous esp.rons
qu'ainsi il sera possible de trouver
une solution . cette angoissante
maladie.
